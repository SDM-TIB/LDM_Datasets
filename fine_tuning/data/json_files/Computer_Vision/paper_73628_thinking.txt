To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TetSphere Splatting: Representing High-Quality Geometry with Lagrangian Volumetric Meshes" by Minghao Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **Google Scanned Objects (GSO) dataset** for evaluation, which indicates that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In this case, I will focus on **section 6 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors discuss their evaluation methods and datasets. Here, they explicitly mention using the **GSO dataset** for single-view reconstruction tasks.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the GSO dataset. The paper cites the dataset as follows:

- **Google Scanned Objects (GSO) dataset**:
  > Downs, L., Francis, A., Koenig, N., Kinman, B., Hickman, R., Reymann, K., McHugh, T.B., Vanhoucke, V. (2022). *Google scanned objects: A High-Quality dataset of 3D scanned household items*. 

Since the paper primarily discusses the GSO dataset, I will ensure to note its significance in the context of the experiments conducted.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will allow for a clear understanding of the dataset's relevance and origin in the context of the research presented in the paper.
