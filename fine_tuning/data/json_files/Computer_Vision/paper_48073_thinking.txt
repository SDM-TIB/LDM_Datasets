To extract datasets from the research paper titled "High-Resolution Optical Flow from 1D Attention and Correlation" by Haofei Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on **Sintel**, **KITTI**, and **FlyingChairs** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors discuss their evaluation setups. Here, they explicitly mention using the **FlyingChairs** and **FlyingThings3D** datasets for pre-training, and then evaluating on **Sintel** and **KITTI** datasets. This confirms that these datasets are indeed utilized in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used:
1. **FlyingChairs Dataset**: A dataset used for training optical flow models, consisting of synthetic images with ground truth optical flow.
2. **FlyingThings3D Dataset**: Another synthetic dataset used for training, which includes diverse scenes and motion patterns.
3. **Sintel Dataset**: A benchmark dataset for optical flow evaluation, consisting of real-world scenes with ground truth flow annotations.
4. **KITTI Dataset**: A widely used dataset for evaluating optical flow and other computer vision tasks, containing real-world driving scenarios.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **FlyingChairs Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dosovitskiy, A., Fischer, P., Ilg, E., Hausser, P., Hazirbas, C., Golkov, V., ... & Brox, T. (2015). *FlowNet: Learning optical flow with convolutional networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2758–2766.

- For **FlyingThings3D Dataset**, the citation is:

- For **Sintel Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Butler, D. J., Wulff, J., Stanley, G. B., & Black, M. J. (2012). *A naturalistic open source movie for optical flow evaluation*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 611–625.

- For **KITTI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Geiger, A., Lenz, P., & Urtasun, R. (2012). *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3354–3361.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations to ensure that they are properly documented for future reference or processing.
