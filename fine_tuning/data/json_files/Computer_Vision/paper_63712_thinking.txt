To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HollowNeRF: Pruning Hashgrid-Based NeRFs with Trainable Collision Mitigation" by Xiufeng Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on "popular NeRF datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section (Section 4.1)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of dataset names or references to specific datasets. 

Upon reviewing Section 4.4, the authors state that they evaluate the performance of HollowNeRF on "3D scenes from the NeRF synthetic dataset" and the "Tanks and Temples dataset." This gives me the names of the datasets used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **NeRF synthetic dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P. Srinivasan, Matthew Tancik, Jonathan T. Barron, Ravi Ramamoorthi, and Ren Ng. *NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2020.

2. For the **Tanks and Temples dataset**, the citation is:
   > Arno Knapitsch, Jaesik Park, Qian-Yi Zhou, and Vladlen Koltun. *Tanks and Temples: Benchmarking Large-Scale Scene Reconstruction*. ACM Transactions on Graphics, 36(4), 2017.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **NeRF synthetic dataset**: A dataset used for training and evaluating neural radiance fields, consisting of various 3D scenes.
- **Tanks and Temples dataset**: A benchmark dataset for large-scale scene reconstruction, providing a variety of complex scenes for evaluation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the descriptions. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
