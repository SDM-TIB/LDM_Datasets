To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Valuing Uncertainties in Wind Generation: An Agent-Based Optimization Approach" by Daniel Shen and Marija Ilic, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and case study sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the evaluation of a modified version of the RTS-GMLC system, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this system.

Next, in the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of "wind timeseries data" and refer to the RTS-GMLC system. This indicates that there is a dataset associated with the RTS-GMLC system, which I need to explore further.

In the **methods section**, the authors describe the simulation of operations on the RTS-GMLC system and mention using **PGScen** to create representative load and wind scenarios. This suggests that PGScen is a tool or dataset used in their analysis.

Moving to the **case study section**, the authors specify that they simulated operations over two consecutive days (2020-07-17 to 2020-07-18) using the RTS-GMLC system. They also mention the generation capacities and modifications made to the RTS-GMLC system, which further confirms the relevance of this dataset.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **RTS-GMLC System**: The citation for the RTS-GMLC system is:
   > C. Barrows et al., “The IEEE Reliability Test System: A Proposed 2019 Update,” *IEEE Transactions on Power Systems*, vol. 35, no. 1, Jul. 2019.

2. **PGScen**: The citation for PGScen is:
   > R. Carmona and X. Yang, “Joint Stochastic Model for Electric Load, Solar and Wind Power at Asset Level and Monte Carlo Scenario Generation,” Sep. 2022, preprint.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
