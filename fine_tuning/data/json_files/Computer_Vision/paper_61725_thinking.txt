To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretable Alzheimer’s Disease Classification Via a Contrastive Diffusion Autoencoder" by Ayodeji Ijishakin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a dataset of 2D MRI images for classifying Alzheimer’s Disease, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset and Pre-processing)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that their dataset consists of **6137 3D structural T1-weighted MR images**, with a breakdown of the classes (AD=1105, HC=5032). This section also notes that the data were drawn from **10 publicly available datasets**.

The authors list the specific datasets used to curate their dataset:
1. **Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL)**
2. **Dallas Lifespan Brain Study**
3. **Nathan Kline Institute Rocklands Sample**
4. **Open Access Series of Imaging Studies-1**
5. **Southwest University Adult Lifespan Dataset**
6. **Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)**
7. **National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center**
8. **CamCAN**

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the requirements. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
