To extract datasets from the research paper titled "From Principal Subspaces to Principal Components with Linear Autoencoders" by Elad Plaut, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of autoencoders for PCA, but does not explicitly mention datasets. However, the introduction provides context for the experiments, which may include dataset references.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) closely, as this is where datasets are typically described in detail. In this section, the author mentions two datasets used for training the linear autoencoder:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 60,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits, each of size 28 × 28. The author indicates that they trained a linear autoencoder on this dataset.

2. **CUB-200-2011 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 11,788 color images of birds, resized to 256 × 256. The author mentions applying the same technique to this dataset for dimensionality reduction.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. LeCun, C. Cortes, and C. Burges. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. 2010.

- For the **CUB-200-2011 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. Wah, S. Branson, P. Welinder, P. Perona, and S. Belongie. *The Caltech-UCSD birds-200-2011 dataset*. No. CNS-TR-2011-001, 2011.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now summarize the datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: Contains 60,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits, each of size 28 × 28. Used for training a linear autoencoder.

2. **CUB-200-2011 Dataset**: Contains 11,788 color images of birds, resized to 256 × 256. Used for applying PCA using a linear autoencoder.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
