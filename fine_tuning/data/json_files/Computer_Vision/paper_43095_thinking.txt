To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Style Mining for One-Shot Unsupervised Domain Adaptation" by Yawei Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on cross-domain classification and segmentation benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Protocols)**, as this section is likely to provide detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors explicitly mention the datasets utilized for their evaluation:

1. **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits used for classification tasks. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, Patrick Haffner, et al. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

2. **USPS**: Another dataset of handwritten digits, often used in conjunction with MNIST for domain adaptation tasks. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Jonathan J. Hull. *A database for handwritten text recognition research*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 16(5):550–554, 1994.

3. **SVHN**: A dataset containing images of house numbers from real-world scenes, used for classification tasks. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. 2011.

4. **SYNTHIA**: A synthetic dataset for semantic segmentation, used as a source domain in the experiments. The citation for this dataset is:
   > German Ros, Laura Sellart, Joanna Materzynska, David Vazquez, and Antonio M Lopez. *The SYNTHIA dataset: A large collection of synthetic images for semantic segmentation of urban scenes*. In CVPR, 2016.

5. **Cityscapes**: A real-world dataset for semantic segmentation, used as a target domain in the experiments. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The Cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In CVPR, 2016.

6. **GTA5**: A dataset containing images from the video game Grand Theft Auto V, used for domain adaptation tasks. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Stephan R Richter, Vibhav Vineet, Stefan Roth, and Vladlen Koltun. *Playing for data: Ground truth from computer games*. In ECCV, 2016.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile their full citations accurately, as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly listed along with its citation for easy reference.
