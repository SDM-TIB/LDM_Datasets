To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LAMP: Learn A Motion Pattern for Few-Shot-Based Video Generation" by Ruiqi Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a few-shot tuning framework for video generation, which suggests that specific datasets may be referenced later in the paper. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or video sets in these sections.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any specific video sets mentioned, as well as details about their characteristics, such as the number of videos, types of motions, and any relevant annotations.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using a set of self-collected videos for training, specifically noting that they use 8 to 16 videos for each motion case. They also describe various motion cases, including "helicopter," "waterfall," "horse running," and others. However, they do not provide specific dataset names or citations for these self-collected videos, which may imply that they are not publicly available datasets.

To ensure thoroughness, I will also look at the **references section** to see if any of the cited works correspond to datasets that could be relevant to the experiments conducted in this paper. I will pay particular attention to any references that discuss video datasets or benchmarks in the context of video generation or motion learning.

After identifying any datasets mentioned, I will compile the full citations for each dataset. If the authors refer to publicly available datasets, I will ensure to include the complete citation format as per the conventions used in the paper.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Review the experiments section for specific datasets used.
3. Check the references for any relevant datasets or benchmarks.
4. Compile full citations for any identified datasets.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets referenced in the paper.
