To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Unsupervised Feature Selection by Discarding Nuisance and Correlated Features" by Uri Shaham et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method on "several real-world datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to identify them specifically.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in **section 5**, where they mention using "ten real-world datasets" for their evaluations. This is a strong indication that specific datasets will be listed.

I will then carefully read through **section 5.2 (Real world datasets)**, where the authors provide a table summarizing the properties of the datasets used in their experiments. The table includes the names of the datasets, their dimensions, sample sizes, and the accuracy achieved using all features. The datasets listed are:

1. **RCV1**: A dataset with 21,332 samples and 24,408 dimensions.
2. **GISETTE**: A dataset with 6,000 samples and 4,955 dimensions.
3. **PIX10**: A dataset with 10,000 samples and 10,000 dimensions.
4. **COIL20**: A dataset with 1,440 samples and 1,024 dimensions.
5. **Yale**: A dataset with 165 samples and 1,024 dimensions.
6. **TOX-171**: A dataset with 5748 samples and 7,192 dimensions.
7. **ALLAML**: A dataset with 72 samples and 6,066 dimensions.
8. **PROSTATE**: A dataset with 102 samples and 5,966 dimensions.
9. **FAN**: A dataset with 301 samples and 25,683 dimensions.
10. **POLLEN**: A dataset with 56 samples and 21,810 dimensions.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations may not be explicitly listed in the paper, so I will need to search for them in the literature or online databases.

For example, I can find the citation for the **RCV1 dataset** as follows:
- **RCV1**: Lewis, D. D., Yang, Y., Rose, T. G., & Li, F. (2004). *RCV1: A New Benchmark Collection for Text Categorization Research*. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 5, 361-397.

I will repeat this process for each dataset, ensuring that I provide accurate and complete citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, dimensions, sample sizes, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
