To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ET3D: Efficient Text-to-3D Generation via Multi-View Distillation" by Yiming Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the challenges of text-to-3D generation due to the scarcity of 3D assets, which suggests that the authors may reference specific datasets used in their experiments or related work. 

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to identify any datasets explicitly mentioned. In section 4.1, the authors describe their implementation details and mention constructing a substantial dataset comprising 5,000 different prompts and 800,000 generated images. However, they do not specify a named dataset here, which indicates that they may have generated their own dataset for training.

I will also check the **related work section** (section 2) for any references to existing datasets that might have been used in previous studies. The authors discuss various methods and datasets, including ShapeNet, which is a well-known dataset in the field of 3D modeling.

In the **references section**, I will look for full citations of any datasets mentioned in the paper. For instance, if ShapeNet is referenced, I will ensure to include its full citation. The citation for ShapeNet is:
> Angel X. Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, Leonidas Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qixing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Hao Su, Jianxiong Xiao, Li Yi, and Fisher Yu. *ShapeNet: An Information-Rich 3D Model Repository*. Technical Report arXiv:1512.03012 [cs.GR], Stanford University — Princeton University — Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **Custom Dataset**: Comprising 5,000 different prompts and 800,000 generated images at a resolution of 256 × 256 pixels. This dataset was created for the purpose of training their model but does not have a formal citation since it is not a publicly available dataset.

2. **ShapeNet**: A widely used dataset in 3D modeling and generation tasks.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for any datasets referenced in the paper. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations for further processing or review.
