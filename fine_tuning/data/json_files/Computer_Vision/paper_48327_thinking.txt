To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalized Few-Shot Object Detection without Forgetting" by Zhibo Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on few-shot detection benchmarks," which suggests that specific datasets are used, but I need to find their names.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of few-shot object detection and the need for effective learning under low-data regimes. They reference "few-shot detection benchmarks," which indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find explicit names.

I will then examine the **experiments section** (specifically section 4.1) where the authors detail their experimental settings. Here, they mention evaluating their method on well-established few-shot detection benchmarks based on **MS-COCO** and **Pascal VOC**. This is a clear indication that these two datasets are central to their research.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets:

1. **MS-COCO**: The citation is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and Lawrence C. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755, 2014.

2. **Pascal VOC**: The citation is:
   > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2):303–338, 2010.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper, along with their full citations.
