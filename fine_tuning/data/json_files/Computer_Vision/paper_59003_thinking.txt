To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LEVEL UP THE DEEPFAKE DETECTION: A METHOD TO EFFECTIVELY DISCRIMINATE IMAGES GENERATED BY GAN ARCHITECTURES AND DIFFUSION MODELS" by Luca Guarnera et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors collected a dedicated dataset of pristine images and fake ones generated by various GAN and Diffusion Models. This suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details. The introduction discusses the classification tasks and mentions the need for a dataset that includes both real and synthetic images. However, it does not provide specific names of datasets.

I will then focus on **section 2 (Dataset Details)**, which is likely to contain the most relevant information about the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors describe the dataset as a collection of real images from CelebA, FFHQ, and ImageNet, along with synthetic images generated by various GANs and Diffusion Models. 

The specific datasets mentioned are:

1. **CelebA**: A large-scale face attributes dataset with over 200,000 celebrity images, each annotated with 40 attribute labels.
2. **FFHQ (Flickr-Faces-HQ)**: A high-quality dataset of human faces, consisting of 70,000 images at 1024x1024 resolution.
3. **ImageNet**: A large visual database designed for use in visual object recognition software research, containing millions of images across thousands of categories.

Additionally, the authors mention the synthetic data generated by the following GAN architectures:
- **AttGAN**
- **CycleGAN**
- **GDWCT**
- **IMLE**
- **ProGAN**
- **StarGAN**
- **StarGAN-v2**
- **StyleGAN**
- **StyleGAN2**

And the following Diffusion Models:
- **DALL-E 2**
- **GLIDE**
- **Latent Diffusion**

For each GAN, 2,500 images were generated, totaling 22,500 synthetic images, while for the DMs, 5,000 images were created for each architecture, resulting in 20,000 synthetic images. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Z. Liu, P. Luo, X. Wang, and X. Tang. "Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild." In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2015, pp. 3730–3738.

- For **FFHQ**, the citation is:
  > T. Karras, T. Aila, S. Laine, and J. Lehtinen. "Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability, and Variation." arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.10196, 2017.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > O. Russakovsky, J. Deng, H. Su, J. Krause, S. Satheesh, S. Ma, Z. Huang, A. Karpathy, A. Khosla, M. Bernstein, et al. "ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge." International Journal of Computer Vision, vol. 115, pp. 211–252, 2015.

- For the GAN architectures and Diffusion Models, I will note that they are referenced in the paper but do not have specific dataset citations as they are methods rather than standalone datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and attributed correctly.
