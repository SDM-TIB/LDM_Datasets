To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Confidence-Based Feature Imputation for Graphs with Partially Known Features" by Daeho Um et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on various datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention six benchmark datasets from two different domains: citation networks and recommendation networks. The datasets listed are:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset with 2,485 nodes, 5,069 edges, and 1,433 features.
2. **CiteSeer**: Another citation network dataset with 2,120 nodes, 3,679 edges, and 3,703 features.
3. **PubMed**: A larger citation network dataset with 19,717 nodes, 44,324 edges, and 500 features.
4. **Amazon-Computers**: A recommendation network dataset with 13,381 nodes, 245,778 edges, and 767 features.
5. **Amazon-Photo**: Another recommendation network dataset with 7,487 nodes, 119,043 edges, and 745 features.
6. **OGBN-Arxiv**: A large-scale citation network dataset with 169,343 nodes, 1,166,243 edges, and 128 features.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
