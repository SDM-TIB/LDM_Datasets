To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Multi-CLIP: Contrastive Vision-Language Pre-training for Question Answering tasks in 3D Scenes" by Alexandros Delitzas et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their approach on downstream tasks of 3D Visual Question Answering (3D-VQA) and 3D Situated Question Answering (3D-SQA), which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, in the **introduction**, the authors reference two benchmarks: **ScanQA** and **SQA3D**. This is a strong indication that these are the datasets used for their experiments, but I need to confirm this by locating more detailed descriptions.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors provide a clear description of the datasets used:

1. **ScanQA**: This dataset contains 41,363 diverse question-answer pairs and 3D object localization annotations for 800 indoor 3D scenes derived from the ScanNet dataset. It is specifically designed for the task of 3D Visual Question Answering.

2. **SQA3D**: This dataset includes around 6,800 unique situations based on 650 ScanNet scenes, along with 20,400 descriptions and 33,400 diverse reasoning questions. It is tailored for the task of 3D Situated Question Answering.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper:

- For **ScanQA**, the citation is:
  > Daichi Azuma, Taiki Miyanishi, Shuhei Kurita, and Motoki Kawanabe. *ScanQA: 3D question answering for spatial scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2022.

- For **SQA3D**, the citation is:
  > Xiaojian Ma, Silong Yong, Zilong Zheng, Qing Li, Yitao Liang, Song-Chun Zhu, and Siyuan Huang. *SQA3D: Situated question answering in 3D scenes*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2023.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
