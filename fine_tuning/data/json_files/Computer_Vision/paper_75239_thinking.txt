To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LaSe-E2V: Towards Language-guided Semantic-Aware Event-to-Video Reconstruction" by Kanghao Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three datasets, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for understanding the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Implementation Details)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they state that they utilized both synthetic and real-world datasets, specifically mentioning:

1. **MS-COCO Dataset**: This dataset is used to generate event and video sequences through the v2e event simulator. It is a well-known dataset for object detection and segmentation tasks.

2. **BS-ERGB Dataset**: This dataset includes 1,000 training sequences and is used to enrich semantic information.

3. **Event Camera Dataset (ECD)**: This dataset is used for evaluation and is specifically designed for pose estimation and visual odometry tasks.

4. **Multi Vehicle Stereo Event Camera (MVSEC) Dataset**: Another dataset used for evaluation, which focuses on 3D perception.

5. **High-Quality Frames (HQF) Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned for evaluation purposes.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
