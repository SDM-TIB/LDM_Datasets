To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Design Booster: A Text-Guided Diffusion Model for Image Translation with Spatial Layout Preservation" by Shiqi Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the method's capabilities but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will look for specific references to datasets in the introduction and experiments sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of image translation and mention existing methods but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, I will look for subsections that might detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. The authors mention deploying their method on the **Stable Diffusion model** and training on images from the **Laion dataset**. This indicates that the Laion dataset is a key dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Laion dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **Laion dataset**:
  > Christoph Schuhmann, Richard Vencu, Romain Beaumont, Robert Kaczmarczyk, Clayton Mullis, Aarush Katta, Theo Coombes, Jenia Jitsev, and Aran Komatsuzaki. *Laion-400m: Open dataset of clip-filtered 400 million image-text pairs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.02114, 2021.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the **Laion dataset** is the primary dataset referenced in this research.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the Laion dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will be ready for downstream processing or review.
