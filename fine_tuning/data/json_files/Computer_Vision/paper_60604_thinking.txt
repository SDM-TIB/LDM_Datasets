To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TR0N: Translator Networks for 0-Shot Plug-and-Play Conditional Generation" by Zhaoyan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention achieving a zero-shot FID of 10.9 on **MS-COCO**, indicating that this dataset is used for evaluation. This is a strong indication that I should look for more details about this dataset in the paper.

Next, I will check the **experiments** section, specifically looking for any subsections that detail the datasets used. In the experiments section, the authors describe their methodology and results, and they mention using **CIFAR-10** and **MS-COCO** for their experiments. This confirms that both datasets are relevant to their work.

I will also look for any specific **dataset descriptions** or references in the **related work** or **background** sections, as these sections often provide context on the datasets used in the experiments. The authors reference **CLIP** and its use with **BigGAN** and **StyleGAN**, but they do not introduce any new datasets beyond those already mentioned.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets:

1. **MS-COCO**: The citation is:
   > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., DollÃ¡r, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context. In European conference on computer vision (pp. 740-755). Springer.

2. **CIFAR-10**: The citation is:
   > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Master's thesis, University of Toronto.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

- **MS-COCO**: A dataset used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method, with a focus on text-to-image generation tasks.
- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset used for class-conditional generation experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
