To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An attempt to generate new bridge types from latent space of PixelCNN" by Wanshi Antecedence and Hongjun Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss the methodology and experiments** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a "symmetric structured image dataset of three-span beam bridge, arch bridge, cable-stayed bridge, and suspension bridge." This suggests that there is a dataset involved, but I need to gather more details.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (An attempt to generate new bridge types from latent space of PixelCNN)**, specifically the **subsection 2.1 (Dataset)**. Here, the authors describe the dataset used, which includes various types of bridges. They mention that the dataset consists of two subcategories for each type of bridge, with a total of 9600 images across different bridge types. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's structure and content.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** for any papers that might have originally introduced or described the dataset. The authors reference their previous works [2-3], which likely contain the original dataset details. 

The citations for these previous works are:
- For the dataset used in this paper, the citation is:
  > Hongjun Zhang. *An attempt to generate new bridge types from latent space of variational autoencoder*. arXiv preprint, 2023, arXiv:2311.03380.

- Another relevant citation is:
  > Hongjun Zhang. *An attempt to generate new bridge types from latent space of generative adversarial network*. arXiv preprint, 2024, arXiv:2401.00700.

Since the dataset is derived from the author's previous research, I will ensure to include these citations when describing the dataset.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset description and the full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified and properly referenced. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
