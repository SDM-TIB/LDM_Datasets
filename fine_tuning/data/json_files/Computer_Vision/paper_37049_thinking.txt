To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-Supervised Learning with Generative Adversarial Networks" by Augustus Odena, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses extending GANs to a semi-supervised context, but it does not specify any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

In the **introduction**, the author mentions using generative models for tasks like MNIST images. This indicates that the MNIST dataset is likely used, but I need to confirm this in the results section.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, where the author explicitly states that experiments were conducted on the **MNIST dataset**. This is a clear identification of a dataset used in the research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation for the MNIST dataset is:

- **MNIST Dataset**:
  > Yann LeCun, LÃ©on Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 1998.

Since the paper primarily discusses the MNIST dataset and does not mention any other datasets, I will compile this information.

I will create an entry for the MNIST dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
