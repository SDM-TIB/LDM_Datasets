To extract datasets from the research paper titled "In situ digestion of canola protein gel observed by synchrotron X-Ray Scattering" by Maja Napieraj et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data collection methods.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of their research, including the use of synchrotron Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) to analyze protein digestion. I will note any specific datasets or experimental conditions mentioned that could indicate the presence of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors describe their experimental setup and procedures. This section is crucial as it often contains detailed information about the datasets used, including sample preparation, measurement techniques, and any specific datasets generated during the experiments. I will look for any references to datasets, including their sizes, types, and any relevant parameters.

In the **results section**, I will examine the data presented, including figures, tables, and any statistical analyses. The authors may refer to specific datasets or results derived from their experiments, which will help in identifying the datasets used.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is important for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the study.

Based on my reading, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **SAXS Data from Canola Protein Gel Digestion**: This dataset includes the scattering intensity measurements collected during the in situ digestion of the canola protein gel using SAXS. The authors describe the time-resolved measurements and the conditions under which the data were collected.

2. **INFOGEST Protocol Data**: This dataset pertains to the standardized static in vitro digestion method used in the study, which is referenced in the context of the experimental setup.

Now, I will retrieve the full citations for these datasets from the references section:

- For the SAXS data, the citation is:
  > Napieraj, M., Brûlet, A., Lutton, E., Randrianarisoa, U., Boire, A., & Boué, F. (2022). Monitoring food structure in plant protein gels during digestion: rheometry and Small Angle Neutron Scattering studies. *Food Structure*, 32, 100270. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foostr.2022.100270

- For the INFOGEST protocol, the citation is:
  > Minekus, M., Alminger, M., Alvito, P., Ballance, S., Bohn, T., Bourlieu, C., et al. (2014). A standardized static in vitro digestion method suitable for food - an international consensus. *Food Function*, 5, 1113-1124. https://doi.org/10.1039/c3fo60702j

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations for further processing or review.
