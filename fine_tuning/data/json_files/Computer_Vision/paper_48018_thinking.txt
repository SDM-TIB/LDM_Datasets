To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Eccentric Regularization: Minimizing Hyperspherical Energy without explicit projection" by Xuefeng Li and Alan Blair, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the effectiveness of the proposed method as a regularizer for an image autoencoder, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Autoencoder Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training their models. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The authors state that they trained their Eccentric Autoencoder on the MNIST dataset for 1000 epochs using various latent dimensions. This dataset is well-known for handwritten digit recognition and consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

2. **CelebA Dataset**: The authors also mention using the CelebA dataset for training their autoencoder for 100 epochs. This dataset contains over 200,000 celebrity images, each annotated with 40 attribute labels, making it suitable for tasks involving facial recognition and attribute classification.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For the **CelebA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In ICCV, pages 3730–3738, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This process ensures that I accurately capture the datasets utilized in the research and provide proper attribution to the original sources.
