To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Preﬁx Conditioning Uniﬁes Language and Label Supervision" by Kuniaki Saito et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of web-scale image-caption datasets and classifies datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In **Section 4.1 (Setup)**, the authors mention using **CC3M** and **CC12M** as image-caption datasets, and **ImageNet21K** and **ImageNet1K** as image classification datasets. This is a clear indication that these datasets are central to their experiments.

I will then look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the text. In **Table 1**, the authors provide a summary of the datasets used, including their sizes and objectives. This table confirms the datasets mentioned earlier.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **CC3M (Conceptual Captions 3M)**:
   > Sharma, P., Ding, N., Goodman, S., & Soricut, R. (2018). Conceptual captions: A cleaned, hypernymed, image alt-text dataset for automatic image captioning. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 2556–2565.

2. **CC12M (Conceptual Captions 12M)**:
   > Changpinyo, S., Sharma, P., Ding, N., & Soricut, R. (2021). Conceptual 12M: Pushing web-scale image-text pre-training to recognize long-tail visual concepts. In CVPR.

3. **ImageNet21K**:
   > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248–255.

4. **ImageNet1K**:
   > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., et al. (2015). ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3), 211-252.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper, along with their proper citations for future reference.
