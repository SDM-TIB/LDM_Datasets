To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Easing Color Shifts in Score-Based Diffusion Models" by Katherine Deck and Tobias Bischoff, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the investigation of color shifts in generated images and references the use of specific datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **FashionMNIST**: This dataset is described as having around 60,000 data points with a resolution of 28x28 pixels. The authors note that they create interpolated versions at various resolutions (32x32, 64x64, 128x128, 256x256, and 512x512 pixels) to explore the color shift magnitude as a function of image size.

2. **Two-dimensional fluid flow simulation dataset**: This dataset consists of 800 samples of 512x512 images with multiple channels corresponding to different dynamical state variables, specifically focusing on the moisture supersaturation field.

In the same section, the authors provide a reference to a previous work by Bischoff and Deck, which gives additional context about the fluid flow dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **FashionMNIST**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. 2017.

- For the **fluid flow dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tobias Bischoff and Katherine Deck. *Unpaired Downscaling of Fluid Flows with Diffusion Bridges*. 2023.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
