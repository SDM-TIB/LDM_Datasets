To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online Adaptation of Deep Architectures with Reinforcement Learning" by Thushan Ganegedara, Lionel Ott, and Fabio Ramos, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed method and its evaluation on three datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In **section 4.1**, they mention that the experiments are based on extended versions of three datasets: **MNIST**, **MNIST-rot-back**, and **CIFAR-10**. They specify that these datasets consist of 1,000,000 examples each, which were masked with noise to create unique instances.

To ensure I have the correct details, I will look for any additional information about these datasets in the **background or methodology sections**. However, the main details about the datasets are already provided in section 4.1.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. Available: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

- For **MNIST-rot-back**, this dataset is a variation of MNIST, and while it may not have a separate citation, it is typically referenced in conjunction with the original MNIST dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation for proper attribution. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or processing.
