To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Learn Graph Topologies" by Xingyue Pu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention any datasets used. In this case, the authors discuss experiments on both synthetic and real-world data, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they generated random graphs from various models, including the Barabási-Albert (BA), Erdös-Rényi (ER), stochastic block model (SBM), and Watts–Strogatz (WS) models. This indicates that these models serve as the basis for the datasets used in their experiments.

I will also check the **real-world applications section** (Section 6) to identify any specific datasets mentioned. The authors refer to two real-world datasets: the S&P 100 Stock Returns and a dataset for the Assistant Diagnosis of Autism, which contains BOLD time series data from subjects with autism spectrum disorder.

Now, I will compile the details of each dataset:

1. **Synthetic Datasets**:
   - **Barabási-Albert (BA) Model**: Used to generate scale-free graphs.
   - **Erdös-Rényi (ER) Model**: Used to generate random sparse graphs.
   - **Stochastic Block Model (SBM)**: Used to create community-structured graphs.
   - **Watts–Strogatz (WS) Model**: Used to generate small-world networks.

2. **Real-World Datasets**:
   - **S&P 100 Stock Returns**: This dataset includes daily returns of stocks from the S&P 100 index, sourced from Yahoo Finance.
   - **ABIDE Dataset**: This dataset contains BOLD time series data from 539 subjects with autism spectrum disorder and 573 typical controls, sourced from the Preprocessed Connectomes Project.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the real-world datasets are particularly important, as they provide the necessary details for proper attribution.

- For the **S&P 100 Stock Returns**, the citation is:
  > Yahoo Finance. *S&P 100 Stock Returns*. Available at: https://finance.yahoo.com/

- For the **ABIDE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Di Martino, A., et al. *The Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange: Towards a large-scale evaluation of the intrinsic brain architecture in autism*. NeuroImage, 2017.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its source. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
