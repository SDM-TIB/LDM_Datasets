To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combined space-time reduced-order model with 3D deep convolution for extrapolating fluid dynamics" by Indu Kant Deo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors discuss the training strategy. Here, they mention generating a training dataset with 41 Reynolds numbers, leading to 41 separate runs to generate the data. This indicates that there is a dataset related to fluid flow simulations based on varying Reynolds numbers.

In the **training strategy subsection**, the authors detail how the training set is constructed, mentioning that for each Reynolds number, they have 501 time steps of fluid flow data. They also describe how this data is processed into input and output samples, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

I will also check the **numerical results section** to see if the authors provide any additional information about the datasets used for testing or validation. They mention testing data sets generated with Reynolds numbers ranging from 20 to 300, which indicates another dataset used for evaluation.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The primary dataset appears to be generated from the open-source CFD framework **Basilisk**, which is used for simulating fluid flow. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, but they reference the framework used to generate the data.

The relevant citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **Training Dataset**: Generated from fluid flow simulations at various Reynolds numbers using the Basilisk framework.
   > Popinet, S. (2013). *Basilisk*. Retrieved from http://basilisk.fr

2. **Testing Dataset**: Generated with Reynolds numbers ranging from 20 to 300, processed similarly to the training dataset.
   > Popinet, S. (2013). *Basilisk*. Retrieved from http://basilisk.fr

With this information, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations as required.
