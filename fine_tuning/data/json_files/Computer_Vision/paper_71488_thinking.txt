To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DiSR-NeRF: Diffusion-Guided View-Consistent Super-Resolution NeRF" by Jie Long Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves better results on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will review the **experiments section** (section 4) to find detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In section 4.2, the authors explicitly state the datasets they evaluated their models on:

1. **NeRF-synthetic Dataset**: This dataset contains 8 synthetic subjects and is used for training with low-resolution images of 400×400 resolution and rendering at 1600×1600 resolution.

2. **LLFF Dataset**: This dataset consists of 8 real-world scenes. The authors mention training over low-resolution images of 504×378 resolution and rendering at 2016×1512 resolution.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. 

For the **NeRF-synthetic Dataset**, the citation is:
> Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P. Srinivasan, Matthew Tancik, Jonathan T. Barron, Ravi Ramamoorthi, and Ren Ng. *NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2020.

For the **LLFF Dataset**, the citation is:
> Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P. Srinivasan, Rodrigo Ortiz-Cayon, Nima Khademi Kalantari, Ravi Ramamoorthi, Ren Ng, and Abhishek Kar. *Local Light Field Fusion: Practical View Synthesis with Prescriptive Sampling Guidelines*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 2019.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
