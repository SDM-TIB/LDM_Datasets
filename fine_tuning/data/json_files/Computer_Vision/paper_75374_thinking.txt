To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Complete Causal Explanation with Expert Knowledge" by Aparajithan Venkateswaran and Emilija PerkoviÄ‡, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract typically summarizes the key contributions and may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors usually describe the datasets in detail. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant statistics or descriptions provided by the authors. This section often contains the most comprehensive information about the datasets used in the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source for the datasets, allowing others to locate them easily.

For each dataset identified, I will ensure to note:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, features).
3. The full citation as provided in the references section of the paper.

Once I have gathered all this information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are well-documented and easily accessible for future reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Examine the experiments section for detailed descriptions of datasets.
3. Check the references for full citations of each dataset.
4. Document each dataset with its name, description, and citation.
