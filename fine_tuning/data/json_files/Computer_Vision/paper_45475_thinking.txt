To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Empirical Study of Domain-Agnostic Semi-Supervised Learning via Energy-Based Models: Joint-Training and Pre-Training" by Yunfu Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses semi-supervised learning methods and mentions experiments conducted across different data modalities, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors detail their experiments on standard benchmark datasets. Here, they explicitly mention the datasets used for image classification and natural language labeling tasks.

In **section 4.1 (SSL for Image Classification)**, the authors state that they conducted experiments on the **CIFAR-10** and **SVHN** datasets. They describe the CIFAR-10 dataset as containing 50,000 training images across 10 classes and the SVHN dataset as containing 73,257 labeled digits from real-world house numbers.

In **section 4.2 (SSL for Natural Language Labeling)**, the authors mention using the **PTB POS tagging**, **CoNLL-2000 chunking**, and **CoNLL-2003 English NER** datasets. They describe these datasets as standard benchmark datasets for natural language processing tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

2. For **SVHN**, the citation is:
   > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2011.

3. For **PTB POS tagging**, the citation is:
   > Marcus, Mitchell P., Beatrice Santorini, and Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz. *Building a Large Annotated Corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. In Computational Linguistics, 1993.

4. For **CoNLL-2000 chunking**, the citation is:
   > Tjong Kim Sang, Erik F. T. *Introduction to the CoNLL-2000 Shared Task: Chunking*. In Proceedings of the 2000 Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL-2000), 2000.

5. For **CoNLL-2003 English NER**, the citation is:
   > Tjong Kim Sang, Erik F. T. *Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 Shared Task: Language-Independent Named Entity Recognition*. In Proceedings of the 2003 Conference on Natural Language Learning (CoNLL-2003), 2003.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing.
