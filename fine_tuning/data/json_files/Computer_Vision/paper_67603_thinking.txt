To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GenHowTo: Learning to Generate Actions and State Transformations from Instructional Videos" by Tomáš Souček et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors "automatically mine a dataset of triplets of consecutive frames," which indicates that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Learning to generate actions and state transformations)**, where the authors describe their dataset acquisition process. They mention that they built a dataset consisting of "5-tuples extracted from videos of the ChangeIt and the COIN datasets." This is a key point as it directly identifies the datasets used.

In **section 4.1 (Dataset and experimental setup)**, the authors provide further details about the datasets. They state that they selected approximately 200k tuples from the COIN and ChangeIt datasets, which consist of initial state images, action images, and final state images along with corresponding text prompts.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the following:

1. **COIN Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yansong Tang, Dajun Ding, Yongming Rao, Yu Zheng, Danyang Zhang, Lili Zhao, Jiwen Lu, and Jie Zhou. *COIN: A large-scale dataset for comprehensive instructional video analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019.

2. **ChangeIt Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Tomáš Souček, Jean-Baptiste Alayrac, Antoine Miech, Ivan Laptev, and Josef Sivic. *Look for the change: Learning object states and state-modifying actions from untrimmed web videos*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2022.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **COIN Dataset**: A large-scale dataset designed for comprehensive instructional video analysis, containing various interaction categories and corresponding video frames.

2. **ChangeIt Dataset**: A dataset focused on learning object states and state-modifying actions from untrimmed web videos, providing a diverse set of interactions.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately represented for future reference or processing.
