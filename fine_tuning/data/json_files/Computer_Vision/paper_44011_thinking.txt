To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Influence Functions in Deep Learning are Fragile" by Samyadeep Basu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted a comprehensive empirical study on datasets such as **Iris, MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet**. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention:

1. **Iris Dataset**: The authors refer to the Iris dataset as a small dataset used for initial experiments where the exact Hessian can be computed. They cite Anderson (1936) as the source of this dataset.

2. **MNIST Dataset**: The authors mention using the MNIST dataset for evaluating the accuracy of influence functions in a small CNN architecture. They reference Koh & Liang (2017) for their methodology related to this dataset.

3. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset is used for experiments with modern deep architectures. The authors cite Krizhevsky et al. (2000) as the source.

4. **ImageNet Dataset**: The authors discuss using ImageNet for scaling influence computations. They cite Deng et al. (2009) as the source for this dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Iris Dataset**:
  > Anderson, E. (1936). *Iris flower dataset*. 

- For the **MNIST Dataset**:
  > Koh, P. W., & Liang, P. (2017). Understanding black-box predictions via influence functions. In *Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)*, 70, 1885-1894.

- For the **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Nair, V., & Hinton, G. (2000). *CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*. 

- For the **ImageNet Dataset**:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database. In *CVPR09*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective sources.
