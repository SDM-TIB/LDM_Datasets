To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Thanks for Nothing: Predicting Zero-Valued Activations with Lightweight Convolutional Neural Networks" by Gil Shomron et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or utilized. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any statements that indicate the use of specific datasets for training or evaluation. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for subsections that explicitly mention datasets, their sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **CIFAR-100** and **ILSVRC-2012** datasets for their experiments. I will gather the following details for each dataset:

1. **CIFAR-100**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 100 classes, with 600 images per class. It is commonly used for evaluating machine learning algorithms.

2. **ILSVRC-2012**: This dataset is part of the ImageNet project and contains over 1.2 million images across 1,000 classes. It is widely used for image classification tasks.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **CIFAR-100**:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Nair, V., & Hinton, G. (2009). CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. Retrieved from http://www.cs.toronto.edu/ kriz/cifar.html

- For **ILSVRC-2012**:
  > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., et al. (2015). ImageNet large scale visual recognition challenge. *International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV)*, 115(3), 211â€“252.

Now that I have gathered all necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
