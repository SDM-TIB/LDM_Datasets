To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spacecraft Attitude Pointing Control under Pointing Forbidden Constraints with Guaranteed Accuracy" by Jiakun Lei et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the introduction and methodology sections, where datasets are more likely to be discussed in detail.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. These sections typically describe the datasets used for simulations or experiments. If the authors refer to any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, types of data, and any specific characteristics that are highlighted.

If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, I will examine it closely. This section may provide comprehensive information about the datasets, including their sources, how they were collected, and their relevance to the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure to extract the complete citation for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

If the datasets are derived from other studies or papers, I will make sure to cite the original sources accurately. This may involve looking up the original papers if they are not fully cited in the current paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured and can be used for further analysis or research.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper while maintaining the importance of proper citation.
