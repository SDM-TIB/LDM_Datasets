To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Universal Deep Network for Steganalysis of Color Image based on Channel Representation" by Kangkang Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **ALASKA II** dataset, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges of steganalysis for color images and reference various methods, but the key dataset is likely to be mentioned in the context of their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will confirm the details about the **ALASKA II** dataset. The authors state that they conducted extensive experiments on this dataset, which suggests it is the primary dataset used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **ALASKA II** dataset. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and understanding of the dataset's origin. The reference for the ALASKA dataset is:

- **ALASKA II Dataset**: 
  > R. Cogranne, Q. Giboulot, and P. Bas. "The ALASKA steganalysis challenge: A first step towards steganalysis." In ACM Workshop on Information Hiding and Multimedia Security, pp. 125â€“137, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation as required. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all necessary information is included and accurately represented.
