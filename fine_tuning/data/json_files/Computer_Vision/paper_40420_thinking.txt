To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Learned Collaborative Stereo Refinement" by Patrick Knöbelreiter and Thomas Pock, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to the use of **publicly available stereo benchmarks Middlebury 2014 and Kitti 2015**. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for their research.

Next, I will look closely at the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation methods. In section 6, they mention both datasets in detail:

1. **Kitti 2015 Dataset**: This dataset is specifically designed for autonomous driving and contains 200 images with ground-truth data for training and testing. The authors note that the ground-truth is captured using a laser scanner, which adds to its reliability.

2. **Middlebury 2014 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 153 high-resolution indoor images with precise dense ground-truth. The authors highlight the challenges posed by large occluded regions and difficult lighting conditions in this dataset.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **Kitti 2015 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Menze, M., & Geiger, A. (2015). *Object scene flow for autonomous vehicles*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 3061–3070.

- For the **Middlebury 2014 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Scharstein, D., Hirschmüller, H., Kitajima, Y., Krathwohl, G., Nesic, N., Wang, X., & Westling, P. (2014). *High-resolution stereo datasets with subpixel-accurate ground truth*. In German Conference on Pattern Recognition (GCPR), pp. 31–42.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
