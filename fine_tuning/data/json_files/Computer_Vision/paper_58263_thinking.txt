To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Imitating Human Behaviour with Diffusion Models" by Tim Pearce et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments in a simulated robotic control task and a modern 3D gaming environment, which suggests that datasets related to these tasks may be present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors describe their methodology and the environments used for testing. In **Section 4.1**, they detail the "Robotic Control from Human Demonstration" environment, which includes a dataset of 566 trajectories collected using a virtual reality setup. This indicates that there is a specific dataset associated with this environment.

I will extract the following datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **Kitchen Environment Dataset**: This dataset consists of 566 trajectories collected from human demonstrations in a simulated kitchen environment. The authors specify that these trajectories were translated from human movements to robot joint actuations. 

2. **Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO) Dataset**: The authors mention using a dataset containing 45,000 observation/action tuples recorded from a high-skill human player in the CSGO game environment. This dataset is crucial for evaluating the performance of their models in a gaming context.

Now, I will look for the full citations of these datasets in the **References section** of the paper. 

- For the **Kitchen Environment Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gupta, A., Kumar, V., Lynch, C., Levine, S., & Hausman, K. (2020). Relay policy learning: Solving long-horizon tasks via imitation and reinforcement learning. In Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL), pages 1025–1037. PMLR.

- For the **CSGO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pearce, T., & Zhu, J. (2022). Counter-strike deathmatch with large-scale behavioural cloning. In 2022 IEEE Conference on Games (CoG), pages 104–111. IEEE.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while adhering to the importance of proper citation.
