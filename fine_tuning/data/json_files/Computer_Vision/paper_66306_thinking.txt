To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multiple-Question Multiple-Answer Text-VQA" by Peng Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art results on multiple text-VQA datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using four datasets: **OCR-VQA**, **TextVQA**, **ST-VQA**, and **DocVQA**. I will take note of these names and look for detailed descriptions in the relevant sections.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a summary of the datasets used, including their purposes and characteristics. Here’s what I find:

1. **OCR-VQA**: This dataset is used for book/movie cover visual question answering. It contains 166K training images and is referenced as:
   > Mishra, A., Shekhar, S., Singh, A., & Chakraborty, A. (2019). *OCR-VQA: Visual Question Answering by Reading Text in Images*. In Proceedings of the 2019 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), pages 947–952.

2. **TextVQA**: This dataset is designed for scene-text visual question answering and has 21.9K training images. The citation is:
   > Singh, A., Mishra, A., & Chakraborty, A. (2019). *TextVQA: A Dataset for Text Visual Question Answering*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 8317–8326.

3. **ST-VQA**: This dataset is also for scene-text visual question answering, with 1.9K training images. The citation is:
   > Biten, A. F., Litman, R., Xie, Y., Appalaraju, S., & Manmatha, R. (2019). *Scene Text Visual Question Answering*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 4291–4301.

4. **DocVQA**: This dataset is focused on document images and contains 17K training images. The citation is:
   > Mathew, M., Karatzas, D., & Jawaheer, C. V. (2021). *DocVQA: A Dataset for VQA on Document Images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), pages 2200–2209.

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will ensure that I have the correct format for each citation, as it is crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including names, descriptions, and citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.
