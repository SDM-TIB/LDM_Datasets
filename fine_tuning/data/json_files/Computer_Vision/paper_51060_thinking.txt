To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatio-Temporal Joint Graph Convolutional Networks for Traffic Forecasting" by Chuanpan Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on "five public traffic datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will navigate to **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they list the following datasets:

1. **PeMSD3**: This dataset is collected by the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) and contains traffic flow data aggregated into 5-minute intervals. The time range for this dataset is from September 1, 2018, to November 30, 2018, with a total of 358 nodes.

2. **PeMSD4**: Similar to PeMSD3, this dataset is also from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System and includes traffic flow, average speed, and average occupancy data, aggregated into 5-minute intervals. The time range is from January 1, 2018, to February 28, 2018, with 307 nodes.

3. **PeMSD7**: This dataset contains traffic flow data collected from the same system, with a time range from May 1, 2017, to August 31, 2017, and includes 883 nodes.

4. **PeMSD8**: Another dataset from the Caltrans system, it includes traffic flow, average speed, and average occupancy data, with a time range from July 1, 2016, to August 31, 2016, and 170 nodes.

5. **Seattle-Loop**: This dataset consists of traffic speed data collected from 323 loop detectors in the Greater Seattle Area, covering the entire year of 2015, with a 5-minute resolution.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **PeMSD3**, **PeMSD4**, **PeMSD7**, and **PeMSD8**, the citation is:
  > Z. Cui, R. Ke, and Y. Wang. "Traffic graph convolutional recurrent neural network: A deep learning framework for network-scale traffic learning and forecasting." *IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems*, 2019.

- For **Seattle-Loop**, the citation is:
  > Z. Cui, K. Henrickson, R. Ke, and Y. Wang. "Deep bidirectional and unidirectional LSTM recurrent neural network for network-wide traffic speed prediction." *arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.02143*, 2018.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
