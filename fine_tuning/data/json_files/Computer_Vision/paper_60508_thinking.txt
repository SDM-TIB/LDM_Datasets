To extract datasets from the research paper titled "D2NT: A High-Performing Depth-to-Normal Translator" by Yi Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on various datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will carefully review the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using the **3F2N dataset**, which is a synthetic dataset they previously published. They also refer to other datasets like **NYUv2** and **DIODE** for comparison purposes. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their purpose and any specific characteristics mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

The citations I will look for include:

1. **3F2N Dataset**: I will find the original paper where this dataset was introduced to provide a complete citation.
2. **NYUv2 Dataset**: This dataset is commonly referenced in the literature, so I will locate its original citation.
3. **DIODE Dataset**: Similarly, I will find the citation for this dataset as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will format the extracted information in a structured manner, ready for downstream processing or review.
