To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Radio-astronomical Image Reconstruction with Conditional Denoising Diffusion Model" by M. Drozdova et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset of **10,164 images simulated with the CASA tool simalma**, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved. This will be my first dataset to document.

Next, I will look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **methods, results, and discussion sections**. In the introduction, the authors reference the **A3COSMOS dataset** as a comparison point for their simulations. This dataset is also relevant and should be included.

In the **simulated data section**, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used for training their model. They mention that the simulations are designed to match real observations from the **A3COSMOS dataset**. This confirms the relevance of the A3COSMOS dataset in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for both datasets:

1. For the **simulated dataset** (10,164 images):
   > The dataset is based on the ALMA Cycle 5.3 antenna configuration and produced using the CASA tool simalma. However, since this is a simulation, it may not have a formal citation like traditional datasets.

2. For the **A3COSMOS dataset**:
   > Liu, D., Schinnerer, E., Groves, B., Magnelli, B., et al. "Automated mining of the ALMA archive in the COSMOS field (A3COSMOS)." The Astrophysical Journal, 887(2):235, 2019. DOI: 10.3847/1538-4357/ab4c3a.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **Simulated Dataset**: 10,164 images generated using CASA simalma based on ALMA Cycle 5.3 configuration.
- **A3COSMOS Dataset**: A dataset used for comparison, which is publicly available and provides real observational data.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
