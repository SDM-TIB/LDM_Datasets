To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-scale Super-resolution Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging with Adjustable Sharpness" by Siyuan Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the experiments were conducted on a "1H-MRSI dataset from 15 high-grade glioma patients." This indicates that there is a specific dataset used in the study, which I need to explore further.

Next, I will look into the **experiments and results section** (section 3) to gather more details about the dataset. In section 3.1, the authors describe the data acquisition process, stating that they collected a unique 3D brain MRSI dataset from 15 high-grade glioma patients. They provide specifics about the imaging parameters, including the resolution and the types of metabolites analyzed. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use in the experiments.

I will also check the **methods section** (section 2) to see if there are any additional details about the dataset, such as how it was processed or any specific characteristics that might be important for understanding its application in the study.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the dataset:

1. **1H-MRSI Dataset**: This dataset consists of metabolic maps derived from 15 high-grade glioma patients. The authors mention that the dataset includes high-resolution and high-SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) images, which are crucial for the study's objectives.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since this dataset is derived from a specific patient cohort and not a publicly available dataset, it may not have a formal citation like other datasets. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper regarding the dataset's acquisition and characteristics.

The relevant citation for the study itself, which includes the dataset, is:
> Dong, S., Hangel, G., Bogner, W., Trattnig, S., Rössler, K., Widhalm, G., De Feyter, H.M., De Graaf, R.A., Duncan, J.S. (2021). High-resolution magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging using a multi-encoder attention U-Net with structural and adversarial loss. In: 2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC), pp. 2891–2895. IEEE.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information and prepare to format it according to the required structure, ensuring that I include the full citation for the study that describes the dataset.
