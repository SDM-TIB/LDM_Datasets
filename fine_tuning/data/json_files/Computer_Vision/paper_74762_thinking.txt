To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Accurate and Enriched Features for Stereo Image Super-Resolution" by Hu Gao and Depeng Dang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used for training and evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the need for datasets in stereo image super-resolution tasks, but I need to look for specific dataset names. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection labeled **Datasets**. Here, the authors detail the datasets used for training and testing their proposed method. They mention:

1. **Flickr1024 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 800 images used for training. The authors note that they perform bicubic downsampling to generate high-resolution images from this dataset.

2. **Middlebury Dataset**: This dataset contains 60 images, also used for training. The authors highlight that due to the higher spatial resolution of images in this dataset, they conduct bicubic downsampling with a scale factor of 2.

3. **KITTI 2012 Dataset**: This dataset is used for testing and consists of 20 images.

4. **KITTI 2015 Dataset**: Another testing dataset, which also includes 20 images.

5. **Flickr1024 Dataset**: Additionally mentioned again in the context of testing, with 112 images used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

- For the **Flickr1024 Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Middlebury Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. Scharstein and R. Szeliski. "High-resolution stereo datasets with subpixel-accurate ground truth." In Pattern Recognition: 36th German Conference, GCPR 2014, pp. 31–42.

- For the **KITTI 2012 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Geiger, P. Lenz, and R. Urtasun. "Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2012, pp. 3354–3361.

- For the **KITTI 2015 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Menze and A. Geiger. "Object scene flow for autonomous vehicles." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2015, pp. 3061–3070.

With these details, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
