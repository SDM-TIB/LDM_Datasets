To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Do Vision-Language Models Understand Compound Nouns?" by Sonal Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract introduces **Compun**, a benchmark created to evaluate vision-language models (VLMs) on their understanding of compound nouns (CNs). This indicates that a dataset is present.

Next, I will focus on the **section 3 (Compun Benchmark)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that **Compun** consists of 400 unique compound nouns, with each instance including one image representing the compound noun and two distractor images. This section provides essential details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

In the **data collection and annotation subsection**, the authors explain how they curated the dataset, including the sources of the compound nouns and the process of selecting images. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and reliability.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Compun dataset. The authors mention that the dataset is available on GitHub, which is a good indication of its accessibility. However, since it is a newly created benchmark, it may not have a formal citation yet. I will note that the dataset can be accessed at the provided GitHub link: https://github.com/sonalkum/Compun.

Since the Compun dataset is the primary dataset discussed in the paper, I will document it as follows:

1. **Compun Dataset**: A benchmark with 400 instances designed to evaluate VLMs' ability to interpret compound nouns. Each instance includes one image representing the compound noun and two distractor images.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset's name, description, and citation details. If the dataset does not have a formal citation yet, I will note the GitHub link as the source.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the Compun dataset, ready for further use or analysis.
