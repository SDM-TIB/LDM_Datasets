To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Characterisation of Physical Processes from Anomalous Diffusion Data" by Carlo Manzo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. The introduction provides context about the AnDi Challenge, which indicates that there is a dataset involved for benchmarking methods related to anomalous diffusion. The mention of a "reference dataset" suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methods or results sections**. In this case, the introduction mentions the AnDi Challenge and refers to a dataset used for the challenge, which is likely to be detailed further in the paper.

Upon reviewing the **References section**, I will specifically look for any citations related to datasets. The paper mentions a dataset linked to the AnDi Challenge, which is provided in the reference list. The relevant citation is:

- **AnDi Challenge Dataset**: 
  > Mu√±oz-Gil G, Manzo C, Volpe G, Garcia-March M A, Metzler R, and Lewenstein M. *The anomalous diffusion challenge: single trajectory characterisation as a competition*. Emerging Topics in Artificial Intelligence 2020 vol 11469 (International Society for Optics and Photonics) p 114691C. URL: https://github.com/AnDiChallenge/ANDI_datasets

This citation provides the necessary details about the dataset used in the AnDi Challenge, including the authors, title, publication venue, and a URL for access.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset and its citation, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or processing. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's context and its significance in the research presented in the paper.
