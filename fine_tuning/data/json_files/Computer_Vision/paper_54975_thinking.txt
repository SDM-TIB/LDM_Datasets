To extract datasets from the research paper titled "360Roam: Real-Time Indoor Roaming Using Geometry-Aware 360◦ Radiance Fields" by Huajian Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors curated a diverse dataset of 360◦ images for their experiments, which suggests that there is a specific dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges of virtual tours and the use of neural rendering. They mention the creation of a new dataset for their experiments, which is a strong indication that I need to gather details about this dataset.

In the **results section**, specifically section 6.1, the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset they collected. They mention that the dataset consists of 360◦ image sequences captured in various large-scale indoor scenes, including specific scenes like Bar, Base, Cafe, and others. They also note that they used an Insta360 camera to capture these images and that they have a total of 140 panoramas on average for each scene.

I will compile the details of the dataset as follows:

1. **360Roam Dataset**: This dataset includes 360◦ image sequences from 10 different indoor scenes. The authors describe the scenes and the method of data collection, emphasizing the diversity of environments and the use of a mobile robot for capturing images.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is newly created by the authors and not previously published, it may not have a formal citation in the references. Instead, I will note that the dataset will be released to the public, which is mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and any relevant details about its collection and intended use. I will also make a note that the dataset citation is not available yet but will be released publicly.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for downstream processing.
