To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep learning cardiac motion analysis for human survival prediction" by Ghalib A. Bello et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the study involves analyzing cardiac motion data from patients diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to patient imaging and outcomes.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods** section, as this is where the authors typically describe the data they used for their analysis. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that may summarize the data characteristics or patient demographics.

In the **results** section, I will check for any references to the number of patients, types of imaging data, and any specific metrics or outcomes that were analyzed. This will help me understand the scope of the dataset and its relevance to the study's findings.

I will also review the **discussion** section for any additional context about the datasets, including how they were collected, processed, and any limitations mentioned by the authors.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets if needed.

From my reading, I expect to find at least one dataset related to cardiac imaging and patient outcomes. I will ensure to note the following details for each dataset:
1. **Name of the dataset**: This will be the title or commonly used name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains, including the type of data (e.g., imaging, clinical outcomes) and the number of subjects.
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

After gathering all this information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for future reference.
