To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RainyScape: Unsupervised Rainy Scene Reconstruction using Decoupled Neural Rendering" by Xianqiang Lyu, Hui Liu, and Junhui Hou, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a high-quality dataset for their experiments, which suggests that there is a dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss their proposed dataset. They mention constructing a multi-view rainy scene dataset using Maya, which is a crucial detail. I will look for specific information about the dataset, such as the number of scenes, viewpoints, and any unique characteristics.

In the paper, the authors state that their dataset consists of **10 scenes**, each captured from **50 viewpoints** with a resolution of **1024 Ã— 1024 pixels**. They also mention that the dataset includes rainy images, ground truth images, depth maps, and camera parameters, which are essential details for describing the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is constructed by the authors themselves using Maya, it may not have a separate citation like other datasets. Instead, I will note that the dataset is publicly available as mentioned in the paper.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: Multi-view Rainy Scene Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset consisting of 10 scenes, each with 50 viewpoints, designed for rainy scene reconstruction tasks. It includes rainy images, ground truth images, depth maps, and camera parameters.
- **Availability**: The dataset will be publicly available.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for downstream processing, ensuring that I include the relevant details and the citation for the paper itself.

The citation for the paper is:
> Xianqiang Lyu, Hui Liu, and Junhui Hou. *RainyScape: Unsupervised Rainy Scene Reconstruction using Decoupled Neural Rendering*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2023.

With this information, I will be ready to create the dataset entry in the required format.
