To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Regional Attention Over Multi-Resolution Deep Convolutional Features for Trademark Retrieval" by Osman Tursun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on the **METU dataset**, which is a significant indicator that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Dataset and Evaluation Protocol)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they specify that the **METU trademark retrieval dataset** is the largest public dataset for trademark retrieval, containing nearly 1 million trademarks, including various types of marks. This section confirms that the METU dataset is the primary dataset utilized in their study.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the METU dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- For the **METU dataset**, the citation is:
  > Osman Tursun and Sinan Kalkan. *Metu dataset: A big dataset for benchmarking trademark retrieval*. In 2015 14th IAPR International Conference on MVA. IEEE, 2015, pp. 514â€“517.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the METU dataset and does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry includes the full citation, as it is essential for proper attribution and further research. After this, I will prepare the dataset entry for the METU dataset, ready for any required output format or further processing.
