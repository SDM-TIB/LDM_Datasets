To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Moiré Photo Restoration Using Multiresolution Convolutional Neural Networks" by Yujing Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors created a "large-scale benchmark dataset with 100,000+ image pairs" for evaluating moiré pattern removal algorithms. This suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they created. They mention that the dataset consists of **135,000 image pairs**, each containing a contaminated image with moiré patterns and its corresponding uncontaminated reference image. The reference images are sourced from the **ImageNet dataset**, specifically the validation and testing images.

In this section, the authors describe the dataset collection process, including image capture and alignment, which further confirms the dataset's significance and the methodology behind its creation.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the **ImageNet dataset** in the **References section**. The citation for the ImageNet dataset is as follows:
> Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

Additionally, since the authors created their own dataset, I will note that it is a benchmark dataset specifically for moiré pattern removal, but it does not have a separate citation since it is original work.

To summarize, I will compile the dataset information as follows:

1. **Moiré Pattern Removal Dataset**: A dataset of 135,000 image pairs, each containing a moiré contaminated image and its corresponding uncontaminated reference image. The reference images are taken from the ImageNet dataset.

2. **ImageNet Dataset**: 
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
