To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Graph Embedding with Adversarial Training Methods" by Shirui Pan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on benchmark graph datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section V) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three benchmark graph datasets: **Cora**, **Citeseer**, and **Pubmed**. I will note down the details provided about each dataset, including the number of nodes, links, and features.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide complete information for future reference.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **Cora Dataset**: 
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., et al. (2008). "Collective classification in network data." *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93.

2. **Citeseer Dataset**: 
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., et al. (2008). "Collective classification in network data." *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93.

3. **Pubmed Dataset**: 
   > Namata, G., London, B., Getoor, L., et al. (2012). "Query-driven active surveying for collective classification." In *MLG*.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset identified in the paper.
