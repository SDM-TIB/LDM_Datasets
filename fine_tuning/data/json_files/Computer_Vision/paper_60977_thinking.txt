To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TESS: Text-to-Text Self-Conditioned Simplex Diffusion" by Rabeeh Karimi Mahabadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used. In this case, the authors mention evaluating their method on various natural language understanding and generation tasks, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Tasks and Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Quota Question Pairs (QQP)**: This dataset is used for paraphrase generation and consists of 147,000 positive pairs of questions that have the same meaning.

2. **NEWSELA-AUTO**: This dataset is utilized for text simplification and contains 666,000 complex-simplified sentence pairs.

3. **QUASAR-T**: This dataset is employed for question generation and consists of 119,000 document-question pairs.

4. **CNN-DailyMail**: This dataset is used for summarization and comprises 300,000 articles and their corresponding summaries.

5. **GLUE benchmark**: This benchmark includes several datasets for classification tasks, such as SST-2, MNLI, CoLA, MRPC, QQP, QNLI, STS-B, and RTE.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations:

- **Quota Question Pairs (QQP)**:
  > Bhuwan Dhingra, Kathryn Mazaitis, and William W. Cohen. *Quasar: Datasets for question answering by search and reading*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.03904, 2017.

- **NEWSELA-AUTO**:
  > Chao Jiang, Mounica Maddela, Wuwei Lan, Yang Zhong, and Wei Xu. *Neural CRF model for sentence alignment in text simplification*. In ACL, 2020.

- **QUASAR-T**:
  > Bhuwan Dhingra, Kathryn Mazaitis, and William W. Cohen. *Quasar: Datasets for question answering by search and reading*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.03904, 2017.

- **CNN-DailyMail**:
  > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomas Kocisky, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend*. In NeurIPS, 2015.

- **GLUE benchmark**:
  > Alex Wang, Amanpreet Singh, Julian Michael, Felix Hill, Omer Levy, and Samuel R. Bowman. *GLUE: A multi-task benchmark and analysis platform for natural language understanding*. In ICLR, 2019.

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information appropriately for further use or analysis.
