To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Shake to Leak: Fine-tuning Diffusion Models Can Amplify the Generative Privacy Risk" by Zhangheng Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses privacy risks associated with diffusion models and mentions a new risk called Shake-to-Leak (S2L). However, it does not explicitly mention any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** to identify any datasets used in the experiments. In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using the **LAION-2B-en** and **LAION-HiRes-512x512** datasets for pre-training the diffusion model. This is a crucial finding as it indicates the datasets utilized for training the models discussed in the paper.

I will also look for any specific datasets used for fine-tuning or testing. The authors mention constructing a private dataset corresponding to 40 celebrities from the **CelebA** dataset, which is used to evaluate the privacy risks associated with the diffusion models. This dataset is significant for understanding the context of the experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **LAION-2B-en**:
   > Schuhmann, C., Beaumont, R., Vencu, R., Gordon, C., Wightman, R., Cherti, M., Coombes, T., Katta, C., Mullis, C., Wortsman, M., et al. (2022). *LAION-5B: An open large-scale dataset for training next generation image-text models*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35, 25 278–25 294.

2. **CelebA**:
   > Liu, Z., Liu, Y., Yang, M., Huang, H., and Zhuang, Y. (2015). *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3730–3736.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as they are critical for proper attribution and further research.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
