To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Effect of Observed Subject Biases in Apparent Personality Analysis from Audio-visual Signals" by Ricardo Darío Pérez Principi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the **ChaLearn First Impressions dataset**, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors discuss their focus on the **ChaLearn First Impressions dataset**, which consists of one-person conversational videos. This provides context about the dataset's purpose and content.

In **section 4.1 (First Impressions dataset)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset, stating that it contains **10,000 short video clips** of individuals talking to a camera, with various demographic attributes. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and usage in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ChaLearn First Impressions dataset. The citation is as follows:
> V. Ponce-López, B. Chen, M. Oliu, C. Corneanu, A. Clapés, I. Guyon, X. Baró, H. J. Escalante, and S. Escalera. "ChaLearn LAP 2016: First Round Challenge on First Impressions - Dataset and Results." In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 400–418, 2016.

Since the paper primarily focuses on this dataset, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset as it is crucial for proper referencing.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the ChaLearn First Impressions dataset, ensuring that it is ready for any further processing or review.
