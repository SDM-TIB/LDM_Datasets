To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Solving Inverse Problems by Joint Posterior Maximization with Autoencoding Prior" by Mario González, Andrés Almansa, and Pauline Tan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, but the introduction and experimental sections are more likely to contain specific references to datasets used in the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for solving inverse problems, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look further into the experimental section for concrete examples.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section**. Here, the authors describe their experiments on various inverse problems, including denoising, compressed sensing, interpolation, deblurring, and super-resolution. They mention using the **MNIST dataset** for training their VAE and conducting experiments. Additionally, they refer to the **CelebA dataset** for testing their approach on more complex images.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yann Lecun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998. doi: 10.1109/5.726791.

2. **CelebA Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), December 2015.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

- The **MNIST dataset** is used for training the VAE, which consists of handwritten digits and is widely used in machine learning for benchmarking.
- The **CelebA dataset** is utilized for testing the proposed method on more complex images, specifically for face attributes.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
