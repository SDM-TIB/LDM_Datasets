To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusive Gibbs Sampling" by Wenlin Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the challenges of sampling from multi-modal distributions and mentions various applications, but does not explicitly name any datasets. The introduction may provide more context or specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors describe their empirical evaluations across three complex multi-modal sampling tasks: a mixture of 40 Gaussians, Bayesian neural networks, and molecular dynamics. I will need to identify if any specific datasets are referenced in these contexts.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention:
1. **Mixture of 40 Gaussians**: This is a synthetic dataset used for testing the performance of their method.
2. **Bayesian Neural Networks**: The authors refer to a training dataset generated from a Gaussian prior, but do not specify a publicly available dataset.
3. **Molecular Dynamics**: They mention using the potential energy function for the 22-atom molecule alanine dipeptide, which is based on simulations from previous studies.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, it appears that the paper primarily discusses synthetic datasets and does not reference any publicly available datasets with full citations. The molecular dynamics section refers to previous works for the energy function but does not provide a specific dataset citation.

Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset citations, I will summarize the datasets as follows:
1. **Synthetic Mixture of 40 Gaussians**: No citation, as this is a generated dataset for testing.
2. **Bayesian Neural Networks**: No specific dataset mentioned; the authors generated their own training data.
3. **Molecular Dynamics of Alanine Dipeptide**: The authors reference previous studies for the energy function but do not provide a specific dataset citation.

In conclusion, while I can summarize the datasets used in the experiments, I will note that there are no formal citations for publicly available datasets in this paper. I will document this information clearly to reflect the findings accurately.
