To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-grained Appearance Transfer with Diffusion Models" by YuTeng Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments using both synthetic and real-world data, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets or data sources in these sections.

Next, I will move to the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention that they collected data from both synthetic and real-world sources. They detail the process of generating synthetic data using ChatGPT-4 and Stable Diffusion, and they also mention manually selecting 400 pairs of high-quality source and target images for evaluation. Additionally, they compiled a set of 100 real-world images with related source and target text.

I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset consists of 400 pairs of high-quality source and target images generated from text prompts using ChatGPT-4 and Stable Diffusion. The prompts cover a range of semantic relationships, from closely related concepts to those with larger gaps.

2. **Real-World Dataset**: This dataset includes 100 real-world images sourced from the internet, which also have related source and target text.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are generated and compiled by the authors themselves, they may not have formal citations like established datasets. Instead, I will note that the synthetic dataset is based on the methodologies described in the paper and the tools used (ChatGPT-4 and Stable Diffusion).

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant details and any necessary citations for the tools used to generate the datasets:

- For the synthetic dataset, I will reference:
  > OpenAI. *GPT-4 Technical Report*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.08774, 2023.

- For the Stable Diffusion model, I will reference:
  > Robin Rombach, Andreas Blattmann, Dominik Lorenz, Patrick Esser, and Björn Ommer. *High-resolution image synthesis with latent diffusion models*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 10684–10695, 2022.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
