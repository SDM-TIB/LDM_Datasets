To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3D-DETNet: a Single Stage Video-Based Vehicle Detector" by Suichan Li, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the author mentions evaluating the method on the **UA-DETRAC vehicle detection dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (specifically section 4) where the author discusses the evaluation of the proposed method. In section 4, the author explicitly states that the experiments were conducted on the **UA-DETRAC vehicle detection dataset**. This confirms that this dataset is used for evaluation.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the UA-DETRAC dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **UA-DETRAC Dataset**:
  > Wen, L., Du, D., Cai, Z., Lei, Z., Chang, M. C., Qi, H., et al. "UA-DETRAC: A new benchmark and protocol for multi-object detection and tracking." arXiv preprint arXiv: 1511.04136 (2015).

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will focus solely on the UA-DETRAC dataset for my extraction.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have a complete and accurate representation of the dataset used in the research.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the UA-DETRAC dataset, ensuring that the citation is included correctly for future reference or processing.
