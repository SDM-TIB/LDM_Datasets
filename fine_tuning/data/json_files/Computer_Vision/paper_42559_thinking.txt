To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Robust Speaker Clustering Method Based on Discrete Tied Variational Autoencoder" by Chen Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and experiments sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the speaker clustering task and mention the use of i-vectors, but they do not explicitly name any datasets. I will proceed to the **experiments section** to find specific datasets used in their evaluations.

In **section 3 (Experiment)**, the authors mention the **Voxceleb1 dataset**. They describe it as a public dataset containing 145,265 utterances from 1,251 speakers, balanced in gender and containing real noise. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, particularly for the speaker linking task.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Voxceleb1 dataset. However, the paper does not provide a direct citation for this dataset. I will need to look up the Voxceleb1 dataset independently to ensure I have the correct citation.

The full citation for the Voxceleb1 dataset is:
> A. Nagrani, J. Chung, and A. Zisserman. *VoxCeleb: a large-scale speaker identification dataset*. In Proceedings of the INTERSPEECH, 2017.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Voxceleb1 Dataset**: This dataset is used for the speaker linking task and contains 145,265 utterances from 1,251 speakers, with real-world noise included.

With this information, I can now prepare the dataset entry according to the required format, ensuring that the full citation is included for the Voxceleb1 dataset. This structured approach allows me to extract and document datasets effectively from research papers.
