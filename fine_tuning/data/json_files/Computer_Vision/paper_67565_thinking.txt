To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncertainty-aware Surrogate Models for Airfoil Flow Simulations with Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models" by Qiang Liu and Nils Thuerey, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves simulations of flows around airfoils, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **data generation and preprocessing section** (Section II), where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they generated 5000 two-dimensional simulation cases using 1417 different airfoils from the UIUC database. This is a clear indication of a dataset.

The authors specify that the training dataset includes various Reynolds numbers (Re) and angles of attack (Î±), and they also mention a test dataset generated from 30 airfoils not used in training. This section provides crucial details about the datasets, including their size and the parameters involved.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the UIUC Airfoil Coordinates Database, which is essential for understanding the source of the airfoil data used in the simulations.

The citation for the UIUC Airfoil Coordinates Database is:
> Group, U. A. A. "UIUC Airfoil Coordinates Database." Available at: https://m-selig.ae.illinois.edu/ads/coord_database.html, 2023.

Additionally, the paper mentions that the simulations were performed using the open-source code OpenFOAM, which is relevant for understanding the computational framework used for the dataset generation.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. The datasets identified are:

1. **Training Dataset**: 5000 two-dimensional simulation cases generated from 1417 different airfoils.
2. **Test Dataset**: 130 simulation cases generated from 30 airfoils not used in the training dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each entry includes the necessary details and citations.
