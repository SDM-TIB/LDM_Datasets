To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Nonlinear Intensity Underwater Sonar Image Matching Method Based on Phase Information and Deep Convolution Features" by Xiaoteng Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setting sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not contain specific dataset names. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methodology sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of sonar image matching due to nonlinear intensity differences but do not explicitly mention any datasets. I will then move to the **methodology section**, where they describe their approach in detail. Here, they mention using sonar images captured by AUVs, but I need to find specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experimental setting section**. The authors state that they selected a group of SSS images with nonlinear intensity caused by the heading of AUV turning 180 degrees. They also mention that the SSS images were obtained from Deep Vision AB using the DeepEye 680D in Lake VÃ¤ttern, Sweden. This indicates that the dataset is related to sonar images collected in a specific location.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the source of the sonar images, which is crucial for proper citation.

The citation for the dataset used in the experiments is:
- For the sonar images obtained from Deep Vision AB:
  > Deep Vision AB company. Available online: http://deepvision.se/ (accessed on 26 November 2021).

Since the paper does not mention any other specific datasets or provide additional citations, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

I will create an entry for the dataset using the required format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset as it is critical for proper referencing. After compiling the dataset entry, I will prepare it for review or further processing.
