To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graphical Generative Adversarial Networks" by Chongxuan Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors present two instances of Graphical-GAN: **Gaussian Mixture GAN (GMGAN)** and **State Space GAN (SSGAN)**, which are applied to visual datasets. This indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the experiments section, the authors state that they evaluate GMGAN on the **MNIST**, **SVHN**, **CIFAR10**, and **CelebA** datasets, and SSGAN on the **Moving MNIST** and **3D chairs** datasets. This gives me a clear list of datasets used for evaluation.

Now, I will gather more information about each dataset by checking the **experimental details** section, where the authors provide descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of handwritten digits of size 28×28, with 50,000 training samples, 10,000 validation samples, and 10,000 testing samples.

2. **SVHN Dataset**: This dataset consists of digit sequences of size 32×32, with 73,257 training samples and 26,032 testing samples.

3. **CIFAR10 Dataset**: This dataset consists of natural images of size 32×32, with 50,000 training samples and 10,000 testing samples.

4. **CelebA Dataset**: This dataset consists of 202,599 face images, with 5,000 samples randomly selected for testing.

5. **Moving MNIST Dataset**: This dataset contains sequences of handwritten digits that bounce inside a 64×64 patch, with clips generated of lengths 4 and 16.

6. **3D Chairs Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,786 sequences of rendered chairs, each sequence having a length of 31.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
