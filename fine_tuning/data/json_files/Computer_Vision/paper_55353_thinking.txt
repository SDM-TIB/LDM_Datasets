To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Personalized Recommendations in EdTech: Evidence from a Randomized Controlled Trial" by Keshav Agrawal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on personalized content recommendations, which suggests that there may be datasets related to user interactions with the educational app.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources. The introduction discusses the context of the study and the importance of empirical evidence in educational settings, which may lead to mentions of specific datasets used for analysis.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the data collection process, including any datasets used in the randomized controlled trial. This section is likely to contain specific information about the user interaction logs, the structure of the data, and any relevant metrics defined for analysis.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors reference any datasets when discussing their findings. This may include summaries of user engagement metrics or comparisons between treatment and control groups.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the study.

Based on my reading, I anticipate that the following datasets will be relevant:

1. **User Interaction Logs**: This dataset likely contains records of user interactions with the Freadom app, including metrics such as story engagement, completion rates, and user demographics.

2. **Historical Data for Model Training**: This dataset may include past user interactions that were used to train the recommendation system, detailing how users engaged with stories over time.

3. **Randomized Controlled Trial Data**: This dataset will include the results of the randomized experiment, detailing the treatment and control groups, user engagement metrics, and any statistical analyses performed.

Once I have gathered all necessary information, I will compile the full citations for each dataset, ensuring that they are accurately represented according to the conventions used in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
