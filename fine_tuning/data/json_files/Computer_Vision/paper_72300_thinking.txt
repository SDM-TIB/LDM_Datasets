To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WangLab at MEDIQA-M3G 2024: Multimodal Medical Answer Generation using Large Language Models" by Ronald Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and shared task sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a submission to the MEDIQA2024 Multilingual and Multimodal Medical Answer Generation shared task, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Shared task and provided dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for the MEDIQA-M3G competition. They mention that the dataset consists of **842 training cases, 56 validation cases, and 100 test cases**, each containing images of skin conditions and accompanying query text. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's structure and purpose.

The authors also mention that the dataset includes **multiple responses from medical professionals**, which are used as targets for scoring model predictions. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's application in the context of the research.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as part of the MEDIQA-M3G shared task, which is detailed in the following citation:

- For the MEDIQA-M3G dataset, the citation is:
  > Wen wai Yim, Asma Ben Abacha, Velvin Fu, Zhaoyi Sun, Fei Xia, Meliha Yetisgen, and Martin Krallinger. *Overview of the MEDIQA-M3G 2024 shared task on multilingual and multimodal medical answer generation*. In Proceedings of the 6th Clinical Natural Language Processing Workshop, Mexico City, Mexico. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2024.

Additionally, the authors mention another dataset, **DermavQA**, which is referenced in the paper. The citation for this dataset is:
- For the DermavQA dataset, the citation is:
  > Wen wai Yim, Velvin Fu, Zhaoyi Sun, Asma Ben Abacha, Meliha Yetisgen, and Fei Xia. *DermavQA: A multilingual visual question answering dataset for dermatology*. CoRR, 2024.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for structured output.
