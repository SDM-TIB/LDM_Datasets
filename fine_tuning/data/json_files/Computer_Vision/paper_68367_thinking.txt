To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variability of morphology in beat-to-beat photoplethysmographic waveform quantified with unsupervised wave-shape manifold learning for clinical assessment" by Yu-Chieh Ho et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on photoplethysmography (PPG) waveform variability, which suggests that clinical data may be involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the significance of beat-to-beat variability in arterial blood pressure (ABP) and PPG waveforms, indicating that they likely used clinical datasets for their analysis. I will look for specific mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly **section 2.1**, where the authors describe the data collection process. They mention that the PPG waveform dataset was collected from a single-center prospective observational study involving 85 living donor liver recipients at Taipei Veterans General Hospital. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

The authors also reference the Institutional Review Board approval and informed consent, which adds credibility to the dataset's ethical collection. I will note the specifics of this dataset, including the number of cases and the type of data collected (PPG, ABP, central venous pressure, and electrocardiogram).

In the **results section**, the authors present findings related to the variability of morphology in the PPG waveform, which further confirms the use of the dataset for analysis. However, they do not mention additional datasets, so I will focus on the one identified.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset mentioned:

- For the PPG waveform dataset, the citation is:
  > Yu-Chieh Ho, Te-Sheng Lin, She-Chih Wang, Chen-Shi Chang, Yu-Ting Lin. *Variability of morphology in beat-to-beat photoplethysmographic waveform quantified with unsupervised wave-shape manifold learning for clinical assessment*. Preprint submitted to IOPscienceâ€“Physiological Measurement, November 26, 2023.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset information in a structured format, ensuring that the citation is included for reference. This will allow for proper acknowledgment of the dataset used in the research.
