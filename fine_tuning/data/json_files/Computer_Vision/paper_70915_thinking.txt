To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Consistency Model is an Effective Posterior Sample Approximation for Diffusion Inverse Solvers" by Tongda Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments, which suggests that datasets are likely involved. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention using the **LSUN Bedroom** and **LSUN Cat** datasets, specifying that they used the first 1000 images from each dataset for testing. This is a clear indication that these datasets are integral to their research.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the LSUN datasets are as follows:

- For **LSUN Bedroom** dataset:
  > Yu, F., Zhang, Y., Song, S., Seff, A., & Xiao, J. (2015). *LSUN: Construction of a large-scale image dataset using deep learning with humans in the loop*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.03365.

- For **LSUN Cat** dataset:
  > Yu, F., Zhang, Y., Song, S., Seff, A., & Xiao, J. (2015). *LSUN: Construction of a large-scale image dataset using deep learning with humans in the loop*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.03365.

Since both datasets are part of the same publication, I will note that they share the same citation.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
