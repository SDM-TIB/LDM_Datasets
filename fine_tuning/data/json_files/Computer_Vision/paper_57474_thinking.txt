To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Contrast for Unsupervised Skeleton-based Action Representation Learning" by Jianfeng Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that extensive experiments were conducted on four datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details of these datasets.

Next, I will navigate to **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention four datasets:

1. **NTU-60**: This dataset consists of 56,880 video samples across 60 action categories, captured from 40 different subjects. The authors describe the evaluation protocols, which include cross-subject and cross-view methods.

2. **NTU-120**: An extension of NTU-60, this dataset includes 120 action categories and 113,945 samples, performed by 106 subjects. The evaluation protocols are similar to those of NTU-60.

3. **PKU-MMD I**: This dataset is designed for human activity detection and contains 20,000 action samples across 51 action categories. It is noted as the easier version of the PKU-MMD datasets.

4. **PKU-MMD II**: The second version of the PKU-MMD dataset, which is more challenging due to larger view variations, containing 7,000 action samples.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
