To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generation Meets Recommendation: Proposing Novel Items for Groups of Users" by Thanh Vinh Vo and Harold Soh, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. In the abstract, the authors reference their evaluation on a **synthetic dataset** and two real-world datasets: the **MART dataset** and the **Movielens Tag Genome dataset**. This indicates that there are at least three datasets to consider.

Next, I will check the **introduction** for any additional context or details about these datasets. The introduction mentions the use of the MART dataset for generating abstract art and the Movielens Tag Genome dataset for generating movie genomes. This confirms their relevance to the study.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for specific details about how these datasets were utilized. The authors describe the MART dataset as comprising 500 art pieces and 10,000 ratings, while the Movielens Tag Genome dataset is noted to contain 3952 movies, 6040 users, and 1 million ratings. This provides a clearer picture of the datasets' characteristics.

I will also check the **results section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors provide further insights into the datasets' usage. The results section primarily discusses the outcomes of using the MART and Movielens datasets, reinforcing their significance in the experiments.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

1. **MART dataset**:
   > Yanulevskaya, V., Uijlings, J., Bruni, E., Sartori, A., Zamboni, E., Bacci, F., Melcher, D., & Sebe, N. (2012). *In the eye of the beholder: Employing statistical analysis and eye tracking for analyzing abstract paintings*. In Proceedings of the 20th ACM International Conference on Multimedia (MM '12), 349-358. ACM.

2. **Movielens Tag Genome dataset**:
   > Vig, J., Sen, S., & Riedl, J. (2012). *The tag genome: Encoding community knowledge to support novel interaction*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS), 2(3), 13.

3. **Synthetic dataset**: Since the synthetic dataset is generated for the purpose of the study, it may not have a formal citation. I will note that it is a constructed dataset used for evaluation.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
