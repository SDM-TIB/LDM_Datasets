To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VCP-CLIP: A visual context prompting model for zero-shot anomaly segmentation" by Zhen Qu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on **10 real-world industrial anomaly segmentation datasets**. This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the provided text, the authors list the datasets used for evaluation, which include:

1. **MVTec-AD**: A comprehensive dataset for unsupervised anomaly detection, containing 5,354 color images across 15 product categories with pixel-level annotations.
2. **VisA**: This dataset consists of 10,821 color images used for industrial anomaly detection, containing 12 product categories with pixel-level annotations.
3. **BSD**: A dataset with 1,104 images showing areas with and without pitting, specifically focusing on defective images for evaluation.
4. **GC**: A surface defect dataset with 3,570 grayscale images collected from real industry settings, annotated with bounding boxes.
5. **KSDD2**: This dataset includes 2,085 negative and 246 positive samples for training, with fine-grained segmentation masks for defects.
6. **MSD**: A mobile phone screen surface defect dataset with 1,200 images, pixel-level labeled.
7. **Road**: A dataset of 118 images depicting urban road surface conditions, with hand-labeled ground truth contours.
8. **RSDD**: Contains two style datasets from railway images, with at least one defect in each image.
9. **BTech**: An anomaly detection dataset consisting of three sub-datasets with varying resolutions and numbers of training images.
10. **DAGM**: A manually generated texture dataset with 10 classes and weakly supervised annotations.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
