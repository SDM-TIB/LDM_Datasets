To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GP CaKe: Effective brain connectivity with causal kernels" by Luca Ambrogioni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the application of the GP CaKe method on **magnetoencephalography (MEG) data**, which indicates that there is at least one dataset involved. I will note this down as a potential dataset.

Next, I will look into the **methods** and **experiments** sections, specifically focusing on any subsections that discuss data collection or datasets used for validation. In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their application of the GP CaKe method on MEG data collected from participants watching video clips. This suggests that the MEG data is a key dataset used in their analysis.

I will also check the **results** section to see if there are any specific details about the dataset, such as the number of participants, the nature of the recordings, or any preprocessing steps that were taken. The paper mentions that the MEG data was recorded using a 275-channel axial MEG system, and that independent component analysis (ICA) was applied to extract dynamic components from the recordings. This provides context for the dataset but does not specify a formal dataset name.

Next, I will consult the **references section** to identify any cited datasets. The authors reference previous works that may have used similar datasets or methodologies, but they do not provide a specific citation for the MEG dataset they collected. Therefore, I will need to create a citation based on the context provided in the paper.

Since the MEG data is a primary dataset used in their experiments, I will summarize it as follows:

1. **MEG Dataset**: This dataset consists of brain activity recordings from participants while they watched video clips. The recordings were made using a 275-channel axial MEG system, and the data was processed using independent component analysis to isolate dynamic neural sources.

Now, I will create a full citation for the MEG dataset based on the information provided in the paper. Since the authors do not provide a specific citation for the dataset, I will reference the paper itself as the source of the dataset:

- For the **MEG Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ambrogioni, L., Hinne, M., van Gerven, M., & Maris, E. (2023). GP CaKe: Effective brain connectivity with causal kernels. *arXiv preprint arXiv:XXXX.XXXX*.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that all relevant information is captured for future reference or analysis.
