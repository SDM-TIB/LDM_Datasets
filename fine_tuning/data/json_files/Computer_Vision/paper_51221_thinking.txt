To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MoFaNeRF: Morphable Facial Neural Radiance Field" by Yiyu Zhuang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their model on two large-scale 3D face datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors mention the two datasets used for training their model: **FaceScape** and **HeadSpace**. This section provides a brief overview of the datasets, but I need to find more detailed descriptions.

I will then examine **section 3 (Morphable Facial NeRF)**, where the authors elaborate on the datasets. They state that **FaceScape** contains 359 available faces with 20 expressions each, while **HeadSpace** consists of 1004 faces in a neutral expression. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope and purpose.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper. Here, I will find the following citations:

- For **FaceScape**, the citation is:
  > Yang, H., Zhu, H., Wang, Y., Huang, M., Shen, Q., Yang, R., & Cao, X. (2020). *Facescape: A large-scale high quality 3D face dataset and detailed riggable 3D face prediction*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

- For **HeadSpace**, the citation is:
  > Zhu, H., Yang, H., Guo, L., Zhang, Y., Wang, Y., Huang, M., Shen, Q., Yang, R., & Cao, X. (2021). *Facescape: 3D facial dataset and benchmark for single-view 3D face reconstruction*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.01082.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
