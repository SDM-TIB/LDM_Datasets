To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Feature Relevance Uncertainty: A Monte Carlo Dropout Sampling Approach" by Kai Fabi and Jonas Schneider, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of a method for estimating feature relevance uncertainty but does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** more closely, as this is where datasets are typically described. In this paper, the authors mention that they applied their method to an image classification task using the **ImageNet dataset**. This is a well-known dataset in the field of computer vision, and it is crucial to note its significance in the experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **ImageNet Dataset**:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248â€“255. IEEE, 2009.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the methodology and does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the **ImageNet dataset** is the only dataset used in the experiments.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the ImageNet dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. 

After completing this process, I will have a clear and structured entry for the dataset that can be used for further analysis or processing.
