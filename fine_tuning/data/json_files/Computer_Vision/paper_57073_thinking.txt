To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SPARF: Neural Radiance Fields from Sparse and Noisy Poses" by Prune Truong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their approach on "multiple challenging datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they specifically mention three datasets: **DTU**, **LLFF**, and **Replica**. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics.

1. **DTU Dataset**: The authors state that DTU is composed of complex object-level scenes with wide-baseline views. They adhere to a specific evaluation protocol and mention that they evaluate on a reported test split of 15 scenes.

2. **LLFF Dataset**: The paper describes LLFF as consisting of forward-facing scenes, where every 8th image is used as the test set. The authors also mention that they sample training views evenly from the remaining images.

3. **Replica Dataset**: The authors explain that the Replica dataset features videos of indoor room-scale scenes, and they describe their method for creating a sparse-view scenario by subsampling frames.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are as follows:

- **DTU Dataset**:

Strasdat, Renzo De Nardi, Michael Goesele, Steven Lovegrove, and Richard A. Newcombe. *The replica dataset: A digital replica of indoor spaces*. CoRR, abs/1906.05797, 2019.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced by others in the field.
