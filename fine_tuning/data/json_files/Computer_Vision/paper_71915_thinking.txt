To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Voice Attribute Editing with Text Prompt" by Zhengyan Sheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the **VCTK-RVA dataset**, which is established for manual annotations detailing voice characteristic differences among speakers. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (VCTK-RVA Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they describe how the dataset was constructed, including the involvement of speech experts and the specific characteristics of the data collected. The section outlines the process of annotating voice attributes and the number of speakers involved.

In section 3.2, the authors mention that the VCTK-RVA dataset is based on the **VCTK corpus**. They provide details about the original VCTK dataset, which consists of speech sentences from 110 speakers. This is crucial as it gives context to the VCTK-RVA dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citations for both datasets mentioned:

1. **VCTK-RVA Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is derived from the VCTK corpus. Therefore, I will cite it as follows:
   > Zhengyan Sheng, Yang Ai, Li-Juan Liu, Jia Pan, and Zhen-Hua Ling. *Voice Attribute Editing with Text Prompt*. In Proceedings of the 31st ACM International Conference on Multimedia, MM 2023, Ottawa, ON, Canada, 29 October 2023-3 November 2023, pages 8443â€“8452. ACM.

2. **VCTK Corpus**: The citation for the original VCTK dataset is:
   > Christophe Veaux, Junichi Yamagishi, and Kirsten MacDonald. *CSTR VCTK Corpus: English Multi-Speaker Corpus for CSTR Voice Cloning Toolkit*. 2023.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a single output that is ready for review or further processing.
