To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Camera Relocalization in Shadow-free Neural Radiance Fields" by Shiyao Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on several datasets with varying lighting conditions, which indicates that datasets are indeed present. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** (Section V), where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used in their evaluations. Here, I find that they mention two datasets:

1. **Shadow Urban Minimum Altitude Dataset (SUMAD)**: This dataset is created using the AirSim simulator built on Unreal Engine. It includes various lighting conditions to replicate real-world shadowing scenarios, specifically designed for urban environments resembling New York and San Francisco.

2. **NeRF-OSR Dataset**: This is a public dataset that contains real-world data captures under different lighting conditions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The SUMAD dataset is described as a new dataset created by the authors, so it may not have a formal citation yet. However, I will note its details as provided in the paper. The NeRF-OSR dataset is referenced, and I will look for its citation in the references.

Upon reviewing the references, I find the citation for the NeRF-OSR dataset:

- For **NeRF-OSR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > V. Rudnev, M. Elgharib, W. Smith, L. Liu, V. Golyanik, and C. Theobalt. *NeRF for Outdoor Scene Relighting*. 2022. (visited on 10/25/2022).

Since the SUMAD dataset is newly proposed and does not have a citation in the references, I will document it based on the information provided in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the NeRF-OSR dataset and a description for the SUMAD dataset, ready for structured output or further processing.
