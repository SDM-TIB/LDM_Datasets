To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FedMEKT: Distillation-based Embedding Knowledge Transfer for Multimodal Federated Learning" by Huy Q. Le et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on three multimodal human activity recognition datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors provide details about the datasets in **section 4.1.1 (Datasets)**. Here, they explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **mHealth Dataset**: This dataset consists of on-body sensor records from 10 participants performing 13 daily living and exercise activities. The modalities included are accelerometer (Acce), gyroscope (Gyro), and magnetometer (Mage).

2. **UR Fall Detection Dataset**: This dataset contains 70 video clips of human activities with 3 classes. The modalities used in the experiments are RGB camera (RGB), depth camera (Depth), and sensory data from accelerometers (Acce).

3. **Opportunity Dataset**: This dataset consists of on-body sensor records from 4 participants performing kitchen activities. The modalities considered are accelerometers (Acce) and gyroscopes (Gyro).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **mHealth Dataset**:
  > Banos, O., Garcia, R., Holgado-Terriza, J.A., Damas, M., Pomares, H., Rojas, I., Saez, A., Villalonga, C. (2014). *mhealthdroid: a novel framework for agile development of mobile health applications*. In International workshop on ambient assisted living, Springer, pp. 91–98.

- For the **UR Fall Detection Dataset**:
  > Kwolek, B., Kepski, M. (2014). *Human fall detection on embedded platform using depth maps and wireless accelerometer*. Computer methods and programs in biomedicine, 117, 489–501.

- For the **Opportunity Dataset**:
  > Chavarriaga, R., Sagha, H., Calatroni, A., Digumarti, S.T., Tröster, G., Millán, J.d.R., Roggen, D. (2013). *The opportunity challenge: A benchmark database for on-body sensor-based activity recognition*. Pattern Recognition Letters, 34, 2033–2042.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
