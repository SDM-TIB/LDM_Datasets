To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Soft-Constrained Schrödinger Bridge: A Stochastic Control Approach" by Jhanvi Garg et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of the **MNIST dataset** for a numerical example, which indicates that this dataset is likely to be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their application of the proposed method. In this section, they specifically mention the **MNIST dataset** as part of their experimental setup. They describe how they used a small set of noisy images of the digit '8' as the target dataset (Dobj) and a larger set of images of other digits as the reference dataset (Dref).

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper. In this case, the authors primarily focus on the MNIST dataset, so I will ensure to capture all relevant details about it.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is widely known, but it is important to provide the correct citation as per the paper's context. The citation for the MNIST dataset is:

- **MNIST Dataset**: 
  > Li Deng. *The MNIST database of handwritten digit images for machine learning research*. IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 29(6):141–142, 2012.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details as follows:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of images of handwritten digits, specifically used in the experiments to generate new images of the digit '8'. The dataset includes a total of 70,000 images, with 60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
