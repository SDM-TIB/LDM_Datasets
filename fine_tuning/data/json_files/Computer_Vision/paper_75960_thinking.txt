To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Intent-guided Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation" by Lei Sang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that empirical evaluations were conducted across **six distinct datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the provided text, there is a **Table I** that summarizes the statistics of the datasets used in the experiments. This table lists the datasets along with the number of users, items, interactions, and meta-paths.

The datasets mentioned in Table I are:

1. **Last.fm**: 
   - User Count: 1,892
   - Item Count: 17,632
   - Interaction Count: 92,834
   - Meta-paths: UU, UATAU, AA, ATA

2. **Amazon**: 
   - User Count: 6,170
   - Item Count: 2,753
   - Interaction Count: 195,791
   - Meta-paths: UIU, UIBIU, IBI, ICI

3. **Yelp**: 
   - User Count: 16,239
   - Item Count: 14,284
   - Interaction Count: 198,397
   - Meta-paths: UU, UBU, BCiB, BCaB

4. **Douban Book**: 
   - User Count: 13,024
   - Item Count: 22,347
   - Interaction Count: 792,062
   - Meta-paths: UU, UGU, BAB, BYB

5. **Movielens-1M**: 
   - User Count: 6,040
   - Item Count: 3,952
   - Interaction Count: 1,000,209
   - Meta-paths: UMU, UOU, MUM, MGM

6. **Douban Movie**: 
   - User Count: 13,367
   - Item Count: 12,677
   - Interaction Count: 1,068,278
   - Meta-paths: UU, UGU, MAM, MDM

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations typically include the authors, title, conference/journal name, and publication year.

For example, the citation for the **Last.fm dataset** might look like:
> Last.fm Dataset. *Last.fm Dataset*. Available at: [https://www.last.fm/](https://www.last.fm/).

I will do the same for the other datasets, ensuring I provide the correct and complete citations.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
