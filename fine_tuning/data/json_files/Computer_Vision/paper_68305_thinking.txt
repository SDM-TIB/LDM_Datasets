To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SDIF-DA: A Shallow-to-Deep Interaction Framework with Data Augmentation for Multi-Modal Intent Detection" by Shijue Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of multi-modal intent detection and mentions a public tri-modal intent detection benchmark called **MIntRec**. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors reference the MIntRec dataset, which includes text, video, and audio modalities, as a benchmark for their experiments. This is a crucial point as it confirms the dataset's relevance to their research.

In the **experiments section**, particularly in **section 4.2**, the authors state that they conducted experiments on the MIntRec dataset. They also mention that they generated 25,000 augmented data samples using a ChatGPT-based data augmentation approach, which is important for understanding the dataset's size and the augmentation process.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MIntRec dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **MIntRec**, the citation is:
  > Hanlei Zhang, Hua Xu, Xin Wang, Qianrui Zhou, Shaojie Zhao, and Jiayan Teng. *Mintrec: A new dataset for multimodal intent recognition*. In Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on Multimedia (MM), pages 1688â€“1697, 2022.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will focus solely on the MIntRec dataset for my final output.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
