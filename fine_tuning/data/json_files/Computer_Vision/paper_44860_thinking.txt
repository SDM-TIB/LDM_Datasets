To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpreting Deep Glucose Predictive Models for Diabetic People Using RETAIN" by Maxime De Bois et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study evaluates the RETAIN model on a real-world type-2 diabetic population, suggesting that a dataset is involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges faced by diabetic individuals and mention the use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices. However, I need to find specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly **section 3.1 (Experimental Data)**, where the authors explicitly mention the use of the **IDIAB dataset**. They describe it as containing data from 5 type-2 diabetic patients, including glucose levels recorded through the FreeStyle Libre device and manually reported carbohydrate intakes and insulin infusions.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the IDIAB dataset. The authors acknowledge the diabetes health network Revesdiab and Dr. Sylvie Joannidis for their help in building the IDIAB dataset, but they do not provide a formal citation in the references. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is acknowledged but lacks a formal citation.

Additionally, the authors mention plans to extend their study to another dataset, the **Ohio T1DM dataset**, in the conclusion. I will look for its citation in the references as well.

The citation for the **Ohio T1DM dataset** is:
> Marling, C., & Bunescu, R. (2018). The Ohio T1DM dataset for blood glucose level prediction. In The 3rd International Workshop on Knowledge Discovery in Healthcare Data, Stockholm, Sweden.

Now, I will summarize the findings:

1. **IDIAB Dataset**: Data from 5 type-2 diabetic patients, including glucose levels, carbohydrate intakes, and insulin infusions. However, no formal citation is provided in the references.
   
2. **Ohio T1DM Dataset**: A dataset for blood glucose level prediction, with the citation provided above.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
