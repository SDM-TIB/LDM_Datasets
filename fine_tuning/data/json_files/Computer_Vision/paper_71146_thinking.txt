To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Segment Anything Model for Road Network Graph Extraction" by Congrui Hetang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method is evaluated on two widely recognized satellite mapping datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **City-scale Dataset**: This dataset includes 180 satellite images of 20 U.S. cities, each image having a resolution of 2048 × 2048 pixels, with 29 images designated for testing.

2. **SpaceNet Dataset**: This dataset contains 2549 images of 400 × 400 pixels from various cities around the world, including Shanghai and Las Vegas, with 382 images set aside for testing.

Both datasets are noted to have a resolution of 1 meter/pixel and provide ground-truth vector graphs of the road network, which is crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **City-scale Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Songtao He, Favyen Bastani, Satvat Jagwani, Mohammad Alizadeh, H. Balakrishnan, Sanjay Chawla, Mohamed Mokhtar Elshrif, Samuel Madden, and Mohammad Amin Sadeghi. *Sat2graph: Road graph extraction through graph-tensor encoding*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, 2020.

- For the **SpaceNet Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Adam Van Etten, Dave Lindenbaum, and Todd M. Bacastow. *Spacenet: A remote sensing dataset and challenge series*. 2019.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
