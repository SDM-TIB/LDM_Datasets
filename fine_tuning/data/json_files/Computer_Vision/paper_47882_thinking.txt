To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Regional Total Electron Content Map Generation based on Compressive Sensing" by Cansu Sunu and Cenk Toker, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their technique using actual measurements from the **Turkish National Permanent GPS Network (TNPGN) Active**, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific details about the datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. In the paper, the authors mention using **synthetically generated TEC maps** and actual measurements from the TNPGN network. The synthetic maps are described in terms of their mathematical representations, which are not datasets in the traditional sense but rather generated data for testing purposes.

In the **performance evaluation section**, the authors provide insights into the actual measurements taken from the TNPGN network. They mention that the network consists of **146 fixed GPS reference stations** and that they used RINEX measurements to calculate TEC estimates. This indicates that the TNPGN dataset is crucial for their analysis.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the TNPGN dataset from the references section. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the TNPGN dataset itself, but it is referenced in the context of other works. Therefore, I will note that the TNPGN is a dataset derived from the following source:

- For the **Turkish National Permanent GPS Network (TNPGN) Active**, the citation is:
  > Turkish National Permanent GPS Network (TNPGN) Active. Available at: [https://www.tnpgs.gov.tr](https://www.tnpgs.gov.tr).

Additionally, the authors refer to the **IONOLAB-TEC algorithm** for estimating TEC values, which is based on the TNPGN measurements. I will include this as a relevant method used with the dataset.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the TNPGN dataset, which is used for generating TEC maps. I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
