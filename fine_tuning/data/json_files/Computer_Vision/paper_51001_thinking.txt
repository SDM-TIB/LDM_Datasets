To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pricing cryptocurrencies: Modelling the ETHBTC spot-quotient variation as a diffusion process" by Sidharth Mallik, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, data description, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the research is based on four years of data obtained from Binance, which suggests that there is a specific dataset being utilized.

Next, I will focus on the **Data Description section**, where the author states that the data has been obtained directly from the Binance exchange, covering the period from September 1st, 2017, to August 31st, 2021. The data is sampled at 1-minute intervals, resulting in over 2 million data points. This section provides a clear indication of the dataset used for the analysis.

I will also look for any specific references to datasets in the **Acknowledgements** or **References sections**. However, in this case, the author acknowledges the use of data provided by Binance but does not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself.

Since the dataset is derived from Binance, I will note that the citation for the data source is as follows:
- **Binance Data**: Binance. *Cryptocurrency Market Data*. Available at: https://www.binance.com (Accessed: [insert access date]).

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Binance Cryptocurrency Data**: This dataset includes intraday price data for ETHBTC, ETHUSDT, and BTCUSDT from September 1, 2017, to August 31, 2021, sampled at 1-minute intervals, totaling over 2 million data points.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. The key points include the dataset name, description, and the citation for the data source.
