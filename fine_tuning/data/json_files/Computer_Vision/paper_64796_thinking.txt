To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Object Motion Guided Human Motion Synthesis" by Jiaman Li, Jiajun Wu, and C. Karen Liu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the collection of a "large-scale dataset consisting of 3D object geometry, object motion, and human motion," which indicates that a dataset is indeed present. The introduction further emphasizes the need for high-quality datasets for human-object interaction, suggesting that the authors have created a new dataset for this purpose.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about their dataset. Here, they describe the dataset as containing 3D object geometry, human motion, and object motion, specifically mentioning that it includes interactions with 15 different objects and has a total duration of approximately 10 hours. This section is crucial as it provides the specifics of the dataset.

In this section, the authors also describe the methodology for collecting the dataset, including the use of a Vicon motion capture system and the involvement of 17 subjects. They mention that the dataset can be used for various tasks related to modeling full-body human manipulation behaviors.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for their dataset in the traditional sense, as it is a new dataset they have created. However, they reference the tools and methods used to create the dataset, such as Luma AI for 3D reconstruction and the Vicon system for motion capture.

Since the dataset is original and created by the authors, I will formulate a citation for it based on the information provided in the paper. The citation will include the authors, title, and a brief description of the dataset.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> Jiaman Li, Jiajun Wu, and C. Karen Liu. *Object Motion Guided Human Motion Synthesis Dataset*. 2023. This dataset consists of 3D object geometry, object motion, and human motion for 15 objects, totaling approximately 10 hours of interaction data.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets presented in the research paper.
