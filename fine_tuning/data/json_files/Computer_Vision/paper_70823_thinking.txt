To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BAD-Gaussians: Bundle Adjusted Deblur Gaussian Splatting" by Lingzhe Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method using both synthetic and real datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In section 4.1, the authors mention that they evaluate their method using datasets provided by **Deblur-NeRF** and **BAD-NeRF**. They specifically refer to the datasets used for their experiments, which include:

1. **Deblur-NeRF Dataset**: This dataset contains five scenes where blurred images are generated via Blender by averaging sharp virtual images captured during exposure time. The authors note that this dataset is used to evaluate their method's performance on synthetic data.

2. **BAD-NeRF Dataset**: This dataset expands upon the number of virtual sharp images to create more realistic motion-blurred images while keeping other settings consistent with Deblur-NeRF. It is also used for evaluating the performance of their method.

Additionally, the authors mention using a dataset tailored for motion blur-aware visual odometry, referred to as **MBA-VO**. This dataset is based on real camera motion trajectories obtained from the ETH3D dataset, which adds another layer of complexity to their evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **Deblur-NeRF Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **BAD-NeRF Dataset**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
