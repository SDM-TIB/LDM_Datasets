To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast and Robust Non-Rigid Registration Using Accelerated Majorization-Minimization" by Yuxin Yao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses non-rigid 3D registration and mentions "extensive experiments," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. I will pay close attention to any subsections that might be dedicated to datasets or experimental setups. In this paper, the authors refer to several datasets used for their experiments, including:

1. **Crane Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of evaluating the proposed method's performance. It is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the non-rigid registration approach.

2. **March2 Dataset**: Another dataset mentioned for testing the method, particularly in scenarios involving partial overlaps.

3. **Samba Dataset**: This dataset is also used for comparison in the experiments, showcasing the method's robustness in various conditions.

4. **MPI Faust Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for evaluating the method's performance on real-world data, specifically for human motion capture.

5. **Jumping Dataset**: This dataset is used to test the method's robustness against noise, providing a controlled environment for evaluation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

The citations I will look for include:

- For the **Crane Dataset**, I will find the original source or paper that introduced this dataset.
- For the **March2 Dataset**, I will similarly locate its original reference.
- The **Samba Dataset** will also need its citation.
- The **MPI Faust Dataset** citation will be sought, as it is a well-known dataset in the field.
- Lastly, I will find the citation for the **Jumping Dataset**.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation in the appropriate format.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining the integrity of the research and providing clear pathways for future researchers to access the data.
