To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Theoretical Insights into the Use of Structural Similarity Index In Generative Models and Inferential Autoencoders" by Benyamin Ghojogh, Fakhri Karray, and Mark Crowley, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) in generative models but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss experiments or applications of the SSIM in various models. However, upon reviewing the text, it appears that the paper is primarily theoretical and does not present empirical results or specific datasets used in experiments. The authors mention various generative models like GMMN, VAE, AAE, GAN, and LSGAN, but they do not provide details about any datasets used for training or evaluation.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. However, the references primarily consist of foundational papers and methodologies related to SSIM and generative models, rather than specific datasets.

Given that there are no datasets explicitly mentioned in the paper or in the references, I will conclude that this paper does not provide any datasets for extraction. 

In summary, I will document that no datasets were found in this paper, and therefore, there are no citations to provide. This is an important finding as it highlights the theoretical nature of the work rather than empirical research that typically involves datasets.
