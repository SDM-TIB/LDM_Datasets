To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction for Data Visualization: An Unsupervised Fuzzy Rule-based Approach" by Suchismita Das and Nikhil R. Pal, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method is applied to **three synthetic and three real-world datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experimentation section** where the authors describe the datasets used. In this section, they mention the following datasets:

1. **Synthetic Datasets**:
   - **Swiss Roll**: A well-known synthetic dataset used in manifold learning, consisting of 2000 points.
   - **S-Curve**: Another synthetic dataset with a similar structure to the Swiss Roll, also containing 2000 points.
   - **Helix**: A synthetic dataset generated using specific mathematical equations, also containing 2000 points.

2. **Real-World Datasets**:
   - **Frey Face Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1965 grayscale images of a single person's face, each of size 20x28 pixels.
   - **COIL Dataset**: Specifically, the first object from the COIL dataset, which contains images of 20 different objects viewed from 72 angles, with each image having a resolution of 32x32 pixels.
   - **USPS Handwritten Digits Dataset**: This dataset contains 1100 images of handwritten digits, specifically focusing on the digit '0', with each image being 16x16 pixels.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. However, the paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets themselves, so I will rely on common knowledge for the citations:

- For **Swiss Roll** and **S-Curve**, these are standard synthetic datasets often referenced in manifold learning literature, but they do not have specific citations.
- For **Helix**, the dataset is generated using specific equations, so it also does not have a formal citation.
- For **Frey Face Dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Roweis, "Data format lab hackers, faces, Freyface," 2020.
  
- For **COIL Dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. A. Nene, S. K. Nayar, H. Murase, et al., "Columbia Object Image Library (COIL-20)," 2020.
  
- For **USPS Handwritten Digits Dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Roweis, "Data format lab hackers, USPS," 2020.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets and their references for further use.
