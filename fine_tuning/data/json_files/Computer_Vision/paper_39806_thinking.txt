To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Seeing Convolution Through the Eyes of Finite Transformation Semigroup Theory: An Abstract Algebraic Interpretation of Convolutional Neural Networks" by Andrew Hryniowski and Alexander Wong, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss convolutional neural networks and their applications but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **experiments section** where datasets are more likely to be mentioned.

In **section 5 (Experiments)**, the authors describe two experiments. In the first experiment, they mention using the **MNIST dataset** for testing the LeNet-5 convolutional neural network architecture. This is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition.

In the second experiment, they refer to the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, which is commonly used for image classification tasks. This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
   > Yann LeCun. The MNIST database of handwritten digits. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, 1998.

2. For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*. 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be clearly described with its citation to ensure proper attribution.
