To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Analysis of the Variance of Diffusion-based Speech Enhancement" by Bunlong Lay and Timo Gerkmann, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in previous works.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.3 (Datasets)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors mention the **DNS4 dataset**, which is described as a large dataset designed for speech enhancement challenges. They specify that it provides clean speech signals and noise clips for mixing, and they detail how they used the dataset in their experiments.

I will note the specifics provided in this section:
- The dataset includes anechoic English clean speech from the LibriVox corpus mixed with noise clips at various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).
- The training set contains 17 hours of paired clean and noisy mixture files, while both the validation and test sets consist of 1.7 hours each.

After identifying the dataset, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DNS4 dataset. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and will be included in the dataset description.

The citation for the DNS4 dataset is:
> H. Dubey, V. Gopal, R. Cutler, S. Matusevych, S. Braun, E. S. Eskimez, M. Thakker, T. Yoshioka, H. Gamper, and R. Aichner. "ICASSP 2022 deep noise suppression challenge," in IEEE Int. Conf. on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Proc. (ICASSP), 2022.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will allow for clear communication of the dataset's relevance and origin in the context of the research paper.
