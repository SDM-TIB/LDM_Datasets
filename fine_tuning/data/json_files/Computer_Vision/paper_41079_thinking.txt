To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Wavelet Domain Style Transfer for an Effective Perception-distortion Tradeoff in Single Image Super-Resolution" by Xin Deng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract states that the method is tested on "various datasets," which indicates that there are specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look closely at the **experimental setup section** to find detailed mentions of the datasets. In this section, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments, which include:

1. **Set5**: A commonly used benchmark dataset for single image super-resolution, consisting of 5 images.
2. **Set14**: Another benchmark dataset that includes 14 images, widely used in super-resolution tasks.
3. **BSD100**: A dataset containing 100 images, often used for evaluating image processing algorithms.
4. **Urban100**: A dataset specifically designed for urban scene super-resolution, containing 100 images.
5. **PIRM**: The dataset used in the PIRM challenge on perceptual image super-resolution.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Set5**:

- For **PIRM**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
