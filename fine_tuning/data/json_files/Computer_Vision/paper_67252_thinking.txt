To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WavePlanes: A compact Wavelet representation for Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields" by Adrian Azzarelli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a new model for dynamic scenes, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed. In this paper, the authors mention using the **DyNeRF dataset** and the **LLFF dataset** for their experiments. I will note down the context in which these datasets are used, as this will help in understanding their relevance to the research.

In the **results section**, the authors provide quantitative results for their model using these datasets. They specifically mention the performance metrics achieved on the **DyNeRF dataset** and the **LLFF dataset**, which confirms their usage in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

1. For the **DyNeRF dataset**, the citation is:
   > Tianye Li, Mira Slavcheva, Michael Zollhoefer, Simon Green, Christoph Lassner, Changil Kim, Tanner Schmidt, Steven Lovegrove, Michael Goesele, Richard Newcombe, et al. *Neural 3D video synthesis from multi-view video*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 5521â€“5531, 2022.

2. For the **LLFF dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P. Srinivasan, Rodrigo Ortiz-Cayon, Nima Khademi Kalantari, Ravi Ramamoorthi, Ren Ng, and Abhishek Kar. *Local light field fusion: Practical view synthesis with prescriptive sampling guidelines*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 2019.

Having gathered this information, I will now summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will facilitate easy reference and understanding for anyone reviewing the research paper.
