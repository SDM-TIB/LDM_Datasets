To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automated Denoising Score Matching for Nonlinear Diffusions" by Raghav Singhal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and I will look for any mention of datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

In the **introduction**, I will look for statements that indicate the use of specific datasets. The authors may describe the context of their work and mention datasets that are relevant to their research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically detail the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for sections that explicitly list datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **CIFAR10 dataset** for their experiments. This dataset is commonly used in image classification tasks and is a well-known benchmark in the field of machine learning.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR10 dataset. The CIFAR10 dataset is often cited as follows:

- For the CIFAR10 dataset, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2009. URL: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **CIFAR10 Dataset**: A widely used dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.

Now, I will prepare the final output with the dataset information and its citation, ensuring that it is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
