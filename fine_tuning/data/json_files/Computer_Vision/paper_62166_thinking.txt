To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NeRF Synthesis with Shading Guidance" by Chenbin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the effectiveness of the method is evaluated on synthetic data and real-world data, which indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention that they evaluated their method mainly on synthetic data and also collected a significant amount of real-world data. They specify that for synthetic scenes, they assume the volume of interest is within a unit cube and collected 100 observation images from various viewpoints. For real-world scenes, they used 300 images, which were manually calibrated to eliminate background interference.

In this section, the authors do not provide specific names for the datasets used, but they do mention the number of images and the context in which they were collected. Therefore, I will note that the datasets consist of:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: Comprising 100 observation images collected from a unit cube with cameras randomly distributed on a hemisphere.
2. **Real-World Dataset**: Comprising 300 images collected from real-world scenes, with background information manually removed and calibrated using colmap.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any specific datasets are cited. However, the references primarily focus on related works and methods rather than specific datasets. Since the authors did not provide formal citations for the datasets, I will note that the datasets are described in general terms without specific citations.

Finally, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring to include the context and details provided in the paper, even though specific citations are not available.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

- **Synthetic Dataset**: 100 observation images from a unit cube.
- **Real-World Dataset**: 300 images from real-world scenes, calibrated and background-removed.

I will now prepare to format this information according to the required structure for further processing or review.
