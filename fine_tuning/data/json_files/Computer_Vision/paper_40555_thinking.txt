To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SPA-GAN: Spatial Attention GAN for Image-to-Image Translation" by Hajar Emami et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, specifically section IV, the authors mention evaluating SPA-GAN on several datasets. I will focus on this section to gather detailed information about each dataset used in their experiments.

The paper lists the following datasets:

1. **Horse ↔ Zebra Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for image-to-image translation tasks, particularly in the context of translating between different animal types.
   
2. **Apple ↔ Orange Dataset**: This dataset is also widely used for image-to-image translation, focusing on translating between two types of fruit.

3. **Lion ↔ Tiger Dataset**: This dataset consists of images of lions and tigers, with 2,086 images for tigers and 1,795 images for lions, sourced from ImageNet.

4. **Winter ↔ Summer Dataset**: This dataset is used for translating images depicting seasonal changes.

5. **Facescrub Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for gender conversion tasks in image-to-image translation.

6. **GTA ↔ Cityscapes Dataset**: This dataset is used for translating images between the Grand Theft Auto (GTA) game environment and real urban scenes from the Cityscapes dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract include:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
