To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "OTF: Optimal Transport based Fusion of Supervised and Self-Supervised Learning Models for Automatic Speech Recognition" by Li Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to using the **1k-hour English LibriSpeech dataset** and an **in-house 2.6k-hour Chinese dataset** for their experiments. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the study.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Experimental setup)**, where the authors provide more details about the datasets used. They mention:

1. **LibriSpeech Dataset**: This is a public dataset containing 1,000 hours of speech-text pairs, which is commonly used for training and evaluating ASR systems.

2. **In-house Chinese Dataset**: This dataset consists of 150,000 hours of Mandarin-Cantonese speech data, with only 2.6k hours labeled. The authors specify that the dataset has a ratio of Mandarin to Cantonese of 10:1.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they evaluated their method using these two datasets, reinforcing their importance in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **LibriSpeech Dataset**, the citation is:
  > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey et al., *Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*, in Proc. ICASSP, 2015.

- The **in-house Chinese dataset** does not have a specific citation provided in the references, as it is an internal dataset created by the authors. Therefore, I will note it as an in-house dataset without a formal citation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the LibriSpeech dataset and noting the in-house dataset appropriately. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
