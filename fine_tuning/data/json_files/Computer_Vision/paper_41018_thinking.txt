To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stabilizing Generative Adversarial Networks: A Survey" by Maciej Wiatrak et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on GANs and their training challenges, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide context or examples that could hint at specific datasets used in GAN research.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss experiments, methodologies, or specific GAN implementations. I will look for any mentions of datasets used in the studies or surveys discussed. If the authors reference specific GANs or their applications, I will note any datasets associated with those works.

I will also pay close attention to the **references section** at the end of the paper. This section is crucial as it often contains full citations for datasets that are mentioned throughout the text. If a dataset is referenced in the main body, I will cross-reference it with the citations to ensure I have the correct and complete citation.

As I go through the paper, I will take notes on any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and the context in which they are used. If the paper discusses multiple GAN variants or techniques, I will ensure to capture datasets associated with each of those methods.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the information, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as they appear in the references section. This will involve formatting the citations correctly, following the style used in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear and organized manner, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, a brief description, and the corresponding full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further analysis or use in related research.
