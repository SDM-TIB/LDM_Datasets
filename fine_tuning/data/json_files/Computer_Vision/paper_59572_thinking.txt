To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TIFA: Accurate and Interpretable Text-to-Image Faithfulness Evaluation with Question Answering" by Yushi Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces TIFA v1.0, a benchmark consisting of 4K diverse text inputs and 25K questions across 12 categories. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, and I need to gather more details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (TIFA v1.0: Benchmark for Text-to-Image Generation Faithfulness)**, where the authors describe the benchmark in detail. Here, they mention that TIFA v1.0 consists of 4,081 text inputs, which are sourced from various datasets, including:

1. **MSCOCO captions**: 2,000 text inputs are taken from the COCO validation set, which is a well-known dataset in the field of computer vision.

2. **DrawBench**: 161 text inputs are collected from this dataset, which is used for generating artistic prompts.

3. **PartiPrompt**: 1,420 text inputs are sourced from this dataset, which focuses on abstract prompts.

4. **PaintSkill**: 500 text inputs are included from this dataset, which is also used for evaluating generative models.

In the **experiments section**, the authors evaluate existing text-to-image models using TIFA v1.0, confirming that the datasets mentioned are indeed utilized for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MSCOCO**, the citation is:

- For **DrawBench**, the citation is:

Denton, Seyed Kamyar Seyed Ghasemipour, Burcu Karagol Ayan, Seyedeh Sara Mahdavi, Raphael Gontijo Lopes, Tim Salimans, Jonathan Ho, David J. Fleet, and Mohammad Norouzi. *Photorealistic text-to-image diffusion models with deep language understanding*. ArXiv preprint arXiv:2205.11487, 2022.

- For **PartiPrompt**, the citation is:

- For **PaintSkill**, the citation is:
  > Ranjay Krishna, Michael S. Bernstein, and Li Fei-Fei. *Information maximizing visual question generation*. 2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2008–2018, 2019.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation for clarity and proper attribution.
