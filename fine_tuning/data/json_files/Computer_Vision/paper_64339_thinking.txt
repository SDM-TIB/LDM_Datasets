To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Promises of Deep Kernel Learning for Control Synthesis" by Robert Reed et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "various benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors provide a table (Table I) that outlines the systems considered, including their dimensionality, number of actions, and the number of data points collected. This table indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to extract the specific dataset names and their citations.

Upon reviewing the table and the surrounding text, I identify the following datasets:

1. **Non-linear System Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed methods. The paper references prior works ([3], [17]) that likely provide the original datasets or methodologies for generating these datasets.

2. **Dubin’s Car Dataset**: This dataset is specifically mentioned in the context of the experiments, and it is associated with the references [17].

3. **2nd-order Car Dataset**: Similar to the Dubin’s Car, this dataset is also referenced in the context of the experiments and is associated with the same references.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Non-linear System Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jackson, J., Laurenti, L., Frew, E., & Lahijanian, M. (2021). *Strategy synthesis for partially-known switched stochastic systems*. In Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control (HSCC '21). New York, NY, USA: Association for Computing Machinery.

- For the **Dubin’s Car Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Adams, S. A., Lahijanian, M., & Laurenti, L. (2022). *Formal control synthesis for stochastic neural network dynamic models*. IEEE Control Systems Letters.

- For the **2nd-order Car Dataset**, the citation is the same as for the Dubin’s Car, as both datasets are derived from similar experimental setups.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited according to the standards of academic writing. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
