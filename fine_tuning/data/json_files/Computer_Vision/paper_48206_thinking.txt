To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ABCNet v2: Adaptive Bezier-Curve Network for Real-time End-to-end Text Spotting" by Yuliang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that comprehensive experiments were conducted on various bilingual benchmark datasets, indicating that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention several datasets:

1. **Bezier Curve Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset consists of 150,000 synthesized images, with a mix of straight and curved text. The authors explain how they generated this dataset using the VGG synthetic method and provide details about the annotations.

2. **Total-Text Dataset**: This dataset is highlighted as a significant benchmark for arbitrarily shaped scene text, containing 1,555 images with word-level annotations. The authors provide details about its composition and the nature of the text instances.

3. **SCUT-CTW1500 Dataset**: Another important dataset mentioned, which includes both English and Chinese text, with annotations based on text-line levels. The authors specify the number of training and testing images.

4. **ICDAR 2015 Dataset**: This dataset is noted for its complexity, containing images captured in real-world conditions with various orientations and backgrounds.

5. **MSRA-TD500 Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as containing multi-oriented Chinese and English images, with a specific number of training and testing images.

6. **ICDAR 2019-ReCTs Dataset**: This dataset includes annotated signboard images, providing a rich source of text data for training.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are as follows:

- For the **Bezier Curve Synthetic Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Total-Text Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **ICDAR 2015 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Karatzas, D., Gomez-Bigorda, L., et al. *ICDAR 2015 Competition on Robust Reading*. In Proceedings of the IAPR International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, 2015.

- For the **MSRA-TD500 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yao, C., Bai, X., Liu, W., Ma, Y., & Tu, Z. *Detecting Texts of Arbitrary Orientations in Natural Images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2012.

- For the **ICDAR 2019-ReCTs Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, R., Zhou, Y., Jiang, Q., Song, Q., Li, N., Zhou, K., Wang, D., Liao, M., Yang, M., et al. *ICDAR 2019 Robust Reading Challenge on Reading Chinese Text on Signboard*. In Proceedings of the IAPR International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, 2019.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
