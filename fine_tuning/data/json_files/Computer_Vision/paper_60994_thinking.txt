To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differential Convolutional Fuzzy Time Series Forecasting" by Tianxiang Zhan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used. The experimental section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets employed in the study.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they will be using datasets for their experiments, which indicates that I should look for specific names and descriptions of these datasets later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental section** where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention five datasets, which I will summarize as follows:

1. **Construction Cost Index (CCI)**: This dataset consists of 295 data values published monthly from January 1990 to July 2014. It is used to forecast non-stationary time series with significant trends.

2. **M1 Competition Dataset**: This dataset includes 1001 time series that are not real-time, serving as a benchmark for evaluating forecasting methods.

3. **M2 Competition Dataset**: This dataset contains 29 real-time time series from various collaborating organizations.

4. **M3 Competition Dataset**: This dataset comprises 3003 time series across multiple domains, including micro, industry, macro, finance, and demographics.

5. **M4 Competition Dataset**: This dataset includes 100,000 time series with various frequencies, such as yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily, and hourly.

After identifying the datasets, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Construction Cost Index (CCI)**, the citation is:
> Ashuri, B., & Lu, J. (2010). Time series analysis of ENR construction cost index. *Journal of Construction Engineering and Management*, 136(11), 1227-1237.

For the **M1 Competition**, the citation is:
> Hyndman, R. J., Koehler, A. B., Ord, J. K., & Snyder, R. D. (2008). Forecasting with exponential smoothing: the state space approach. *Springer Science & Business Media*.

For the **M2 Competition**, the citation is:
> Hyndman, R. J., & Athanasopoulos, G. (2018). Forecasting: principles and practice. *OTexts*.

For the **M3 Competition**, the citation is:
> Makridakis, S., Spiliotis, E., & Assimakopoulos, V. (2020). M4 Competition: Results, conclusions and way forward. *International Journal of Forecasting*, 36(1), 1-10.

For the **M4 Competition**, the citation is:
> Monash Time Series Forecasting Repository. (2021). Monash time series forecasting archive. Retrieved from https://forecastingdata.org/.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
