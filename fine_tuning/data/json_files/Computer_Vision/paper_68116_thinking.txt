To extract datasets from the research paper titled "M3D: Dataset Condensation by Minimizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy" by Hansong Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on various datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified. The introduction further elaborates on the challenges of training with large-scale datasets, suggesting that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments on several datasets, including:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, all in grayscale with a size of 28x28 pixels.

2. **Fashion-MNIST**: Similar to MNIST, this dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, but it features 10 different fashion categories.

3. **SVHN**: The Street View House Numbers dataset, which consists of 73,257 training images and 26,032 testing images, primarily used for digit recognition in natural images.

4. **CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100**: CIFAR-10 consists of 60,000 color images across 10 classes, while CIFAR-100 contains 100 classes with 600 images per class.

5. **ImageNet subsets**: The paper mentions experiments conducted on subsets of the ImageNet dataset, specifically ImageNet-10 and ImageNet-100, which are composed of 10 and 100 subclasses, respectively.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
