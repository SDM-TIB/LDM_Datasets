To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Duality in Optimal Consumptionâ€“Investment Problems with Alternative Data" by Kexin Chen and Hoi Ying Wong, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of alternative data such as social media commentary, expert opinions, and COVID-19 pandemic data, which suggests that these may be the datasets of interest.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors may describe how they utilized these alternative data sources in their analysis. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets.

In the **experiments** section, if the authors provide details about the datasets used for their analysis, I will note down the names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics or characteristics mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using COVID-19 data, I will look for the specific source of that data, such as a publicly available dataset or a specific study that compiled such data. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication year, and any other relevant details for proper citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset.
3. The full citation for the dataset.

Finally, I will format this information clearly and concisely, ready for any further processing or review. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
