To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DomainVerse: A Benchmark Towards Real-World Distribution Shifts For Tuning-Free Adaptive Domain Generalization" by Feng Hou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces a new dataset called **DomainVerse**, which is a significant focus of the paper. This indicates that I should look for detailed descriptions of this dataset in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (DomainVerse)**, where the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset. They describe DomainVerse as consisting of approximately **0.5 million images from 390 fine-grained realistic domains**. This section will likely contain the most critical information about the dataset's structure, purpose, and characteristics.

In addition to DomainVerse, the authors reference several existing datasets in the context of their work. I will look for mentions of these datasets in the **related work section** and throughout the paper. The following datasets are explicitly mentioned:

1. **PACS**: A dataset with four distinct domains (art painting, cartoon, photo, and sketch) containing a total of **9,991 images**.
2. **Office-Home**: A dataset with four domains (art, clipart, product, and real-world) containing **15,913 images**.
3. **Digits-Five**: A dataset tailored for handwritten digit recognition, with a focus on domain shifts related to color variation, containing **145,298 images**.
4. **DomainNet**: A dataset with six domains, containing **569,010 images**.
5. **VLCS**: A dataset with four domains, containing **10,729 images**.
6. **NICO++**: A dataset that includes real-world photos, containing **13,297 images**.
7. **OOD-CV**: A dataset with **232,400 images**.

After identifying these datasets, I will consult the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide a complete context for each dataset.

The citations I will extract are as follows:

- For **DomainVerse**, since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries and their citations into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
