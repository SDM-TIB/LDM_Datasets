To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical 3D fully convolutional networks for multi-organ segmentation" by Holger R. Roth et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their model on manually labeled CT scans of seven abdominal structures, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look for specific details in the **Methods** and **Experiments & Results** sections. In the **Experiments & Results** section, the authors mention that their dataset consists of **331 contrast-enhanced abdominal clinical CT images** used for training and validation, with a split of **281 for training and 50 for validation**. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

Additionally, they mention testing on a different dataset consisting of **150 abdominal CT scans** acquired from a different hospital. This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved: one for training/validation and another for testing.

Now, I will summarize the datasets:

1. **Training and Validation Dataset**: This dataset includes **331 contrast-enhanced abdominal clinical CT images**. The authors specify that the images consist of **460−1177 slices of 512×512 pixels** with voxel dimensions ranging from **[0.59-0.98, 0.59-0.98, 0.5-1.0] mm**.

2. **Testing Dataset**: This dataset comprises **150 abdominal CT scans** from a different hospital, with each volume consisting of **263−1061 slices of 512×512 pixels** and voxel dimensions of **[0.55-0.82, 0.55-0.82, 0.4-0.80] mm**.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely proprietary or not published separately. Instead, I will note the relevant papers cited in the context of the methods used, which may provide additional context for the datasets.

The relevant citations from the references that pertain to the methods and architectures used in the study include:

- C¸ i¸cek, O., Abdulkadir, A., Lienkamp, S. S., Brox, T., & Ronneberger, O. (2016). *3D U-Net: Learning dense volumetric segmentation from sparse annotation*. In MICCAI (pp. 424–432). Springer.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with the relevant information, ensuring to include the context of their use in the study, even if specific citations for the datasets themselves are not available.
