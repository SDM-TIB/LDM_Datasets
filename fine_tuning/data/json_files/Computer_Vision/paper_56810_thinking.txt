To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Conditioned Embedding Diffusion for Text Generation" by Robin Strudel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**. Here, the authors discuss the motivation behind their work and the context of their research. While they mention the potential of their method, they do not specify any datasets.

I will then examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, the authors state that they trained their models on the **C4 dataset**. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed method.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the C4 dataset, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citation for the C4 dataset is as follows:
> Colin Raffel, Noam Shazeer, Adam Roberts, Katherine Lee, Sharan Narang, Michael Matena, Yanqi Zhou, Wei Li, and Peter J. Liu. *Exploring the limits of transfer learning with a unified text-to-text transformer*. J. Mach. Learn. Res., 21:140:1â€“140:67, 2020.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

The only dataset extracted from this paper is the **C4 dataset**, and I will ensure to include its full citation in my final output. 

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the C4 dataset, ensuring that it is ready for any further processing or review.
