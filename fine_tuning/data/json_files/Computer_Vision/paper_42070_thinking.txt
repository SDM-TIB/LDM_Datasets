To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving GANs for Speech Enhancement" by Huy Phan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but the experiments section is likely to contain specific details about the datasets used.

In the **experiments section (V)**, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on a database referenced as [28], which is derived from the Voice Bank corpus. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, and I need to gather more details about it.

Next, I will look for the specific description of the dataset in the **experiments section**. The authors state that the database consists of data from 30 speakers, with a training set from 28 speakers and a test set from 2 speakers. They also describe how the noisy conditions were created, which is important for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Voice Bank corpus, as well as any other datasets mentioned. The relevant citation for the Voice Bank corpus is:

- For the Voice Bank corpus:
  > C. Veaux, J. Yamagishi, and S. King. "The voice bank corpus: design, collection and data analysis of a large regional accent speech database." In Proceedings of the 2013 International Conference Oriental COCOSDA, pages 1–4, 2013.

Additionally, the authors mention using noise from the Demand database [30]. I will also look for the citation for this dataset in the references:

- For the Demand database:
  > J. Thiemann, N. Ito, and E. Vincent. "The diverse environments multi-channel acoustic noise database: A database of multichannel environmental noise recordings." The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, vol. 133, no. 5, pp. 3591–3591, 2013.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Voice Bank Corpus**: A dataset consisting of speech data from 30 speakers, used for training and testing speech enhancement models.
2. **Demand Database**: A collection of environmental noise recordings used to create noisy conditions for the speech enhancement experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the full citation as required. This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
