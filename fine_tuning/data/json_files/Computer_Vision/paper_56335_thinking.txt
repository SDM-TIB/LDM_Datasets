To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep-Based Quality Assessment of Medical Images Through Domain Adaptation" by Marouane Tliba et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed model is evaluated through a dataset composed of images and their subjective scores, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention two datasets:

1. **TID13 Dataset**: The authors specify that they used a subset of the TID13 dataset, consisting of 125 denoised images derived from 25 reference images, with corresponding Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) provided for each image.

2. **MD72 Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 72 liver ultrasound images, with 60 denoised images derived from 12 pristine images through five denoising algorithms, also accompanied by MOS values.

To ensure accuracy, I will check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets:

- For the **TID13 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nikolay Ponomarenko et al., "Color image database TID2013: Peculiarities and preliminary results," in European Workshop on Visual Information Processing (EUVIP), 2013, pp. 106â€“111.

- For the **MD72 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Outtas et al., "Subjective and objective evaluations of feature selected multi output filter for speckle reduction on ultrasound images," Physics in Medicine and Biology, vol. 63, no. 18, pp. 185014, Sept. 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have a clear and organized representation of the datasets used in the research.
