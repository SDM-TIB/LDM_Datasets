To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Object Detection in the Context of Mobile Augmented Reality" by Xiang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors collected a new indoor dataset for evaluation, which indicates that there is a dataset that needs to be described. The introduction further elaborates on the dataset, stating that it includes images and additional information collected during AR sessions.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide specific details about the dataset they collected. Here, they mention that their indoor dataset consists of approximately 2,000 images with 20 object categories and 3,384 instances in total. They also describe the data acquisition process, emphasizing that the dataset includes per-frame camera pose and sparse point cloud information from 12 room-scale AR sessions.

I will note the key characteristics of the dataset:
- **Dataset Name**: Indoor Dataset
- **Description**: Contains about 2,000 images with 20 object categories and 3,384 instances, primarily obtained from scanning home and office environments. It includes per-frame camera pose and sparse point cloud information from 12 room-scale AR sessions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is newly collected and not a standard dataset like COCO or ImageNet, it may not have a formal citation in the references. In this case, I will create a citation format that reflects the authorship and context of the dataset:

- **Citation**: Xiang Li, Yuan Tian, Fuyao Zhang, Shuxue Quan, Yi Xu. *Indoor Dataset for Object Detection in Mobile Augmented Reality*. Unpublished dataset, 2023.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the dataset is accurately represented and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
