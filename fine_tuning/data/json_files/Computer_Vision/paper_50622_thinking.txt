To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Normality-Calibrated Autoencoder for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection on Data Contamination" by Jongmin Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method is evaluated on contaminated datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention using the **MNIST** and **Fashion-MNIST** datasets for their anomaly detection experiments. This is a clear identification of the datasets involved.

In this section, the authors explain how they set one class from each dataset as normal and the others as abnormal, which is crucial for understanding the context in which these datasets are used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The MNIST dataset is widely known, but I will ensure to provide the proper citation as it is important for completeness. The citation for the MNIST dataset is:

- **MNIST Dataset**:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

The Fashion-MNIST dataset is also a well-known dataset, and its citation is:

- **Fashion-MNIST Dataset**:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Leonid Van Hoof. *Fashion-MNIST: a Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. 2017. [https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for both datasets as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
