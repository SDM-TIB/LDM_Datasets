To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The PHOTON Wizard - Towards Educational Machine Learning Code Generators" by Ramona Leenings et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and discussion sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but it may not contain specific dataset information. The introduction may mention datasets in the context of existing educational resources or machine learning libraries.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly any subsections that discuss data processing or machine learning pipelines. This section is likely to contain specific references to datasets used in the implementation of the PHOTON Wizard or examples of datasets that the tool can handle.

I will also check the **discussion section** for any mentions of datasets that were used for testing or validating the PHOTON Wizard. This section may provide insights into the datasets that the authors consider relevant for their educational approach.

After identifying any datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. It is crucial to ensure that I capture the complete citation details, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

If the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will note that as well. However, if datasets are referenced, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, making sure to include the full citations for each dataset in a clear and organized manner, ready for any further processing or review.
