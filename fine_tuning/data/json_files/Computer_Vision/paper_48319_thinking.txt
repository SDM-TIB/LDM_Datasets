To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient and Robust LiDAR-Based End-to-End Navigation" by Zhijian Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation or training.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss related work and may reference datasets that have been previously used in the field. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to prior studies that utilized specific datasets.

In the **methodology section**, I will pay close attention to any descriptions of data collection processes. The authors mention collecting a small-scale real-world dataset with 32 km of driving, which indicates that there is a dataset involved. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its size, the conditions under which it was collected, and any specific characteristics mentioned.

In the **experimental setup section**, I will look for any additional datasets that may have been used for training or testing the models. The authors may describe how they processed or augmented the data, which can provide insights into the dataset's structure and purpose.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

From the paper, I have identified the following dataset:

1. **Real-world driving dataset**: This dataset consists of 32 km of driving data collected in a suburban area, with 29 km used for training and 3 km for testing. The dataset includes LiDAR point clouds and GPS localization data.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset based on the information provided in the references section. Since the dataset is derived from the authors' own collection, I will format it accordingly:

- For the **real-world driving dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhijian Liu, Alexander Amini, Sibo Zhu, Sertac Karaman, Song Han, and Daniela L. Rus. *Efficient and Robust LiDAR-Based End-to-End Navigation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2023.

Finally, I will summarize the extracted dataset information and prepare it for structured output, ensuring that all relevant details and citations are included for future reference.
