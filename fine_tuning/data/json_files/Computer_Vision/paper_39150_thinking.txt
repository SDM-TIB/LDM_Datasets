To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compression and Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks via Tucker Tensor Layer: From First Principles to Tensor Valued Back-Propagation" by Giuseppe G. Calvi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed framework is validated on benchmark datasets, specifically **MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10**. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of these datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. In the introduction, the authors state that their framework is validated on these datasets, which confirms their relevance.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about how they applied their method to each dataset. They mention:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits, each of size 28x28 pixels. The authors report achieving a compression factor of 66.63 while maintaining comparable performance.

2. **Fashion-MNIST Dataset**: This dataset serves as a more complex alternative to MNIST, containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of fashion products, also sized 28x28 pixels. The authors note that their method achieved a compression factor of 66.63 with a slight drop in accuracy.

3. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The authors mention that their method was applied to this dataset as well, although they report a drop in performance compared to the other datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. LeCun, “The MNIST database of handwritten digits,” http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, 1998.

- For **Fashion-MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > H. Xiao, K. Rasul, and R. Vollgraf, “Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms,” arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

- For **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Krizhevsky, G. Hinton et al., “Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images,” Citeseer, Tech. Rep., 2009.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
