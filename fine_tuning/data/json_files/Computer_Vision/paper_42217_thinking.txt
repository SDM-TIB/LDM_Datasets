To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Anomaly Detection by One Class Latent Regularized Networks" by Chengwei Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on the **MNIST**, **CIFAR10**, and **GTSRB stop signs** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the study.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 3) to gather more detailed descriptions of each dataset. In section 3.1, the authors provide specific information about the datasets used:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of 60,000 handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The authors mention that they treat one class as the normal class while the others are considered anomalies, leading to ten sets of MNIST data.

2. **CIFAR10 Dataset**: Similar to MNIST, this dataset contains ten classes of images. The authors again treat one class as normal and the rest as anomalies, allowing for anomaly detection based on the normal class.

3. **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)**: This dataset includes adversarial boundary attacks on stop sign images. The authors describe how adversarial examples are generated from randomly drawn stop sign images using a specific method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 2010.

- For the **CIFAR10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 Datasets*. 2009.

- For the **GTSRB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Johannes Stallkamp, Marc Schlipsing, Jan Salmen, and Christian Igel. *The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark: A Multi-Class Classification Competition*. In IJCNN, 2011, vol. 6, p. 7.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
