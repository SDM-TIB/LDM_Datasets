To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ricci flow-guided autoencoders in learning time-dependent dynamics" by Andrew Gracyk, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the methodology and its application to various numerical experiments, which may imply the use of datasets, but I need to look for specific names or descriptions.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) in detail, as this is where datasets are most likely to be explicitly mentioned. I will look for subsections that describe the experiments conducted, particularly focusing on any numerical experiments involving partial differential equations (PDEs). 

In **section 4.1**, the paper discusses the "Viscous Burgerâ€™s equation" and mentions that the training data was constructed using a pseudo-spectral method with Fast Fourier transforms. However, it does not provide a specific dataset name. I will note that the data was generated from a specific equation and the parameters used.

In **section 4.2**, the "Diffusion-reaction equation" is introduced, and it states that datasets were constructed over a specific domain with initial data generated from a Fourier series. Again, while the methodology is described, specific dataset names are not provided.

In **section 4.3**, the "Navier-Stokes equation" is discussed, and it mentions that data was constructed using a discontinuous Galerkin/Fourier spectral solver. This section also lacks specific dataset names.

Throughout the paper, while there are references to the methods used to generate datasets, there are no explicit dataset names provided. Therefore, I will summarize the datasets based on the equations and methods described, but I will note that they are not standard datasets with formal citations.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited there. The references primarily consist of papers that describe the methodologies and equations used, rather than specific datasets.

Since the paper does not provide formal dataset names or citations, I will document the datasets based on the equations and methods used in the experiments, but I will clarify that these are generated datasets rather than publicly available datasets with citations.

Finally, I will compile my findings into a structured format, ensuring to highlight that the datasets are derived from the methodologies described in the paper rather than being explicitly named datasets with citations.
