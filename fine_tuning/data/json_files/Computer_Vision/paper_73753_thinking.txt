To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-Embodiment Robot Manipulation Skill Transfer using Latent Space Alignment" by Tianyu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of reinforcement learning for robot manipulation tasks, which suggests that datasets may be involved. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this case, the authors mention conducting experiments in the **Robosuite simulation environment** and refer to several tasks: Reach, Lift, PickPlace, and Stack. I will check if they provide details about the datasets used for these tasks.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors collected random trajectories from three different robots (Panda, Sawyer, and xArm6) in the Robosuite simulator. They specify that they collected **10,000 episodes of length 200 for each robot**, which provides a clear indication of the dataset's structure.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific dataset citations for the Robosuite tasks, but it does reference the Robosuite simulator itself. Therefore, I will cite the Robosuite paper as the source of the dataset:

- For the **Robosuite simulator**, the citation is:
  > Zhu, Y., Wong, J., Mandlekar, A., Martín-Martín, R., Joshi, A., Nasiriany, S., & Zhu, Y. (2020). *robosuite: A modular simulation framework and benchmark for robot learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.12293.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Robosuite simulator as the source of the datasets used in the experiments.

By following this methodical approach, I can ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets from the research paper.
