To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EndNet: Sparse AutoEncoder Network for Endmember Extraction and Hyperspectral Unmixing" by Savas Ozkan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions conducting experiments on "several well-known datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention four datasets: 

1. **Urban Dataset**: This dataset is described as having a pixel resolution of 307 × 307 and includes several channels that have been removed due to atmospheric effects. It consists of four constituent materials: Asphalt, Grass, Tree, and Roof.

2. **Samson Dataset**: Generated by the SAMSON sensor, this dataset contains 156 channels covering the spectral range from 0.4 to 0.9 µm. It includes three material types: Soil, Tree, and Water.

3. **Jasper Ridge Dataset**: Captured by the AVIRIS sensor, this dataset has a subimage of 100 × 100 pixels and includes materials such as Tree, Water, Soil, and Road.

4. **Cuprite Dataset**: This dataset, also captured by the AVIRIS sensor, contains 188 spectral reflectance bands and includes 12 unique mineral spectral signatures.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Urban Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Plaza et al., "On the use of small training sets for neural network-based characterization of mixed pixels in remotely sensed hyperspectral images," Pattern Recognition, pp. 3032–3045, 2009.

- For the **Samson Dataset**, the citation is:
  > F. Zhu et al., "Comparison of AVIRIS and Hyperion for hyperspectral mineral mapping," in 11th JPL Airborne Geoscience Workshop, 2002.

- For the **Jasper Ridge Dataset**, the citation is:
  > F. A. Kruse et al., "Comparison of AVIRIS and Hyperion for hyperspectral mineral mapping," in 11th JPL Airborne Geoscience Workshop, 2002.

- For the **Cuprite Dataset**, the citation is:
  > P. Gader et al., "Muuﬂ Gulfport hyperspectral and lidar airborne data set," Univ. Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA, Tech. Rep. REP-2013-570, 2013.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference and use in future research or applications.
