To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gang of GANs: Generative Adversarial Networks with Maximum Margin Ranking" by Felix Juefei-Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on four visual datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention the following datasets:

1. **CelebA Dataset**: This dataset is described as a large-scale face attributes dataset containing over 200,000 celebrity images, covering a wide range of poses and backgrounds.

2. **LSUN Bedroom Dataset**: This dataset is intended for large-scale scene understanding and consists of 3,033,042 images specifically from the bedroom category.

3. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This is a well-known image classification dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes.

4. **50K-SSFF Dataset**: This dataset is a single-sample dataset containing 50,000 frontal face images sourced from various datasets, specifically designed for one-shot learning.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **CelebA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Z. Liu, P. Luo, X. Wang, and X. Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), December 2015.

- For the **LSUN Bedroom Dataset**, the citation is:
  > F. Yu, Y. Zhang, S. Song, A. Seff, and J. Xiao. *LSUN: Construction of a large-scale image dataset using deep learning with humans in the loop*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.03365, 2015.

- For the **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Krizhevsky and G. Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. CIFAR-10 Database, 2009.

- For the **50K-SSFF Dataset**, the citation is:
  > This dataset is compiled from several frontal face datasets including the FRGC v2.0 dataset, the MPIE dataset, the ND-Twin dataset, and the mugshot dataset from Pinellas County Sheriffâ€™s Office (PCSO). Specific citation details for each source may be required for comprehensive referencing.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
