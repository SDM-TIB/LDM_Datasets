To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Who You Play Affects How You Play: Predicting Sports Performance Using Graph Attention Networks With Temporal Convolution" by Rui Luo and Vikram Krishnamurthy, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses "real-world sports data," which suggests that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find specific details.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors provide a detailed account of the dataset they constructed. Here, they describe the dataset as covering the 2022-23 NBA regular season, which includes player statistics and match information. This section is crucial as it outlines the specifics of the dataset, including the types of statistics collected.

The authors mention that the dataset includes:
- **Player Statistics**: Covering 13 different statistics such as Points (PTS), Assists (AST), Rebounds (REB), etc.
- **Match Information**: Used to construct player interaction graphs.

In this section, they also mention that the data was collected using APIs from NBA.com, which is important for understanding the source of the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) as a significant resource for geometric deep learning, but they also indicate that their dataset is unique for sports analytics.

The citation for the dataset is not explicitly provided in the references, but I can summarize the dataset's details based on the information given in the paper. Since the dataset is original and created by the authors, I will note that it is an open-sourced dataset for future research.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset's name, description, and any relevant citations or sources.

In summary, the key steps are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the dataset description in section 3 for detailed information.
3. Note the source of the data (NBA.com APIs) and the unique contribution of the dataset.
4. Compile the dataset information, ensuring to highlight its significance and potential for future research.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the dataset details and provide proper citations where applicable.
