To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Merge Tokens in Vision Transformers" by Cedric Renggli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract discusses the PATCHMERGER module and its impact on computational efficiency but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the scaling of models and datasets in deep learning but again do not specify any datasets.

Moving on to the **experimental evaluation section (Section 4)**, I will focus on the **Training Data** subsection. The authors mention that they trained their models on **JFT**, a proprietary dataset containing 300 million images classified into 18,291 classes. This is a significant dataset for their experiments.

I will also look for any other datasets mentioned in the **transfer to ImageNet** subsection, where they describe the transferability of their models. They mention using **ImageNet** for evaluation, which is another important dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **JFT Dataset**: The authors do not provide a specific citation for JFT in the references, as it is proprietary. However, I will note that it is a large-scale dataset used for training.

2. **ImageNet**: The citation for ImageNet is:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 248â€“255. IEEE, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **JFT Dataset**: A proprietary dataset containing 300 million images classified into 18,291 classes.
- **ImageNet**: A well-known dataset used for image classification tasks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.
