To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DualMamba: A Lightweight Spectral-Spatial Mamba-Convolution Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification" by Jiamu Sheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the method was evaluated on **three public HSI datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Indian Pines Dataset**: This dataset was captured in 1992 by the Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and consists of 145 × 145 pixels with 220 spectral bands. After noise reduction, 200 bands are retained for classification, with a total of 10,249 labeled pixels across 16 categories.

2. **WHU-Hi-Longkou Dataset**: Collected in 2018, this dataset includes 550 × 400 pixels with 270 spectral bands. It contains 204,542 labeled samples across 9 object classes.

3. **Houston 2018 Dataset**: This dataset features 601 × 2384 pixels with 48 spectral bands and includes 504,856 labeled pixels across 20 distinct classes.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their characteristics and the number of labeled samples for training and testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
