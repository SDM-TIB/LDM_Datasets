To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Fourier Up-Sampling" by Man Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup in **section 4 (Experiments)**. Here, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for evaluation.

In **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, the authors mention several datasets used for different tasks:

1. **PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012**: These datasets are used for object detection tasks. They are well-known benchmarks in the field of computer vision.
   
2. **Synapse Dataset and CANDI Dataset**: These datasets are utilized for medical image segmentation tasks.

3. **Rain200H and Rain200L**: These datasets are standard benchmarks for image de-raining evaluations.

4. **RESIDE Dataset**: This dataset is used for image dehazing evaluations.

5. **WorldView II, WorldView III, and GaoFen2**: These datasets are employed for guided image super-resolution tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.
