To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating Synthetic Clinical Data that Capture Class Imbalanced Distributions with Generative Adversarial Networks: Example Using Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV" by Nicholas I-Hsien Kuo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions that the study is based on the **EuResist Integrated Database (EIDB)**, which is a key dataset for the research.

Next, I will look into the **background** and **methods** sections, particularly focusing on any specific datasets used for training or evaluation. In section 2.1, the authors describe the **ground truth ART for HIV dataset**, which consists of 8,916 patients and 332,800 records sourced from the **EuResist database**. This dataset is crucial for understanding the context of the study.

I will also check the **ethics statement** to confirm the dataset's accessibility and any restrictions on its use. The authors note that the EIDB can be accessed for scientific studies upon approval, which is important for potential users of the dataset.

In the **results** and **discussion** sections, I will look for any additional datasets mentioned or any synthetic datasets generated as part of the study. The authors indicate that they generated a synthetic dataset using their modified GAN setup, which is also significant.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **EuResist Integrated Database (EIDB)**:
   - Citation:
     > Zazzi, M., Incardona, F., Rosen-Zvi, M., Prosperi, M., Altmann, A., Sonnerborg, A., Lavee, T., Schlüter, E., & Kaiser, R. (2012). Predicting response to antiretroviral treatment by machine learning: the EuResist project. *Intervirology*, 55(2), 123-127.

2. **Synthetic ART for HIV Dataset**:
   - The authors generated a synthetic dataset based on the EIDB, but since it is a product of their research, it does not have a separate citation. However, they mention that this dataset is publicly accessible through their website:
     > Kuo, N. I-H., Garcia, F., Sonnerborg, A., Zazzi, M., Böhm, M., Kaiser, R., Polizzotto, M., Jorm, L., & Barbieri, S. (2021). The Health Gym: Synthetic health-related datasets for the development of reinforcement learning algorithms. *Scientific Data*, 9(1), 1-24. Available at: https://healthgym.ai/

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I accurately document each dataset's details, including their purpose and any relevant characteristics, in a structured format for further analysis or sharing with others interested in this research area.
