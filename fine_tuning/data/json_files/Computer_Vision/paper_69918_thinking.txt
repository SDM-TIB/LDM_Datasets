To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Smooth and Sparse Latent Dynamics in Operator Learning with Jerk Regularization" by Xiaoyu Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, results, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used for validation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, particularly section 3, where the authors discuss the numerical results related to the Navier-Stokes equations. In section 3.1, the authors mention the use of a dataset of solution trajectories from a specific reference. This indicates that there is a dataset being utilized for their experiments.

In section 3.1, the authors specify that the dataset consists of simulation data governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, with a resolution of 256 × 256, which was later downsampled to 64 × 64 for training purposes. They also mention that the dataset includes 50 time steps, with specific time intervals designated for training and testing.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors refer to a dataset from a specific paper, which I need to locate to provide the complete citation.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the dataset is cited as follows:
- For the dataset of solution trajectories, the citation is:
  > Zongyi Li, Nikola Kovachki, Kamyar Azizzadenesheli, Burigede Liu, Kaushik Bhattacharya, Andrew Stuart, and Anima Anandkumar. *Fourier Neural Operator for Parametric Partial Differential Equations*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.08895, 2020.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extracted from the paper:

1. **Navier-Stokes Dataset**: This dataset consists of simulation data for a two-dimensional unsteady flow problem governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. The original resolution of the simulation data was 256 × 256, which was downsampled to 64 × 64 for training. The dataset includes 50 time steps, with specific time intervals for training and testing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
