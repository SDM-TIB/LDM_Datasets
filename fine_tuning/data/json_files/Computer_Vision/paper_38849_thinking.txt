To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Virtual Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks" by Haifeng Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on several balanced and imbalanced image datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention that they tested their model on the following datasets:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset containing 60,000 gray-scale handwritten digit images, which is commonly used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.
2. **Fashion MNIST**: Similar in structure to MNIST, this dataset contains 60,000 images of clothing items, providing a more challenging alternative for testing.
3. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 color images across 10 classes, widely used in the field of computer vision.
4. **Cartoon Set**: An open-source dataset containing 100,000 cartoon face images, which is used to evaluate the model's performance on more complex datasets.
5. **CelebA**: A dataset of 202,599 celebrity face photos, which is used in conjunction with Cartoon Set to create imbalanced datasets for testing.

I will then confirm the details of these datasets in the **experiments section** to ensure I have accurate descriptions and any relevant statistics.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Here are the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
