To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Surprisingly Effective Fix for Deep Latent Variable Modeling of Text" by Bohan Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for experiments. In this case, the introduction mentions that the authors conducted experiments on three text datasets: **Penn Treebank (PTB)**, **Yahoo**, and a downsampled version of **SNLI**.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly state that they worked with the PTB, Yahoo, and SNLI datasets for their experiments. They describe the PTB as a standard dataset for benchmarking VAEs, which confirms its relevance.

Now, I will gather detailed information about each dataset, including their characteristics and any specific configurations mentioned in the paper. The authors provide the following details:

1. **Penn Treebank (PTB)**: A standard dataset for benchmarking VAE that has been used extensively in previous work. The authors mention that they used a specific setup with 32-dimension latent codes.

2. **Yahoo**: Another dataset used in their experiments, but specific details about its characteristics are not elaborated in the text.

3. **SNLI (Stanford Natural Language Inference)**: The authors mention that they used a downsampled version of this dataset, which contains 100K/10K/10K sentences for training/validation/test.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Penn Treebank (PTB)**, the citation is:
  > Marcus, M. P., & Marcinkiewicz, M. A. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313-330.

- For **Yahoo**, the citation is:
  > Yang, Z., Hu, Z., Salakhutdinov, R., & Berg-Kirkpatrick, T. (2017). Improved variational autoencoders for text modeling using dilated convolutions. In *Proceedings of ICML*.

- For **SNLI**, the citation is:
  > Bowman, S. R., Angeli, S., Potts, C., & Manning, C. D. (2015). A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference. In *Proceedings of EMNLP*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its citation, which is crucial for proper attribution in any downstream applications or analyses.
