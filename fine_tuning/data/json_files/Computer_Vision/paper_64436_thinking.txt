To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A performance characteristic curve for model evaluation: the application in information diffusion prediction" by Wenjin Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of prediction models in the context of information diffusion, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Data)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention both synthetic and empirical data:

1. **Synthetic Data**: The authors generated synthetic datasets using the Erdős-Rényi (ER) network and the Barabási-Albert (BA) scale-free network. They ran independent cascade (IC), linear threshold (LT), and susceptible-infectious (SI) models on these networks to create synthetic spreading sequences.

2. **Empirical Data**: The authors utilized spreading sequences from three social media platforms:
   - **Twitter**: Contains 137,093 nodes, 3,589,811 edges, and 569 cascades.
   - **Digg**: Contains 279,632 nodes, 2,617,993 edges, and 3,553 cascades.
   - **Douban**: Collected by the authors, focusing on the "Top 100 users," with 13,777 nodes, 567,250 edges, and 21,756 cascades.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the synthetic datasets are generated by the authors and do not have formal citations, I will focus on the empirical datasets:

- For **Twitter** data, the citation is:
  > Hodas, N. O., & Lerman, K. (2014). The simple rules of social contagion. *Scientific Reports*, 4, 4343.

- For **Digg** data, the citation is:
  > Hogg, T., & Lerman, K. (2012). Social dynamics of digg. *EPJ Data Science*, 1(1), 5.

- For **Douban** data, since it is collected by the authors, I will note that it does not have a formal citation but is described in the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the empirical datasets and a note for the synthetic datasets. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
