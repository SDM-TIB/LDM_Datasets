To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Self Supervision to Distillation for Long-Tailed Visual Recognition" by Tianhao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three long-tailed recognition benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, in the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenges of long-tailed data and refer to their experiments on three specific datasets. I will look for the names of these datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. They specifically mention:

1. **ImageNet-LT**: This dataset is constructed from ImageNet-2012 by sampling a subset following a Pareto distribution. It contains 115.8K images across 1000 classes, with a significant imbalance in the number of images per class.

2. **CIFAR100-LT**: This dataset is derived from CIFAR-100 and has different imbalance factors. It consists of 100 categories, with the imbalance factor defined as the ratio between the most and least frequent classes.

3. **iNaturalist 2018**: This is a real-world dataset containing 437.5K images across 8,142 fine-grained species, with a high imbalance factor.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet-LT**, the citation is:
  > Zhou, B., Cui, Q., Wei, X.-S., & Chen, Z.-M. (2019). *BBN: Bilateral-branch network with cumulative learning for long-tailed visual recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For **CIFAR100-LT**, the citation is:
  > Cao, K., Wei, C., Gaidon, A., Arechiga, N., & Ma, T. (2019). *Learning imbalanced datasets with label-distribution-aware margin loss*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems.

- For **iNaturalist 2018**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I have accurately represented the datasets used in the research.
