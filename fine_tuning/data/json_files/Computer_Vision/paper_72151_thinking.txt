To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learn2Talk: 3D Talking Face Learns from 2D Talking Face" by Yixiang Zhuang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments, which suggests that datasets are likely involved. I will look for any specific dataset names or references in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention two datasets in **section IV (Experiments)**:

1. **BIWI Dataset**: This dataset is described as a 3D audio-visual corpus of affective speech and facial expression, containing 40 sentences uttered by 14 subjects. Each sentence was recorded twice, with and without emotion.

2. **VOCASET Dataset**: This dataset consists of 480 paired audio-visual sequences recorded from 12 subjects, with 255 unique sentences. Each sequence is captured at 60 fps and is between 3 and 4 seconds long.

To confirm the details of these datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **BIWI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > G. Fanelli, J. Gall, H. Romsdorfer, T. Weise, and L. V. Gool. *A 3-D audio-visual corpus of affective communication*. IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, vol. 12, no. 6, pp. 591–598, 2010.

- For the **VOCASET Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. Cudeiro, T. Bolkart, C. Laidlaw, A. Ranjan, and M. J. Black. *Capture, learning, and synthesis of 3D speaking styles*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 10 101–10 111, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, ensuring to include their names, descriptions, and full citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
