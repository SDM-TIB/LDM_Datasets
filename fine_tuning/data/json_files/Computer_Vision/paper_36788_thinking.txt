To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-Time Video Super-Resolution with Spatio-Temporal Networks and Motion Compensation" by Jose Caballero et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that results on publicly available datasets demonstrate the proposed algorithms' performance, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and testing their models. In this section, I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention using the **CDVL database** for training, which contains 115 uncompressed full HD videos. They also refer to a subset of 100 videos chosen for training and 15 videos for testing. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

Additionally, the authors mention benchmarking against various SR methods on publicly available videos referred to as **Vid41**, which is another dataset of interest.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **CDVL database**, the citation is:
> ITS. Consumer Digital Video Library, accessed on 08/2016 at http://www.cdvl.org/.

For the **Vid41 dataset**, the citation is:
> Vid4 dataset, which includes sequences such as walk, city, calendar, and foliage, with sizes of 720 × 480 or 720 × 576.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
