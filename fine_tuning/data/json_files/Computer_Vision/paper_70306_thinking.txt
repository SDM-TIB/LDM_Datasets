To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ChatUIE: Exploring Chat-based Unified Information Extraction using Large Language Models" by Jun Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, but I will focus on the sections where datasets are likely to be detailed.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of information extraction and mention various studies, but I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

Moving to **section 3 (Experimental Settings and Results)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention multiple widely-used datasets, including:

1. **Resume Dataset**: Used for Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks, with a total of 10,472 samples.
2. **CoNLL-2004 Dataset**: Utilized for Relation Extraction (RE), containing 25,665 samples.
3. **FewFC Dataset**: Applied for Event Extraction (EE), comprising 3,263 samples.
4. **WebQA Dataset**: Used for general chat evaluation.
5. **CEval Dataset**: Another dataset for general chat evaluation.
6. **CMMLU Dataset**: Also used for general chat evaluation.
7. **MMLU Dataset**: Included for general chat evaluation.
8. **MSRA Dataset**: Used for zero-shot NER evaluation.
9. **SemEval Dataset**: Used for zero-shot RE evaluation.
10. **iFLYTEK Dataset**: Used for zero-shot EE evaluation.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. Here are the citations I will extract:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
