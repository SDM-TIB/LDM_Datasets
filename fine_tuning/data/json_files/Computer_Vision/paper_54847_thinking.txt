To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CENET: TOWARD CONCISE AND EFFICIENT LIDAR SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION FOR AUTONOMOUS DRIVING" by Hui-Xian Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on **publicly available benchmarks, SemanticKITTI and SemanticPOSS**, indicating that these are the datasets used.

Next, I will look into the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the importance of datasets for LiDAR semantic segmentation. They specifically mention **SemanticKITTI** and **SemanticPOSS** as benchmarks for their experiments, confirming their relevance.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. They state that **SemanticKITTI** consists of 43,551 LiDAR scans from 22 sequences collected in Germany, with specific splits for training, testing, and validation. They also describe **SemanticPOSS** as a smaller dataset with 2,988 complex LiDAR scenes, divided into parts for training and testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **SemanticKITTI**, the citation is:
   > Jens Behley, Martin Garbade, Andres Milioto, Jan Quenzel, Sven Behnke, Cyrill Stachniss, and Jurgen Gall. *SemanticKITTI: A dataset for semantic scene understanding of lidar sequences*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 9297–9307, 2019.

2. For **SemanticPOSS**, the citation is:
   > Yancheng Pan, Biao Gao, Jilin Mei, Sibo Geng, Chengkun Li, and Huijing Zhao. *SemanticPOSS: A point cloud dataset with large quantity of dynamic instances*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), pages 687–693, 2020.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
