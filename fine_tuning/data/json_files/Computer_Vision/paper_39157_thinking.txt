To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quality-aware Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation" by Lei Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on "four real-world datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will navigate to the **experiments section** (Section VI), where the authors provide details about the datasets used. Here, they explicitly list the datasets as follows:

1. **PHOTO-SKETCH Dataset**: This dataset is used for the task of sketch-to-photo translation. The authors mention that it contains 1990 training images and 388 test images.

2. **LABEL-FACADE Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for the label-to-facade translation task, consisting of 800 training images and 200 test images.

3. **OIL-CHINESE Dataset**: This dataset is employed for the Chinese-to-oil translation task, with 2354 training images and 94 test images.

4. **SUMMER-WINTER Dataset**: This dataset is used for the summer-to-winter translation task, containing 1924 training images and 476 test images.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference previous works that introduced these datasets, which will provide the necessary citations.

For the **PHOTO-SKETCH Dataset**, the citation is:
> Yi, Z., Zhang, H., Tan, P., & Gong, M. (2017). DualGAN: Unsupervised dual learning for image-to-image translation. In *IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision* (pp. 2868–2876).

For the **LABEL-FACADE Dataset**, the citation is:
> Yi, Z., Zhang, H., Tan, P., & Gong, M. (2017). DualGAN: Unsupervised dual learning for image-to-image translation. In *IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision* (pp. 2868–2876).

For the **OIL-CHINESE Dataset**, the citation is:
> Yi, Z., Zhang, H., Tan, P., & Gong, M. (2017). DualGAN: Unsupervised dual learning for image-to-image translation. In *IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision* (pp. 2868–2876).

For the **SUMMER-WINTER Dataset**, the citation is:
> Zhu, J.-Y., Park, T., Isola, P., & Efros, A. A. (2017). Unpaired image-to-image translation using cycle-consistent adversarial networks. In *IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision* (pp. 2242–2251).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the paper.
