To extract datasets from the research paper titled "StableSemantics: A Synthetic Language-Vision Dataset of Semantic Representations in Naturalistic Images" by Rushikesh Zawar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a summary of the dataset, indicating that it consists of **224,000 human-curated prompts, over 2 million synthetic images, and 10 million attention maps**. This suggests that there is a significant dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **data collection and dataset exploration sections**. In the data collection section, the authors describe how they collected prompts from the Stable Diffusion Discord server and transformed them into natural language captions. They also mention the generation of images and semantic maps, which are crucial components of the dataset.

In **Table 1**, the authors summarize the dataset's components, which include:
- **Total Images**: 2 million
- **Total Captions**: 224,000
- **Caption Source**: Human Preferred
- **Open-set Semantics**: Yes

This table confirms the dataset's scale and its unique features, such as the inclusion of semantic maps.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The authors reference several datasets that are relevant to their work, including:
- **COCO 2017**:

- **DiffusionDB**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's key features and full citations.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
