To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Schizophrenia detection based on EEG using Recurrent Auto-Encoder framework" by Yihan Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on a dataset containing EEG recordings from 14 schizophrenia patients and 14 healthy control subjects. This suggests that a specific dataset is being used, which I need to detail.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Materials and Methods)**, specifically the **Dataset subsection**. Here, the authors provide a clear description of the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that the dataset was collected by the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology in Warsaw, Poland, and consists of EEG recordings from 14 patients with schizophrenia and 14 healthy controls. The details include the duration of the recordings, the number of electrodes used, and the sampling rate.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as being collected by the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology, but I need to ensure I have the complete citation for this source.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: EEG Dataset for Schizophrenia Detection
   - **Description**: This dataset consists of EEG recordings from 14 schizophrenia patients and 14 age-matched healthy control subjects. The recordings were taken during a 15-minute eyes-closed resting state, using 19 electrodes placed according to the international 10-20 system, with a sampling rate of 250 Hz.
   - **Citation**: 
     > Olejarczyk, E., & Jernajczyk, W. (2017). Graph-based analysis of brain connectivity in schizophrenia. *PloS one*, 12(11), e0188629.

Now, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details about the dataset, including its name, description, and citation. This will allow me to present the information in a structured manner for further processing or review.
