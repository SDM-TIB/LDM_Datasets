To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Three-dimensional Convolutional-Recurrent Network for Convective Storm Nowcasting" by Wei Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of "real-time re-analysis of meteorological data supplied by numerical models" and specifically reference the **Variational Doppler Radar Analysis System (VDRAS)**. This indicates that there is a dataset related to meteorological data, but I need to find more specific details.

Next, I will look into the **data preprocessing section** (Section III) where the authors describe the radar reflectivity data and the re-analyzed meteorological data. They mention that the radar reflectivity data (R data) are sourced from the **KFTG WSR-88D radar of Denver (CO, USA)**. This is a crucial dataset for the study.

The authors also state that the re-analyzed meteorological data are from the **VDRAS**, which is essential for understanding the atmospheric dynamics involved in the study. They specify that the data includes information from **seven historical heavy rainfall events** occurring on specific dates, which is important for dataset documentation.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For the **KFTG WSR-88D radar data**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation, it is generally recognized as part of the National Weather Service's radar network. I will note this as a source of radar data.

2. For the **VDRAS**, the citation is:
   > Sun, J., Xue, M., Wilson, J. W., Zawadzki, I., Ballard, S. P., Onvlee-Hooimeyer, J., Joe, P., Barker, D. M., Li, P., Golding, B., Xu, M., & Pinto, J. (2014). Use of NWP for Nowcasting Convective Precipitation: Recent Progress and Challenges. *Bulletin of American Meteorological Society*, 95(3), 409-426.

Next, I will summarize the datasets identified:

- **Radar Reflectivity Data**: Sourced from the KFTG WSR-88D radar of Denver, CO, USA. This dataset is crucial for nowcasting convective storms.

- **VDRAS Meteorological Data**: This dataset includes re-analyzed meteorological data that provide valuable information about atmospheric dynamics.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets with their respective citations, ready for further processing or review.
