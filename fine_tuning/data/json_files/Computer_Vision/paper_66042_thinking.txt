To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural-based Compression Scheme for Solar Image Data" by Ali Zafari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a neural network-based compression method for data from NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), which suggests that there may be specific datasets related to this mission.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the SDO mission and the data it collects, which includes solar images at various wavelengths. This section may provide insights into the specific datasets used in their experiments.

I will then look into **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset they utilized. In this section, they mention that the dataset consists of SDO images taken at different wavelengths (94, 131, 171, 193, 211, 304, 335, 1600, and 1700 Å) with a cadence of 6 minutes. They also describe how they temporally downsampled the images to a cadence of 1 hour and divided the dataset based on the month to prevent biases.

The authors provide the total number of training images (21,416) and test images (8,257), which confirms the dataset's size and structure.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The dataset is derived from the work of Galvez et al. (2019), which is referenced in the paper. The citation for this dataset is:

- Galvez, R., Fouhey, D. F., Jin, M., Szenicer, A., Muñoz-Jaramillo, A., Cheung, M. C. M., Wright, P. J., Bobra, M. G., Liu, Y., Mason, J., & Thomas, R. (2019). A machine-learning data set prepared from the NASA solar dynamics observatory mission. *The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series*, 240(2), 22. doi:10.3847/1538-4365/ab1005.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: SDO Solar Image Dataset
   - **Description**: The dataset includes images of the sun at various wavelengths (94, 131, 171, 193, 211, 304, 335, 1600, and 1700 Å) collected by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The images were temporally downsampled to a cadence of 1 hour, with a total of 21,416 training images and 8,257 test images.
   - **Full Citation**: Galvez, R., Fouhey, D. F., Jin, M., Szenicer, A., Muñoz-Jaramillo, A., Cheung, M. C. M., Wright, P. J., Bobra, M. G., Liu, Y., Mason, J., & Thomas, R. (2019). A machine-learning data set prepared from the NASA solar dynamics observatory mission. *The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series*, 240(2), 22. doi:10.3847/1538-4365/ab1005.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
