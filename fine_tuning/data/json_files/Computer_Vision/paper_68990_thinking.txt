To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Chaos-Based Bitwise Dynamical Pseudorandom Number Generator on FPGA" by Miguel Garcia-Bosque et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a new pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) based on the logistic map, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. 

Next, I will examine the **implementation results and comparison sections** to see if any datasets are referenced. In this paper, the authors focus on the performance of their proposed PRNG and its implementation on an FPGA, but they do not provide specific datasets used for training or testing in the traditional sense, as this paper is more focused on algorithm performance rather than empirical datasets.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references. The references include various papers that discuss PRNGs and their applications, but they do not specifically mention datasets that were used in the experiments of this paper.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets or provide citations for datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this particular research paper.

In summary, I will note that while the paper discusses the implementation and performance of a PRNG, it does not provide any datasets for extraction or citation. Therefore, I will not create any dataset entries as there are none to report.
