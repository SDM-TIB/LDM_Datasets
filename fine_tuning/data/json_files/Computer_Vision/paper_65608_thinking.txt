To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Diffusion GAN Model for Symbolic Music Generation Controlled by Emotions" by Jincheng Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a symbolic music dataset with emotion labels, which suggests that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Method)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention the **multi-modal EMOPIA dataset**, which contains audio data and transcribed MIDI files of 1,087 pop piano music clips extracted from 387 songs, along with discrete emotion labels corresponding to the four quadrants of Russellâ€™s circumplex model of affect.

I will note the details provided about the dataset, including the number of clips, the type of data (audio and MIDI), and the emotion labels. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset's contents and its relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the EMOPIA dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- For the **EMOPIA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hsiao-Tzu Hung, Joann Ching, Seungheon Doh, Nabin Kim, Juhan Nam, and Yi-Hsuan Yang. *Emopia: A multi-modal pop piano dataset for emotion recognition and emotion-based music generation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2108.01374, 2021.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citation as it is crucial for proper attribution.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that it is clear and includes all necessary details for future reference or processing.
