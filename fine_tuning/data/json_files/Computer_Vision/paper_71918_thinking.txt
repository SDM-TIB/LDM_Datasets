To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LetsGo: Large-Scale Garage Modeling and Rendering via LiDAR-Assisted Gaussian Primitives" by Jiadi Cui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the **GarageWorld dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Garage Data Capture)**, where the authors describe the data collection process and the specifics of the dataset. Here, they mention that the **GarageWorld dataset** consists of eight garages with various structures, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's scope.

In **subsection 3.2 (GarageWorld Dataset)**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the garages included in the dataset, such as their geometric features, area sizes, and lighting conditions. This section is essential for extracting the dataset's characteristics.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if the authors reference any other datasets used for comparison or validation. They mention using **ScanNet++** and **KITTI-360** datasets alongside GarageWorld, which indicates that these datasets are also relevant to the research.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **GarageWorld Dataset**: The citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is described as a dataset created by the authors for their research. Therefore, I will note it as:
   > Cui, J., Cao, J., Zhao, F., He, Z., Chen, Y., Zhong, Y., Xu, L., Shi, Y., Zhang, Y., & Yu, J. (2023). *GarageWorld: A dataset for large-scale garage modeling and rendering*. [Dataset description provided in the paper].

2. **ScanNet++ Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Dai, A., Chang, A. X., Savva, M., Halber, M., Funkhouser, T., & Nießner, M. (2017). *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 5828–5839.

3. **KITTI-360 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Liao, Y., Xie, J., & Geiger, A. (2022). *KITTI-360: A novel dataset and benchmarks for urban scene understanding in 2D and 3D*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 45(3), 3292–3310.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its citation for future reference. This will facilitate any further analysis or application of the datasets in related research.
