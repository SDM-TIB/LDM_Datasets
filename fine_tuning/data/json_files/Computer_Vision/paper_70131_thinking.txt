To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Graph Generator: Feature-Conditioned Graph Generation using Latent Diffusion Models" by Iakovos Evdaimon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the need for a dataset of graphs that exhibit specific properties for training their model. This indicates that a dataset is indeed involved, but I need to find the specifics.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they state that they trained and evaluated the Neural Graph Generator (NGG) model on a dataset containing **1 million synthetic graphs**. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their model.

The paper also specifies that the dataset consists of graphs generated from **17 different families of graphs**, including paths, cycles, Erdős–Rényi random graphs, and Barabási–Albert graphs, among others. This detailed description of the dataset types is important for understanding the diversity and applicability of the dataset.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. However, since the dataset is synthetic and generated by the authors, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note that the dataset is described in detail within the paper itself.

The authors also provide a link to their GitHub repository where the dataset and additional resources are available. This is important for anyone interested in accessing the dataset for their own research.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and any relevant citations or links. The key points to include are:

1. **Dataset Name**: Synthetic Graph Dataset
2. **Description**: A dataset containing 1 million synthetic graphs generated from 17 different families of graphs, used for training and evaluating the Neural Graph Generator model.
3. **Citation**: Since this dataset is not formally published, I will note that it is described in the paper and provide the GitHub link for access.

Now, I will prepare to format this information appropriately for downstream processing or review.
