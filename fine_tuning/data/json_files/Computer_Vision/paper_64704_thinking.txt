To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative Escher Meshes" by Noam Aigerman and Thibault Groueix, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and often includes key datasets used in the study. In this case, the abstract mentions a method for generating textured 2D shapes, but does not explicitly list any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. I will look for any specific datasets that the authors used to validate their method. In this paper, the authors describe their method's application to various prompts, but they do not explicitly mention any standard datasets.

I will also check the **figures and tables** throughout the paper, as they may contain visual representations or summaries of datasets used. Figures 1 through 24 showcase the results of the method applied to various prompts, but again, they do not reference any specific datasets.

After reviewing the main sections of the paper, I will consult the **references section** to identify any datasets that may have been cited indirectly through other works. I will look for any references that discuss datasets related to 2D tiling or generative methods, as these may provide context or foundational datasets that the authors built upon.

If I find any datasets mentioned in the references, I will ensure to extract the full citation for each dataset. For example, if the authors reference a foundational work that introduced a dataset, I will include that citation as part of my dataset extraction.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. If no specific datasets are found, I will note that the paper primarily focuses on a novel method rather than on existing datasets.

In summary, my steps will include:
1. Reading the abstract, introduction, and methods sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Examining the experiments section for explicit dataset details.
3. Checking figures and tables for any dataset references.
4. Reviewing the references section for any cited datasets.
5. Compiling the findings into a structured format with full citations.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of any datasets mentioned in the paper, along with their proper citations.
