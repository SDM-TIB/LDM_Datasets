To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SSM Meets Video Diffusion Models: Efficient Video Generation with Structured State Spaces" by Yuta Oshima et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their model on **UCF101** and **MineRL Navigate**, indicating that these are the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors provide a clear description of the datasets:

1. **UCF101**: This dataset is described as a standard benchmark for video generation, consisting of 13,320 videos from various action classes. The authors mention that they sampled clips with frame lengths of 16 and downscaled their spatial resolution to 32 × 32 pixels or 64 × 64 pixels.

2. **MineRL Navigate**: This dataset includes 961 videos, each with 500 frames, and is used to validate the model's performance with longer video sequences. The authors explore frame lengths of 64, 200, and 400 frames, also downscaled to 32 × 32 pixels.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **UCF101**, the citation is:
  > Soomro, K., Zamir, A. R., & Shah, M. (2012). *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402.

- For **MineRL Navigate**, the citation is:
  > Guss, W. H., Houghton, B., Topin, N., Wang, P., Codel, C., Veloso, M., & Salakhutdinov, R. (2019). *MineRL: A large-scale dataset of Minecraft demonstrations*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.13440.

Having gathered this information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
