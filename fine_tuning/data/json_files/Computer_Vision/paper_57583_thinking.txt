To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OCR-RTPS: An OCR-based real-time positioning system for the valet parking" by Zizhang Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the results were tested on both public datasets and a self-collected dataset, indicating that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the limitations of existing positioning systems and the need for their proposed method. They mention the establishment of a new dataset, which suggests that it is significant for their research.

I will then focus on **section 4 (Parking OCR Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they created. Here, they describe the data collection process, the characteristics of the dataset, and its intended use. The key points include:

1. **Parking OCR Dataset**: This dataset was created specifically for parking scene text recognition. It consists of over 18,000 images with 16,744 annotated text instances. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets with a ratio of 7:2:1.

In this section, the authors also provide insights into the diversity of the dataset, including the various conditions under which the data was collected (e.g., different cities, lighting conditions, and text cases).

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Parking OCR Dataset. Since the dataset is newly established and not previously published, the citation will be based on the paper itself. The citation for the dataset will be:

> Zizhang Wu, Xinyuan Chen, Jizheng Wang, Xiaoquan Wang, Yuanzhu Gan, Muqing Fang, and Tianhao Xu. *OCR-RTPS: An OCR-based real-time positioning system for the valet parking*. In Proceedings of the [insert conference name], [insert page numbers], 2021.

Now, I will compile the extracted dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Parking OCR Dataset. This will allow for proper attribution and reference in any future work or discussions regarding this research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and completeness.
