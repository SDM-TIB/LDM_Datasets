To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Model of Semantic Completion in Generative Episodic Memory" by Zahra Fayyaz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions using images of digits (MNIST) augmented by different backgrounds, which indicates that the MNIST dataset is a key dataset in this research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods and results sections**. In the results section, the authors explicitly state that they use the **MNIST dataset** for their simulations, which is a well-known dataset of handwritten digits. They describe it as containing images of digits normalized between 0 and 1 and sized at 28 Ã— 28 pixels.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation for the MNIST dataset is:

- **MNIST Dataset**: 
  > Yann LeCun. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. 1998. Available from: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the MNIST dataset and does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MNIST dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. 

After completing this process, I will have a clear and structured output that includes the dataset information along with the necessary citations for further reference.
