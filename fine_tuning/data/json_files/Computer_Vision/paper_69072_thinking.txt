To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Democratizing the Creation of Animatable Facial Avatars" by Yilin Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a high-level overview of the research and may mention any datasets used or referenced. In this case, the introduction discusses the challenges of creating personalized avatars and hints at the use of various technologies, but it does not explicitly name any datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** within the paper. This section typically outlines the datasets used in the experiments or evaluations. If such a section exists, it will likely provide detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their purpose, size, and any specific characteristics. 

If there is no dedicated section, I will search through the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections often describe the experimental setup and may reference datasets used for training or evaluation. I will pay close attention to any mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and any other relevant details for each dataset.

For example, if I find that the paper references a dataset like the "MetaHuman database," I will look for its citation in the references section. If the dataset is publicly available, I will also note the URL or DOI if provided.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the details, including the full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Look for a dedicated datasets section or search through methodology and experiments for dataset references.
3. Check the references section for full citations of each identified dataset.
4. Compile the dataset information and citations for further use.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and accurate extraction of datasets from the paper.
