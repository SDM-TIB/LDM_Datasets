To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Simple-but-effective Baseline for Training-free Class-Agnostic Counting" by Yuhao Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on two datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present. I will look for specific names and details of these datasets.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **FSC-147**: This dataset is described as the first extensive Class-Agnostic Counting (CAC) dataset, containing 6,135 images across 147 categories, with specific splits for training, validation, and testing.

2. **CARPK**: This dataset consists of 1,448 images of car parks captured from drones, and the authors mention that they focus on the test set for evaluation.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **FSC-147**, the citation is:
  > Viresh Ranjan, Udbhav Sharma, Thu Nguyen, and Minh Hoai. *Learning to count everything*. In CVPR, pages 3394–3403, 2021.

- For **CARPK**, the citation is:
  > Meng-Ru Hsieh, Yen-Liang Lin, and Winston H Hsu. *Drone-based object counting by spatially regularized regional proposal network*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 4145–4153, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
