To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-adjusting optimization algorithm for solving the set-union knapsack problem" by Congcong Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention any datasets used for validation. In this case, the abstract discusses experimental comparisons on benchmark sets, indicating that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section** to see if the authors reference specific datasets or benchmark instances. The introduction mentions various algorithms and their applications but does not explicitly name datasets. However, it does refer to the set-union knapsack problem (SUKP) and its applications, which suggests that datasets related to SUKP might be discussed later.

I will then examine **section 4 (Simulation and evaluation)**, where the authors describe the experimental setup. Here, they mention that they performed experimental comparisons on **30 benchmark instances** generated according to specific rules. The instances are named in a structured format (sukp m_n_α_β), where m is the number of items, n is the number of elements, α is the density of the elements, and β is the ratio of capacity to the total weight of the elements. This indicates that the datasets are these benchmark instances.

The authors also provide a link to download these benchmark instances: **http://sncet.com/ThreetypesofSUKPinstances(EAs).rar**. This is crucial information for documenting the dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets. The authors reference several papers that discuss the SUKP and its variants, but they do not provide specific citations for the benchmark datasets themselves. However, I will note the relevant references that discuss the algorithms and methodologies used in the context of SUKP.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets:

1. **Benchmark Instances for SUKP**: These are the 30 benchmark instances used for experimental comparisons. They are structured as sukp m_n_α_β, where:
   - m = number of items
   - n = number of elements
   - α = density of elements
   - β = ratio of capacity to total weight of elements
   - The datasets can be accessed at: http://sncet.com/ThreetypesofSUKPinstances(EAs).rar

Since there are no specific citations for these datasets in the references, I will note that they are derived from the authors' experimental setup and the provided link.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to format them according to the required structure, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper itself as the source of the datasets.

The citation for the paper is:
> Congcong Wu, Xiangyun Gao, Xueyong Liu, Bowen Sun. *Self-adjusting optimization algorithm for solving the set-union knapsack problem*. 

With this information, I am ready to create the dataset entries as needed.
