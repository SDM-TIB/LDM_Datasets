To extract datasets from the research paper titled "URCDM: Ultra-Resolution Image Synthesis in Histopathology" by Sarah Cechnicka et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on three separate datasets, which is a clear indication that I need to look for specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **Evaluation and Results** section, particularly where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **GLIOMA Dataset**: This dataset is described as the public low-grade glioma dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) archive, containing 344 Whole Slide Images (WSIs).

2. **BREAST Dataset**: This dataset is identified as the public TCGA Breast Invasive Carcinoma dataset, comprising 1978 high-resolution WSIs of various tissues.

3. **KIDNEY Dataset**: The authors refer to a proprietary collection of 428 Kidney Transplant Pathology WSI slides, with an average resolution of 40,000 Ã— 40,000 pixels per slide.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For the **GLIOMA Dataset**:
  > The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. *The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer Analysis Project*. Nature Publishing Group, 2013. https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.2764.

- For the **BREAST Dataset**:
  > Weinstein, J.N., Collisson, E.A., Mills, G.B., Shaw, K.R.M., Ozenberger, B.A., Ellrott, K., Shmulevich, I., Sander, C., Stuart, J.M. *The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer Analysis Project*. Nature Publishing Group, 2013. https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.2764.

- For the **KIDNEY Dataset**: Since this is a proprietary dataset, it may not have a formal citation like the public datasets. However, I will note it as a proprietary collection without a specific citation.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
