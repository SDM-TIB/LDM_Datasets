To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Outdoor Monocular Depth Estimation: A Research Review" by Pulkit Vyas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the paper provides an overview of available datasets for outdoor depth estimation, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Datasets)**, as this section is likely dedicated to detailing the datasets used or reviewed in the paper. Here, the authors categorize datasets into generic outdoor datasets, panoramic datasets, and generative methods. 

In the **Generic outdoor datasets subsection**, the following datasets are mentioned:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: The paper describes this dataset as the most used reference for outdoor scenes taken from a moving vehicle, with specific details about the number of training and test images.

2. **Make3D Dataset**: This dataset is noted for its inclusion of cityscapes and natural landscapes, with a total of 53 pairs of RGBD images.

3. **Newer College Dataset**: Mentioned briefly, this dataset is collected using handheld LiDAR and other sensors.

4. **Megadepth Dataset**: This dataset is referenced for its depth estimation capabilities.

5. **DIODE Dataset**: Another dataset mentioned for its relevance to depth estimation.

6. **DrivingStereo Dataset**: This dataset is noted for stereo matching in autonomous driving scenarios.

In the **Panoramic datasets subsection**, the following datasets are highlighted:

1. **Multi-FoV (Urban Canyon) Dataset**: This dataset is collected using panoramic cameras.

2. **ETH3D Dataset**: Mentioned for its high-resolution images and corresponding depth maps.

3. **Forest Virtual Dataset**: Another panoramic dataset referenced in the context of depth estimation.

In the **Generative methods subsection**, the paper discusses:

1. **FarSight**: A method for generating long-range outdoor images and annotated depth maps using images from Google Earth.

2. **KITTI to Panoramic Dataset Adaptation**: This approach adapts the KITTI dataset for use with 360-degree cameras.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
