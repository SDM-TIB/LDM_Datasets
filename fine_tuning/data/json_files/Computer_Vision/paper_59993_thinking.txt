To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Desynchronization-Based Countermeasure Against Side-Channel Analysis of Neural Networks" by Jakub Breier et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of a proposed countermeasure against side-channel attacks, but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Timing Analysis of Activation Functions)** and **section 5 (Leakage Assessment of a Neuron Computation)**, as these sections may contain experimental setups that utilize specific datasets. In section 3.1, the authors mention using a **NewAE ChipWhisperer tool** for power analysis, but they do not specify a dataset used for the timing analysis of activation functions.

In section 5, the authors describe the use of a **Test Vector Leakage Assessment (TVLA)** method, but again, there is no mention of a specific dataset. They refer to using fixed vs. random inputs for their experiments, but these do not constitute a formal dataset with a citation.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets with full citations, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are referenced indirectly through other works. However, the references primarily cite previous research on side-channel analysis and neural networks, rather than specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no formal datasets provided with citations. The authors focus on experimental methods and results rather than on specific datasets used in their experiments.

In conclusion, I will document that no datasets were explicitly mentioned in the paper, and therefore, there are no citations to provide. This will be important for clarity in any further analysis or reporting on the paper's content.
