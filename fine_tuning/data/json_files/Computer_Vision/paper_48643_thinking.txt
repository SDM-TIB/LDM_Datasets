To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DASVDD: Deep Autoencoding Support Vector Data Descriptor for Anomaly Detection" by Hadi Hojjati and Narges Armanfard, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on several benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention five datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of 70,000 monochrome images of handwritten digits, each of size 28x28 pixels.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset contains 60,000 color images of size 32x32 pixels, categorized into 10 different classes.

3. **Fashion MNIST Dataset**: Similar to MNIST, this dataset has 70,000 grayscale images of size 28x28 pixels, but it represents 10 different fashion products.

4. **ODDS Speech Dataset**: This dataset includes 3,686 segments of English speech, represented by a 400-dimensional feature vector called I-vector, with a majority labeled as normal and a small percentage as anomalies.

5. **PIMA Dataset**: A subset of the Pima Indians diabetes dataset from the UCI repository, containing 765 samples with 8 attributes, where 268 samples are labeled as anomalies.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **MNIST Dataset**:
  > Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. 2010. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*. Available: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
