To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Score-Based Model for Learning Neural Wavefunctions" by Xuan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on quantum harmonic traps and atomic systems, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) to find specific datasets used for evaluation. In section 4.1, the authors mention conducting experiments on quantum harmonic traps and atomic systems, but I need to look for specific dataset names or references.

In section 4.1, the authors describe their experiments with quantum harmonic traps and atomic systems, but they do not provide specific dataset names. However, they mention that they will release their code after the review process, which may imply that the datasets used are either publicly available or will be included in their code release.

I will also check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited. The references include various works related to quantum systems and neural networks, but they do not explicitly mention datasets. 

Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names or citations, I will note that the authors refer to their experiments with quantum harmonic traps and atomic systems but do not provide formal dataset citations. 

In conclusion, I will document the findings as follows:

1. **Quantum Harmonic Trap**: The authors conducted experiments on quantum harmonic traps, but no specific dataset citation is provided.
2. **Atomic Systems**: The authors mention experiments on atomic systems (e.g., Boron, Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen), but again, no specific dataset citation is provided.

Since there are no formal dataset citations in the paper, I will note that the datasets may be part of the code release after the review process.

Now, I will summarize the findings without a structured JSON output, as the paper does not provide explicit dataset citations.
