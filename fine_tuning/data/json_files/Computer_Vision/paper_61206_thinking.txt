To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DiffusionNER: Boundary Diffusion for Named Entity Recognition" by Yongliang Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the experiments were conducted on multiple flat and nested NER datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **ACE04**: A nested NER dataset that contains 7 entity categories, including PER, ORG, LOC, GPE, WEA, FAC, and VEH. The authors reference the original paper by Doddington et al. (2004) for this dataset.

2. **ACE05**: Another nested NER dataset, similar to ACE04, and it is referenced with the original paper by Walker et al. (2006).

3. **GENIA**: A biology-focused nested NER dataset with 5 entity types, referenced from Ohta et al. (2002).

4. **CoNLL03**: A flat NER dataset with 4 types of named entities, referenced from Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder (2003).

5. **OntoNotes**: A flat dataset with 18 types of named entities, referenced from Pradhan et al. (2013).

6. **MSRA**: A Chinese flat dataset with 3 entity types, referenced from Levow (2006).

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For **ACE04**, the citation is:
  > George Doddington, Alexis Mitchell, Mark Przybocki, Lance Ramshaw, Stephanie Strassel, and Ralph Weischedel. *The automatic content extraction (ACE) program – tasks, data, and evaluation*. In Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’04), Lisbon, Portugal, 2004.

- For **ACE05**, the citation is:

- For **GENIA**, the citation is:
  > Tomoko Ohta, Yuka Tateisi, and Jin-Dong Kim. *The genia corpus: An annotated research abstract corpus in molecular biology domain*. In Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Human Language Technology Research, San Francisco, USA, 2002.

- For **CoNLL03**, the citation is:

- For **OntoNotes**, the citation is:
  > Sameer Pradhan, Alessandro Moschitti, Nianwen Xue, Hwee Tou Ng, Anders Björkelund, Olga Uryupina, Yuchen Zhang, and Zhi Zhong. *Towards robust linguistic analysis using OntoNotes*. In Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning, pages 143–152, 2013.

  > Gina-Anne Levow. *The third international Chinese language processing bakeoff: Word segmentation and named entity recognition*. In Proceedings of the Fifth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing, pages 108–117, 2006.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
