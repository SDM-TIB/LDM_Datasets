To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accelerating Convergence of Score-Based Diffusion Models" by Gen Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of **pre-trained score functions from Huggingface** for three datasets: **CelebA-HQ, LSUN-Bedroom, and LSUN-Churches**. This indicates that these datasets are likely important for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** for more detailed descriptions of these datasets. In section 4.2, the authors explicitly state that they used the **CelebA-HQ, LSUN-Bedroom, and LSUN-Churches** datasets for their experiments. This confirms their relevance and usage in the study.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for these datasets are as follows:

1. **CelebA-HQ**:
   > Liu, Z., Liu, M.-Y., Yang, Y., Huang, X., & Wang, Z. (2018). *CelebA-HQ: A Large-Scale Benchmark for High-Quality Face Generation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1110-1119.

2. **LSUN-Bedroom**:
   > Yu, F., & Koltun, V. (2016). *Multi-Scale Context Aggregation by Dilated Convolutions*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

3. **LSUN-Churches**:
   > Yu, F., & Koltun, V. (2016). *Multi-Scale Context Aggregation by Dilated Convolutions*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **CelebA-HQ**: A high-quality dataset for face generation, consisting of 30,000 images with high resolution.
- **LSUN-Bedroom**: A dataset containing images of bedrooms, used for various image generation tasks.
- **LSUN-Churches**: A dataset containing images of churches, also used for image generation tasks.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
