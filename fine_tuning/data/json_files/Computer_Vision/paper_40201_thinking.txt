To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Explaining Machine Learning Models by Evolving Crucial and Compact Features" by Marco Virgolin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention the datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the datasets and their relevance to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. This section usually includes the number of datasets, their characteristics, and how they are applied in the context of the study. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as they often contain crucial information.

In this paper, the authors mention using **21 datasets** for classification and regression problems. I will note down the names of these datasets and any relevant details provided, such as the number of features, examples, and classes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source for the datasets used in the research. I will ensure to extract the complete citation format as presented in the paper.

For example, if the authors mention using the **Iris dataset**, I will look for its citation, which typically includes the authors, title, publication venue, and year. I will do this for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and attributed to its original source. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further studies.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets from the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and proper citation.
