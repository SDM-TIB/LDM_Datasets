To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learnable Heterogeneous Convolution: Learning both topology and strength" by Rongzhen Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context of the research and may reference specific datasets that are relevant to the study.

Next, I will pay close attention to the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors discuss the performance of their method on **CIFAR10** and **ImageNet** datasets. I will note these datasets as they are crucial for understanding the context of the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. It is important to provide complete citations to ensure proper attribution and allow others to access the datasets easily.

For the **CIFAR10 dataset**, the citation is:
> Alex, K., Sutskever, I., & Hinton, G. E. (2012). Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks. In Advances in neural information processing systems 25.

For the **ImageNet dataset**, the citation is:
> Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
