To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Application of machine learning algorithms in classifying postoperative success in metabolic bariatric surgery: A comprehensive study" by José Alberto Benítez-Andrades et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves a dataset of 73 patients, which suggests that there is a specific dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the dataset was obtained from a retrospective review of clinical data from patients who underwent metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS). The dataset consists of 73 patients who completed a one-year follow-up and includes various variables categorized into socio-economic, psychometric, and analytical groups.

In the **dataset description**, the authors specify that the dataset includes:
1. **Socio-economic variables**: Gender, age, employment status, and educational level.
2. **Psychometric variables**: Various scales and questionnaires assessing psychiatric history and current disorders.
3. **Analytical variables**: Blood test results including hemoglobin, glucose, cholesterol, and other relevant health metrics.

The paper also notes that the dataset was sourced from the Complejo Asistencial Universitario de León and converted from Excel to CSV format.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from clinical data and not a standalone published dataset, it may not have a formal citation like traditional datasets. Instead, I will note the source as the Complejo Asistencial Universitario de León.

The citation for the dataset can be summarized as follows:
- **Dataset**: Clinical dataset of patients who underwent metabolic and bariatric surgery.
- **Source**: Complejo Asistencial Universitario de León, Spain.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset, ensuring to include the source and any relevant details that can help in understanding the dataset's context and usage in the study. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the dataset's details and provide proper attribution.
