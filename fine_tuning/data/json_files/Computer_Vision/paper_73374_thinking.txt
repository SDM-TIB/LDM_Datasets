To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Benchmarking and Improving Bird’s Eye View Perception Robustness in Autonomous Driving" by Shaoyuan Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates the introduction of a benchmark suite called **RoboBEV**, which suggests that there may be datasets associated with this benchmark.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Benchmark Design)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset Generation)**, where the authors describe the creation of the **nuScenes-C benchmark dataset**. This section details how the dataset was generated by introducing various corruptions to the validation set of the **nuScenes dataset**. 

The authors mention that the **nuScenes-C dataset** consists of 866,736 images with a resolution of 1600×900 pixels, which is crucial information for documenting the dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **nuScenes dataset**, as it is the original dataset from which the nuScenes-C dataset is derived. The citation for the nuScenes dataset is:

- **nuScenes Dataset**:
  > H. Caesar, V. Bankiti, A. H. Lang, S. Vora, V. E. Liong, Q. Xu, A. Krishnan, Y. Pan, G. Baldan, and O. Beijbom. *nuScenes: A Multimodal Dataset for Autonomous Driving*. In IEEE/CVF Conf. Comput. Vis. Pattern Recog., 2020, pp. 11 621–11 631.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

1. **nuScenes-C Dataset**: A benchmark dataset created by introducing various corruptions to the validation set of the nuScenes dataset, consisting of 866,736 images with a resolution of 1600×900 pixels.

2. **nuScenes Dataset**: The original dataset used to generate the nuScenes-C dataset, which includes multimodal data for autonomous driving tasks.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
