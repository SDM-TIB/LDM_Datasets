To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ID-to-3D: Expressive ID-guided 3D Heads via Score Distillation Sampling" by Francesca Babiloni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the method does not rely on large 3D captured datasets, which suggests that there may be smaller datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention using the **NHPM dataset** (Neural Head Parameter Model), which is crucial for their method. I will look for details about this dataset, such as its size, content, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the NHPM dataset is referenced multiple times, particularly in the context of training the 2D guidance models. The authors state that it consists of 255 subjects and 23 facial expressions, which is important information to include.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the NHPM dataset. The citation is typically formatted according to the conventions of the conference or journal, and it is essential to provide this for proper attribution.

The citation for the NHPM dataset is:
> Giebenhain, S., Kirschstein, T., Georgopoulos, M., Rünz, M., Agapito, L., & Nießner, M. (2023). Learning neural parametric head models. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 21003–21012.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details, including the name, description, and citation, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further, ensuring that all necessary information is included and accurately represented.
