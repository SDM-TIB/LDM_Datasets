To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Language Model Decoding as Direct Metrics Optimization" by Pei Ke et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention evaluating their method on the **Wikipedia and News domains** for open-ended text generation. This indicates that these are the primary datasets used in their experiments.

I will then look for any additional details about these datasets, such as their sources, sizes, or specific characteristics. The authors mention that the Wikipedia data comes from the **Wikitext-103 corpus** and that the News data comes from **Wikinews**. This is crucial information that I need to capture.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. For the Wikitext-103 corpus, the citation is:
> Merity, S., Keskar, N. S., & Socher, R. (2017). *Pointer sentinel mixture models*. In Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2017). 

For the Wikinews dataset, I will note that it is a publicly available dataset, but it may not have a formal citation like a journal article. Instead, I can reference it as follows:
> Wikinews. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.wikinews.org.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations in a structured format for clarity and completeness.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
