To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3D Former: Monocular Scene Reconstruction with 3D SDF Transformers" by Weihao Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experiments are conducted on "multiple datasets," which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) to find specific mentions of datasets used for evaluation. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on the **ScanNet dataset**, which is a large-scale indoor dataset composed of RGB-D videos. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

I will also look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. In section 4.1, the authors reference **TUM-RGBD** and **ICL-NUIM** datasets as well, indicating that these datasets were used for generalization evaluation. 

Now, I will gather the full citations for each of these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **ScanNet Dataset**:
   > Dai, A., Chang, A. X., Savva, M., Halber, M., Funkhouser, T., & NieÃŸner, M. (2017). *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.

2. **TUM-RGBD Dataset**:
   > Sturm, J., Engelhard, J., Endres, F., Burgard, W., & Cremers, D. (2012). *A benchmark for the evaluation of RGB-D SLAM systems*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems.

3. **ICL-NUIM Dataset**:
   > Handa, A., Whelan, T., McDonald, J. B., & Davison, A. J. (2014). *A benchmark for RGB-D visual odometry, 3D reconstruction and SLAM*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- **ScanNet Dataset** with citation.
- **TUM-RGBD Dataset** with citation.
- **ICL-NUIM Dataset** with citation.

This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
