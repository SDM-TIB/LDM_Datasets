To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Progressive Multi-modal Conditional Prompt Tuning" by Xiaoyu Qiu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for a subsection specifically dedicated to datasets, as this is where the authors usually describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using **11 datasets** for their evaluations, which is a strong indication that I need to extract detailed information about each one.

Next, I will identify the datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors list the following datasets:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset widely used for image classification tasks.
2. **Caltech101**: A dataset containing images of 101 object categories.
3. **OxfordPets**: A dataset for classifying pet breeds.
4. **StanfordCars**: A dataset for fine-grained classification of car models.
5. **Flowers102**: A dataset containing images of flowers across 102 categories.
6. **Food101**: A dataset with images of food items across 101 categories.
7. **FGVCAircraft**: A dataset for fine-grained classification of aircraft.
8. **SUN397**: A dataset for scene recognition with 397 categories.
9. **DTD**: A dataset for texture classification.
10. **EuroSAT**: A dataset for land use and land cover classification.
11. **UCF101**: A dataset for action recognition in videos.

I will then check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each of these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, the citation for **ImageNet** is:
> Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255, 2009.

I will repeat this process for each dataset, ensuring that I accurately capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their descriptions and full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive and well-documented extraction of datasets from the research paper.
