To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Denoising Diffusion Semantic Segmentation with Mask Prior Modeling" by Zeqiang Lai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on **ADE20K and Cityscapes**, indicating that these are the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.2, the authors provide results for both **ADE20K** and **Cityscapes**, confirming their use in the experiments. They discuss the performance of their model on these datasets, which further solidifies their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **ADE20K**: The citation is:
   > Bolei Zhou, Hang Zhao, Xavier Puig, Sanja Fidler, Adela Barriuso, and Antonio Torralba. *Scene parsing through ADE20K dataset*. In CVPR, pages 633â€“641, 2017.

2. **Cityscapes**: The citation is:
   > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **ADE20K**: A dataset for semantic segmentation that includes a wide variety of scenes and objects, providing a comprehensive benchmark for segmentation tasks.
- **Cityscapes**: A dataset focused on urban scene understanding, specifically designed for semantic segmentation in street scenes.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately represented for future reference or processing.
