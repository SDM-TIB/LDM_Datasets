To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mask-Guided Residual Diffusion Models for Scene Text Image Super-Resolution" by Baolin Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmark datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will likely be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments and results section**, specifically the **Datasets and Implementation Details** subsection. Here, the authors explicitly mention the **TextZoom dataset**, which is used for training and evaluation. The details provided include that the dataset consists of 17,367 low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) image pairs, with a breakdown of the test set into easy, medium, and hard subsets.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the TextZoom dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Wang, W.; Xie, E.; Li, X.; Hou, W.; Lu, T.; Yu, G.; and Shao, S. 2020. Scene text image super-resolution in the wild. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2020: 16th European Conference, Glasgow, UK, August 23–28, 2020, Proceedings, Part X 16, 650–666. Springer.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the **TextZoom dataset** is the primary dataset used in the experiments.

Now, I will summarize the findings for the dataset in a structured manner, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

1. **TextZoom Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for training and evaluation in the experiments. It consists of 17,367 LR-HR image pairs, with the test set divided into easy, medium, and hard subsets.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that is ready for further processing or review.
