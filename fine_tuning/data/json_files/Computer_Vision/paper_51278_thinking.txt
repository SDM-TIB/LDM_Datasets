To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learnable Faster Kernel-PCA for Nonlinear Fault Detection: Deep Autoencoder-Based Realization" by Zelin Ren et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of the **Tennessee Eastman (TE) process benchmark**, which indicates that this is a dataset relevant to the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the **Tennessee Eastman process** in the **experiments section**. Here, the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments, including the number of manipulated and measured variables, as well as the composition of the training, validation, and test datasets. They mention that the training dataset consists of **1168 normal samples** and the validation dataset consists of **292 normal samples**. The test dataset includes **21 faulty sets**, each containing **960 samples**.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Tennessee Eastman process dataset. The authors reference the TE process as a widely used benchmark in the field, and I will ensure to include the appropriate citation.

The citation for the Tennessee Eastman process is:
> Downs, J. J., & Vogel, E. F. (1993). *A plant-wide industrial process control problem*. Computers & Chemical Engineering, 17(3), 245-255.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation as required.

In summary, the steps I will take are:
1. Read through the relevant sections of the paper to identify datasets.
2. Document the details of the **Tennessee Eastman process** dataset, including its composition and purpose.
3. Retrieve and note the full citation for the dataset from the references section.
4. Prepare the dataset entry for further processing or review.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
