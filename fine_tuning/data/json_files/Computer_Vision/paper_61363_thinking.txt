To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PDE+: Enhancing Generalization via PDE with Adaptive Distributional Diffusion" by Yige Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through extensive experimental settings, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation. In this paper, the authors mention that they perform experiments on several datasets, including:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 color images in 10 classes, with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, containing 600 images per class.
3. **Tiny-ImageNet**: A dataset with 110,000 color images in 200 classes, with 550 images per class.
4. **CIFAR-10-C**: A corrupted version of CIFAR-10 with various types of corruptions applied.
5. **CIFAR-100-C**: A corrupted version of CIFAR-100.
6. **Tiny-ImageNet-C**: A corrupted version of Tiny-ImageNet.
7. **PACS**: A dataset used for domain generalization, consisting of images from four domains: photo, art, cartoon, and sketch.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details about the datasets, including specific characteristics or variations used in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers who may want to access these datasets.

The full citations I will extract for each dataset are as follows:

- **CIFAR-10**: 
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- **CIFAR-100**: 
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference.
