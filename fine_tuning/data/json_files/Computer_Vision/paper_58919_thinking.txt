To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Path Integral Based Convolution and Pooling for Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks" by Lingjie Kong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on a specific dataset, which is a good starting point. In the introduction, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsection titled **1.3 Dataset**. Here, the authors specifically mention the **ogbg-molhiv dataset**. I will carefully read the description provided to understand the dataset's characteristics, such as the number of graphs, the nature of the nodes and edges, and the task associated with the dataset.

The paper states that the ogbg-molhiv dataset contains 41,127 graphs representing molecules, with specific features for nodes and edges. This detailed description is crucial for accurately summarizing the dataset.

After identifying the dataset, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the ogbg-molhiv dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Weihua Hu, Matthias Fey, Marinka Zitnik, Yuxiao Dong, Hongyu Ren, Bowen Liu, Michele Catasta, and Jure Leskovec. *Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.00687, 2020.

Now that I have the dataset name, its description, and the full citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset's details.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and ready for presentation or further processing, maintaining a focus on clarity and completeness in the dataset description.
