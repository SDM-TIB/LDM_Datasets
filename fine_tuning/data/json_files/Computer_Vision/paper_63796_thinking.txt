To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VadCLIP: Adapting Vision-Language Models for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection" by Peng Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on two commonly-used benchmarks, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will note the names of these benchmarks for further investigation.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section**, specifically the **Datasets and Evaluation Metrics** subsection. Here, the authors explicitly mention the two datasets they used for their experiments:

1. **UCF-Crime**: This dataset is commonly used for video anomaly detection tasks. It contains a variety of abnormal events in surveillance videos, and the authors note that training videos only have video-level labels.

2. **XD-Violence**: Another dataset used for evaluating video anomaly detection methods, which also contains various types of violent events.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **UCF-Crime**, the citation is:
  > Sultani, W., Chen, C., & Shah, M. (2018). Real-world anomaly detection in surveillance videos. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 6479–6488.

- For **XD-Violence**, the citation is:
  > Wu, J., Zhang, W., Li, G., Wu, W., Tan, X., Li, Y., Ding, E., & Lin, L. (2021). Weakly-supervised spatio-temporal anomaly detection in surveillance video. arXiv preprint arXiv:2108.03825.

Now that I have the names and citations for both datasets, I will summarize the findings:

1. **UCF-Crime**: A dataset for video anomaly detection with video-level labels.
   - Citation: Sultani, W., Chen, C., & Shah, M. (2018). Real-world anomaly detection in surveillance videos. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 6479–6488.

2. **XD-Violence**: A dataset focused on violent events in videos, also used for anomaly detection.
   - Citation: Wu, J., Zhang, W., Li, G., Wu, W., Tan, X., Li, Y., Ding, E., & Lin, L. (2021). Weakly-supervised spatio-temporal anomaly detection in surveillance video. arXiv preprint arXiv:2108.03825.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that the dataset names and their full citations are clearly presented.
