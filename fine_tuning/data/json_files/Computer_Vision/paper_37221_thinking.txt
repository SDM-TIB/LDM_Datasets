To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Alternating optimization method based on nonnegative matrix factorizations for deep neural networks" by Tetsuya Sakurai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not detail specific datasets. The introduction might give context about the datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Performance evaluations)**, where the authors discuss their experimental results. Here, they mention using the **MNIST** and **CIFAR10** datasets for evaluating their proposed method. This is a crucial step as it confirms the datasets used in their experiments.

I will then look for any additional details about these datasets in the text. The authors provide some context about the datasets, such as their purpose and the specific configurations used during the experiments. However, they do not provide extensive descriptions or additional datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist.

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Computer Science Department, University of Toronto, Tech. Rep, 1 7 (2009).

Having gathered the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
