To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Disruption Detection for a Cognitive Digital Supply Chain Twin Using Hybrid Deep Learning" by Mahmoud Ashraf et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's purpose and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (System Implementation)**, where the authors describe the simulation model and data generation process. Here, they mention that five datasets are generated corresponding to different scenarios (S0, S1, S2, S3, S4). This indicates that the datasets are derived from a simulation model, which is crucial for understanding their context.

In **subsection 5.1.2 (Data Sets Generation)**, the authors detail how the datasets represent both normal and disrupted circumstances. They specify that each dataset consists of multivariate time series data with 916 time records per replication and thirteen parameters (features). This information is essential for describing the datasets.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. The authors reference previous studies and models that may have contributed to the datasets or methodologies used in their research.

The relevant citations I will extract include:

1. **Ashraf et al. (2022)**: This paper is referenced for the Time-To-Recovery prediction model and is crucial for understanding the context of the datasets used in this study. The citation is:
   > Ashraf, M., Eltawil, A., & Ali, I. (2022). Time-To-Recovery Prediction in a Disrupted Three-Echelon Supply Chain Using LSTM. IFAC-PapersOnLine, 55(10), 1319–1324. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ifacol.2022.09.573

2. **Buzacott et al. (1993)**: This reference is used for the closed-form model validation of the simulation model. The citation is:
   > Buzacott, J.A., & Shanthikumar, J.G. (1993). Stochastic Models of Manufacturing Systems. London: Prentice-Hall International.

3. **Ivanov & Dolgui (2020)**: This reference is important for understanding the digital supply chain twin framework. The citation is:
   > Ivanov, D., & Dolgui, A. (2020). A digital supply chain twin for managing the disruption risks and resilience in the era of Industry 4.0. Production Planning & Control, 32(9), 1–14. https://doi.org/10.1080/09537287.2020.1768450

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Dataset for Scenario S0**: Represents normal conditions in the supply chain.
2. **Dataset for Scenario S1**: Represents capacity loss at the supplier.
3. **Dataset for Scenario S2**: Represents capacity loss at the manufacturer.
4. **Dataset for Scenario S3**: Represents capacity loss at the distributor.
5. **Dataset for Scenario S4**: Represents a surge in demand.

Each dataset will be described in terms of its features and the context of its generation. Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and completeness.
