To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Human-Compatible Representations for Case-Based Decision Support" by Han Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may include references to datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 3) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the study.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Butterflies vs. Moths Dataset (BM)**: This dataset consists of images of four species of butterflies and moths, specifically the Peacock Butterfly, Ringlet Butterfly, Caterpillar Moth, and Tiger Moth. The authors state that they acquired 200 images from ImageNet for this binary classification task.

2. **Chest X-ray Dataset (CXR)**: This dataset is a balanced subset taken from the Kermany et al. (2018) dataset, containing 3,166 chest X-ray images labeled as either normal or pneumonia.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Butterflies vs. Moths Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Singla, A., Bogunovic, I., Bartók, G., Karbasi, A., & Krause, A. (2014). Near-optimally teaching the crowd to classify. In International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), pp. 154–162.

- For the **Chest X-ray Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kermany, D. S., Goldbaum, M., Cai, W., Valentim, C. S. C., Liang, H., Baxter, S. L., ... & Zhang, K. (2018). Identifying medical diagnoses and treatable diseases by image-based deep learning. *Cell*, 172(5), 1122-1131.e9. doi:10.1016/j.cell.2018.02.010.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I have successfully extracted the following datasets from the paper:

1. **Butterflies vs. Moths Dataset**
   - Citation: Singla, A., Bogunovic, I., Bartók, G., Karbasi, A., & Krause, A. (2014). Near-optimally teaching the crowd to classify. In International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), pp. 154–162.

2. **Chest X-ray Dataset**
   - Citation: Kermany, D. S., Goldbaum, M., Cai, W., Valentim, C. S. C., Liang, H., Baxter, S. L., ... & Zhang, K. (2018). Identifying medical diagnoses and treatable diseases by image-based deep learning. *Cell*, 172(5), 1122-1131.e9. doi:10.1016/j.cell.2018.02.010.

With this information, I am ready to format the dataset entries as needed for further processing or analysis.
