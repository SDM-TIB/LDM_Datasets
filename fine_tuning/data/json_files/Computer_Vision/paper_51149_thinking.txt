To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Zero-Shot Text-Guided Object Generation with Dream Fields" by Ajay Jain et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to gather initial insights about any datasets referenced. The abstract mentions the use of "large datasets of captioned images from the web," which suggests that there may be specific datasets that are crucial to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention the use of the **Common Objects in Context (COCO)** dataset, specifically a subset of it that includes object-centric captions. This is a significant dataset for their experiments, and I need to note its details.

In the **supplementary material**, the authors provide additional context about the **Object Centric COCO dataset**, which consists of 153 test set prompts and 74 development set prompts. This dataset is derived from the larger COCO dataset and is specifically filtered for object-centric examples.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Common Objects in Context (COCO)**:
   - The citation for the COCO dataset is:
     > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Doll√°r, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

2. **Object Centric COCO**:
   - Since this is a subset of the COCO dataset, it does not have a separate citation. Instead, I will reference it as derived from the COCO dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
