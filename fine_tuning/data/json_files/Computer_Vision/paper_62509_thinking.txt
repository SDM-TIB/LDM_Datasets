To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Delays in Spiking Neural Networks Using Dilated Convolutions with Learnable Spacings" by Ilyass Hammouamri et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluated their method on three datasets: **Spiking Heidelberg Dataset (SHD)**, **Spiking Speech Commands (SSC)**, and **Google Speech Commands v0.02 (GSC)**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will look into the **introduction** and **methods sections** to gather more details about these datasets. The introduction provides context about the datasets, mentioning that SHD consists of recordings of spoken digits, while SSC and GSC are larger datasets for speech command recognition.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the datasets in detail. They mention that:
1. **Spiking Heidelberg Dataset (SHD)**: This dataset consists of 10,000 recordings of spoken digits (0-9) in both English and German.
2. **Spiking Speech Commands (SSC)**: This dataset contains 100,000 recordings across 35 different classes, designed for speech command recognition.
3. **Google Speech Commands v0.02 (GSC)**: This is a non-spiking version of the SSC dataset, also containing 100,000 recordings.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Spiking Heidelberg Dataset (SHD)**, the citation is:
  > Benjamin Cramer, Yannik Stradmann, Johannes Schemmel, and Friedemann Zenke. *The Heidelberg Spiking Data Sets for the Systematic Evaluation of Spiking Neural Networks*. IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 33(7):2744–2757, 2022. doi: 10.1109/TNNLS.2020.3044364.

- For **Spiking Speech Commands (SSC)** and **Google Speech Commands v0.02 (GSC)**, the citation is:
  > Pete Warden. *Speech Commands: A Dataset for Limited-Vocabulary Speech Recognition*. arXiv, 2018.

Now, I will summarize the datasets with their respective citations:

1. **Spiking Heidelberg Dataset (SHD)**: A dataset of 10,000 recordings of spoken digits (0-9) in English and German.
   - Citation: Benjamin Cramer, Yannik Stradmann, Johannes Schemmel, and Friedemann Zenke. *The Heidelberg Spiking Data Sets for the Systematic Evaluation of Spiking Neural Networks*. IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 33(7):2744–2757, 2022. doi: 10.1109/TNNLS.2020.3044364.

2. **Spiking Speech Commands (SSC)**: A dataset containing 100,000 recordings across 35 different classes for speech command recognition.
   - Citation: Pete Warden. *Speech Commands: A Dataset for Limited-Vocabulary Speech Recognition*. arXiv, 2018.

3. **Google Speech Commands v0.02 (GSC)**: A non-spiking version of the SSC dataset, also with 100,000 recordings.
   - Citation: Pete Warden. *Speech Commands: A Dataset for Limited-Vocabulary Speech Recognition*. arXiv, 2018.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
