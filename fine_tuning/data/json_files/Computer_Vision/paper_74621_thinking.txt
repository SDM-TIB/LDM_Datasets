To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SSAD: Self-supervised Auxiliary Detection Framework for Panoramic X-ray based Dental Disease Diagnosis" by Zijian Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **DENTEX dataset** for evaluating the proposed SSAD framework, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** where the authors provide details about the dataset used. In the section titled **III. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS**, the authors state that they used the **DENTEX dataset** for their experiments. They describe it as a public dataset consisting of panoramic X-rays collected from patients above 12 years of age, which includes three detection tasks: quadrant detection, tooth enumeration, and disease diagnosis.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DENTEX dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- For **DENTEX dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hamamci, I.E., Er, S., Simsar, E., Sekuboyina, A., Gundogar, M., Stadlinger, B., Mehl, A., Menze, B. (2023). *Diffusion-based hierarchical multi-label object detection to analyze panoramic dental x-rays*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.06500.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **DENTEX Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the SSAD framework and consists of panoramic X-rays collected from patients above 12 years of age. It includes three detection tasks: quadrant detection, tooth enumeration, and disease diagnosis.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
