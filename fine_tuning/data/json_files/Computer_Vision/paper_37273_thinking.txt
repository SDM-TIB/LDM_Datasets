To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multichannel Variable-Size Convolution for Sentence Classification" by Wenpeng Yin and Hinrich Schütze, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed MVCNN architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on four tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. In **subsection 5.2 (Datasets and Experimental Setup)**, the authors explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Standard Sentiment Treebank**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis of movie reviews, with a binary classification task and a fine-grained classification task. The authors provide specific splits for training, development, and testing.

2. **Sentiment140**: This is a large-scale dataset of tweets labeled for sentiment classification based on emoticons. The authors mention the size of the training and test sets.

3. **Subjectivity Classification Dataset**: This dataset consists of subjective and objective sentences, and the authors report results based on 10-fold cross-validation.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Standard Sentiment Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Y Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D Manning, Andrew Y Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of the conference on empirical methods in natural language processing, volume 1631, page 1642. Citeseer, 2013.

- For **Sentiment140**, the citation is:
  > Alec Go, Richa Bhayani, and Lei Huang. *Twitter sentiment classification using distant supervision*. CS224N Project Report, Stanford, pages 1–12, 2009.

- For the **Subjectivity Classification Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bo Pang and Lillian Lee. *A sentimental education: Sentiment analysis using subjectivity summarization based on minimum cuts*. In Proceedings of the 42nd annual meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics, page 271. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2004.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
