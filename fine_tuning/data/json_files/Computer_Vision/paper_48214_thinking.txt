To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sampling-Frequency-Independent Audio Source Separation Using Convolution Layer Based on Impulse Invariant Method" by Koichi Saito et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the goal of the research, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various applications of audio source separation but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **experimental evaluation section** where datasets are likely to be mentioned.

In **section IV (Experimental Evaluation)**, the authors mention using the **MUSDB18-HQ dataset** for their experiments. This dataset is described as consisting of 86 training, 14 validation, and 50 test tracks, which contain separate recordings of four musical instruments (vocals, bass, drums, and other). This is a clear indication that I have found a dataset relevant to their research.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MUSDB18-HQ dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> Z. Raﬁi, A. Liutkus, F.-R. St¨oter, S. I. Mimilakis, and R. Bittner. *MUSDB18-HQ - an uncompressed version of MUSDB18*, 2019.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **MUSDB18-HQ Dataset**: This dataset is used for music source separation experiments and contains separate recordings of four musical instruments. It consists of 86 training, 14 validation, and 50 test tracks.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset.
