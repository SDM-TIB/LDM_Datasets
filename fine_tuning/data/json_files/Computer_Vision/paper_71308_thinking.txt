To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequential Recommendation with Latent Relations based on Large Language Model" by Shenghao Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on multiple public datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4.1), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention three datasets:

1. **MovieLens**: This dataset is widely used for movie recommendations and consists of user ratings and attribute information for movies. The authors specify that they utilized the MovieLens-100k version for their experiments.

2. **Amazon Office Products**: This dataset is a subset of the Amazon e-commerce dataset, representing the office products domain. It contains user ratings, reviews, and rich item metadata.

3. **Amazon Electronics**: Similar to the Office Products dataset, this is another subset from the Amazon e-commerce dataset, but it focuses on the electronics domain.

In the same section, the authors provide details about the datasets, including the number of users, items, interactions, and the density of the datasets. This information is crucial for understanding the context of the datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are typically provided in the references, and I will ensure to include them in the dataset descriptions.

For the **MovieLens dataset**, the citation is:
> GroupLens Research. *MovieLens Datasets*. https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

For the **Amazon Office Products dataset**, the citation is:
> Julian McAuley and J. Leskovec. *From Amateurs to Connoisseurs: Modeling the Evolution of User Expertise through Online Reviews*. In Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), 2013. https://doi.org/10.1145/2462216.2462218

For the **Amazon Electronics dataset**, the citation is:
> Julian McAuley and J. Leskovec. *Hidden Factors and Hidden Topics: Understanding Rating Dimensions with Review Text*. In Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys), 2013. https://doi.org/10.1145/2507157.2507161

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that they are ready for review or further processing.
