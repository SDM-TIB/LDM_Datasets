To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Non-native Word-level Pronunciation Scoring with Phone-level Mixup Data Augmentation and Multi-source Information" by Kaiqi Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the experiments were conducted on the **Speechocean762** dataset, which is a significant clue that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Experimental setup)**, where the authors describe the data used for their experiments. They mention that the pronunciation scoring data consists of **5,000 English utterances spoken by 250 non-native learners from the Speechocean762 dataset**. This confirms the use of this dataset for their experiments.

Additionally, the authors reference another dataset, **L2-ARCTIC**, stating it has collected **11,026 utterances**. This dataset is also relevant to their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **Speechocean762**, the citation is:
   > J. Zhang, Z. Zhang, Y. Wang, Z. Yan, Q. Song, Y. Huang, K. Li, D. Povey, and Y. Wang. *speechocean762: An open-source non-native English speech corpus for pronunciation assessment*. In Proc. Interspeech, 2021.

2. For **L2-ARCTIC**, the citation is:
   > G. Zhao, S. Sonsaat, A. Silpachai, I. Lucic, E. Chukharev-Hudilainen, J. Levis, and R. Gutierrez-Osuna. *L2-arctic: A non-native English speech corpus*. In Proc. Interspeech, 2018, pp. 2783â€“2787.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **Speechocean762**: A dataset consisting of 5,000 English utterances spoken by non-native learners, used for pronunciation scoring.
- **L2-ARCTIC**: A dataset containing 11,026 utterances, also relevant for pronunciation assessment.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
