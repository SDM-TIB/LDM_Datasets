To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NeRF On-the-go: Exploiting Uncertainty for Distractor-free NeRFs in the Wild" by Weining Ren et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention the introduction of a method that enables robust synthesis of novel views in complex scenes, which suggests that they likely used specific datasets for their experiments. The introduction may provide further context about the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe the **On-the-go Dataset**, which is explicitly mentioned as a dataset they captured for their experiments. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including the number of sequences, types of scenes, and the devices used for capturing the data.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a detailed description of the **On-the-go Dataset**. They mention that it contains 12 casually captured sequences, including 10 outdoor and 2 indoor scenes, with varying ratios of distractors. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

I will also check the **supplementary material** for any additional datasets mentioned. The authors reference the **RobustNeRF Dataset**, which is used for comparison in their experiments. I will extract the relevant details about this dataset as well.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The citations are typically found in the **References section** of the paper. For the datasets mentioned:

1. **On-the-go Dataset**: Since this dataset is self-captured by the authors, I will note that it does not have a formal citation but will describe it in detail based on the information provided in the paper.

2. **RobustNeRF Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Sara Sabour, Suhani Vora, Daniel Duckworth, Ivan Krasin, David J Fleet, and Andrea Tagliasacchi. *RobustNeRF: Ignoring Distractors with Robust Losses*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for any datasets that have them, while also providing a detailed description of the self-captured dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured and cited.
