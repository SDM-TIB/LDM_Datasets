To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Consistent3D: Towards Consistent High-Fidelity Text-to-3D Generation with Deterministic Sampling Prior" by Zike Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a high-level overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for training or evaluation. In this case, the abstract discusses the development of a method for text-to-3D generation but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their approach and may reference specific datasets they utilized for training or evaluation. I will pay close attention to any figures or tables that might summarize the datasets.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention using various prompts for generating 3D models, but they do not specify any particular datasets that were used for training their models. Instead, they refer to the use of pre-trained diffusion models without 3D priors, which suggests that they may not have relied on traditional datasets but rather on existing models.

To ensure I have not missed any datasets, I will also check the **references section** for any cited works that may include datasets. However, the references primarily consist of papers discussing methodologies and models rather than specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. The paper does not utilize specific datasets for training but relies on pre-trained diffusion models.
2. The prompts listed in Table 2 serve as input for the text-to-3D generation process but do not constitute a dataset in the traditional sense.

Given this analysis, I will note that there are no formal datasets to cite from this paper, but I will include the reference for the paper itself as it provides context for the research conducted.

In conclusion, I will document that while the paper discusses the generation of 3D models from text prompts, it does not reference any specific datasets, and the focus is on leveraging existing pre-trained models for the task.
