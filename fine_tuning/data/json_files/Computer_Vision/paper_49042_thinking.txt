To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discrete-time Temporal Network Embedding via Implicit Hierarchical Learning in Hyperbolic Space" by Menglin Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract highlights that experimental results are demonstrated on multiple real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in the **experiments section** (Section 5.1.1). I will carefully note the names of these datasets and any relevant statistics or characteristics provided.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **DISEASE**: A synthetic dataset based on the SIR disease spreading model.
2. **HepPh**: An academic co-author network related to high energy physics phenomenology.
3. **FB**: A social network graph of Facebook Wall posts.
4. **AS733**: An Internet router network dataset.
5. **Enron**: An email communication network.
6. **COLAB**: An academic cooperation network.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **references section** of the paper or from the context provided in the text. 

- For **DISEASE**, the citation is:
  > Ottar N Bjørnstad, Bärbel F Finkenstädt, and Bryan T Grenfell. *Dynamics of measles epidemics: estimating scaling of transmission rates using a time series SIR model*. Ecological Monographs, 72(2):169–184, 2002.

- For **HepPh**, the citation is:
  > The HepPh dataset is derived from the e-print arXiv website, which is a well-known repository for academic papers in high energy physics.

- For **FB**, the citation is:
  > The Facebook Wall posts dataset is available at the Network Repository: http://networkrepository.com/ia-facebook-wall-wosn-dir.php.

- For **AS733**, the citation is:
  > The AS733 dataset is collected from the University of Oregon Route Views Project, available at: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/as-733.html.

- For **Enron**, the citation is:
  > The Enron email dataset is available at: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~arb/data/email-Enron/.

- For **COLAB**, the citation is:
  > The COLAB dataset is available at: https://github.com/VGraphRNN/VGRNN/tree/master/data.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately represent the datasets used in the research paper.
