To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ConceptExpress: Harnessing Diffusion Models for Single-image Unsupervised Concept Extraction" by Shaozhe Hao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation or training. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the problem they are addressing and may reference datasets that are relevant to their work. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to existing datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Dataset and Baseline)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention that they collected a set D1 of 961 images from Unsplash, ensuring that each image contains at least two distinct instance-level concepts. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

The authors also mention a second dataset, D2, which consists of 7 images provided by another work (Break-A-Scene). This indicates that they are using a combination of their own collected dataset and an existing dataset for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Unsplash Dataset**: The authors do not provide a specific citation for the Unsplash dataset in the text, but it is a well-known source of high-quality images. The citation can be referenced as:
   > Unsplash. *A collection of free high-resolution photos*. Available at: https://unsplash.com/

2. **Break-A-Scene Dataset**: The citation for the dataset used from the Break-A-Scene paper is:
   > Avrahami, O., Aberman, K., Fried, O., Cohen-Or, D., Lischinski, D. *Break-a-scene: Extracting multiple concepts from a single image*. In: SIGGRAPH Asia (2023).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
