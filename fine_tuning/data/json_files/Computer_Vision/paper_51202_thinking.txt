To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Embedding Arithmetic of Multimodal Queries for Image Retrieval" by Guillaume Couairon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the **SIMAT dataset**, which is explicitly stated to contain 6,000 images and 18,000 textual transformation queries. This is a clear indication that I need to gather more details about this dataset.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (The SIMAT database)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the SIMAT dataset. They mention that it consists of 5,989 images annotated with subject-relation-object triplets and 17,996 transformation queries. This section also outlines the construction process and the requirements for the dataset, confirming its significance for the research.

In addition to the SIMAT dataset, I will check for any other datasets referenced in the paper. The authors mention several existing datasets in the **related work section**. Notably, they refer to:

1. **Visual Genome**: This dataset is used to create the SIMAT dataset and is crucial for understanding the transformations. The authors state that they used annotations from Visual Genome to ensure the transformation queries are feasible.

2. **COCO dataset**: Mentioned in the context of fine-tuning multimodal embeddings, this dataset is significant for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **Visual Genome dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ranjay Krishna, Yuke Zhu, Oliver Groth, Justin Johnson, Kenji Hata, Joshua Kravitz, Stephanie Chen, Yannis Kalantidis, Li-Jia Li, David A Shamma, et al. *Visual Genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 123(1):32–73, 2017.

- For the **COCO dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755. Springer, 2014.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the SIMAT dataset and the references to Visual Genome and COCO, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
