To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dual reparametrized Variational Generative Model for Time-Series Forecasting" by Ziang Chen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed model is evaluated on multiple datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the author discusses the application of the model in various domains. Here, I will look for specific mentions of datasets used for experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets used. The paper mentions two datasets: **ETDataset (Electricity Transformer Dataset)** and **Covid-19 dataset**. I will note down the context in which these datasets are used, including any specific details about their structure or purpose.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **ETDataset**, the citation is:
> Haoyi Zhou et al. "Informer: Beyond Efficient Transformer for Long Sequence Time-Series Forecasting." 2021. arXiv: 2012.07436 [cs.LG].

For the **Covid-19 dataset**, the citation is:
> O. Wahltinez et al. "COVID-19 Open-Data: curating a fine-grained, global-scale data repository for SARS-CoV-2." 2020. Work in progress. URL: https://goo.gle/covid-19-open-data.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the details, including the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for further processing or review.
