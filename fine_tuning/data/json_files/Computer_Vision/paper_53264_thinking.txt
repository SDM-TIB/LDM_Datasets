To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Video Frame Interpolation Based on Deformable Kernel Region" by Haoyue Tian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on four datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments in the **Experimental details** section. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **Vimeo90K**: This dataset consists of 3758 video sequences, each containing three frames, with a resolution of 448 × 256. The authors reference the dataset as follows:
   > Xue, T., Chen, B., Wu, J., Wei, D., & Freeman, W. T. (2019). Video enhancement with task-oriented flow. *International Journal of Computer Vision*, 127(8), 1106–1125.

2. **UCF101**: This dataset is a large-scale human behavior dataset containing video sequences with camera motion and cluttered backgrounds. The authors selected 333 triples from it for testing, with a resolution of 320 × 240. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Soomro, K., Zamir, A. R., & Shah, M. (2012). UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402*.

3. **DAVIS480p**: This dataset is composed of 50 high-quality, full HD video sequences that cover various video object segmentation challenges. The authors selected 50 groups of three consecutive frames for testing, with each frame having a resolution of 854 × 480. The citation is:
   > Perazzi, F., Pont-Tuset, J., McWilliams, B., Van Gool, L., Gross, M., & Sorkine-Hornung, A. (2016). A benchmark dataset and evaluation methodology for video object segmentation. In *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition* (pp. 724–732).

4. **MPI-Sintel**: This dataset introduces a new optical flow dataset derived from an open-source 3D animation short film. The authors constructed triples from seven sequences for testing. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Butler, D. J., Wulff, J., Stanley, G. B., & Black, M. J. (2012). A naturalistic open source movie for optical flow evaluation. In *European Conference on Computer Vision* (pp. 611–625). Springer.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I accurately compile this information into a structured format for further use.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for any downstream processing or review.
