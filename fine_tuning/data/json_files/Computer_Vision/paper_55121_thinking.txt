To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SSP-Pose: Symmetry-Aware Shape Prior Deformation for Direct Category-Level Object Pose Estimation" by Ruida Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any subsection that discusses datasets. In this paper, the authors mention using **NOCS-REAL275** and **NOCS-CAMERA25** datasets for evaluation. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and the number of images they contain.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the NOCS-REAL275 dataset as containing 4.3k images captured from 7 scenes for training and 2.75k images from 6 scenes for testing, covering objects of 6 known categories (bottle, bowl, camera, can, laptop, and mug). The NOCS-CAMERA25 dataset is described as a synthetic dataset generated by rendering virtual objects on real backgrounds, providing 275k images for training and 25k for testing, sharing the same categories as NOCS-REAL275.

After gathering this information, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **NOCS-REAL275**, the citation is:
  > Wang, H., Sridhar, S., Huang, J., Valentin, J., Song, S., & Guibas, L. J. (2019). Normalized object coordinate space for category-level 6D object pose and size estimation. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2642–2651.

- For **NOCS-CAMERA25**, the citation is:
  > Wang, H., Sridhar, S., Huang, J., Valentin, J., Song, S., & Guibas, L. J. (2019). Normalized object coordinate space for category-level 6D object pose and size estimation. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2642–2651.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
