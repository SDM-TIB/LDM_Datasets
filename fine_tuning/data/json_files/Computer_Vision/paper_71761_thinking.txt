To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hash3D: Training-free Acceleration for 3D Generation" by Xingyi Yang and Xinchao Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments covering 5 text-to-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, which suggests that datasets were used in these experiments. However, specific dataset names are not provided here, so I will need to look further.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 5) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors mention using the **Google Scanned Objects (GSO) dataset** for evaluating image-to-3D performance. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized, and I will need to gather more details about it.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the GSO dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Downs, L., Francis, A., Koenig, N., Kinman, B., Hickman, R., Reymann, K., McHugh, T.B., Vanhoucke, V. "Google scanned objects: A high-quality dataset of 3D scanned household items." In: 2022 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA). pp. 2553â€“2560. IEEE (2022).

Since the paper primarily focuses on the Hash3D method and does not mention additional datasets explicitly, I will conclude my extraction here. 

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name and its full citation as required.
