To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convex Sparse Blind Deconvolution" by Qingyun Sun and David Donoho, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract typically provides a concise overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations. 

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. This section often discusses the context of the research and may reference prior works that utilized specific datasets.

I will then examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is where the authors usually describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will look for sections that explicitly mention the datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used the **MNIST dataset**, I would look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

If the authors used a dataset that is less well-known or specific to their research, I will ensure to document its citation accurately, following the format used in the references.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured and can be easily accessed by others interested in the datasets used in this research.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper while maintaining the integrity of the citations.
