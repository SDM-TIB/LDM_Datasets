To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Subspace Clustering Networks" by Pan Ji et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of subspace clustering and mention the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for specific names of datasets mentioned in this section.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors detail their evaluations. Here, they explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Extended Yale B Dataset**: This dataset consists of 38 subjects, each represented by 64 face images taken under varying illumination conditions. The authors note that they down-sampled the images for computational feasibility.

2. **ORL Dataset**: This dataset contains 400 human face images from 40 subjects, with each subject having 10 samples taken under different lighting conditions and facial expressions.

3. **COIL20 Dataset**: This dataset includes 1440 gray-scale images distributed over 20 objects, with images taken at different angles.

4. **COIL100 Dataset**: Similar to COIL20, this dataset consists of 7200 images across 100 objects, with images taken at various poses.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Extended Yale B Dataset**, the citation is:
  > K.-C. Lee, J. Ho, and D. J. Kriegman. *Acquiring linear subspaces for face recognition under variable lighting*. TPAMI, 27(5):684–698, 2005.

- For the **ORL Dataset**, the citation is:
  > F. S. Samaria and A. C. Harter. *Parameterisation of a stochastic model for human face identification*. In Applications of Computer Vision, 1994., Proceedings of the Second IEEE Workshop on, pages 138–142. IEEE, 1994.

- For the **COIL20 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. A. Nene, S. K. Nayar, and H. Murase. *Columbia object image library (COIL-20)*. Technical Report CUCS-005-96, 1996.

- For the **COIL100 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. A. Nene, S. K. Nayar, and H. Murase. *Columbia object image library (COIL-100)*. Technical Report CUCS-006-96, 1996.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
