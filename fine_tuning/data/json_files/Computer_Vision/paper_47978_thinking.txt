To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Free-form tumor synthesis in computed tomography images via richer generative adversarial network" by Qiangguo Jin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors perform evaluations on public CT image datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Dataset)**, as this section is likely to contain the most relevant information regarding the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors mention three specific datasets:

1. **Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge (LiTS)**: This dataset includes 130 CT scans with ground truth for training and 70 scans without ground truth for testing. It is noted that 116 of the training scans contain tumors.

2. **Kidney Tumor Segmentation Challenge (KiTS)**: This dataset consists of 300 CT scans, with 210 scans containing manual kidney tumor segmentations.

3. **Lung Nodule Analysis 2016 (LUNA)**: This dataset contains annotated data for 888 patients, including CT images and XML files with nodule locations.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge (LiTS)**, the citation is:
  > Bilic, P., Christ, P. F., Vorontsov, E., Chlebus, G., Chen, H., Dou, Q., Fu, C.-W., Han, X., Heng, P.-A., Hesser, J., et al. (2019). The Liver Tumor Segmentation Benchmark (LiTS). arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.04056.

- For the **Kidney Tumor Segmentation Challenge (KiTS)**, the citation is:
  > Heller, N., Sathianathen, N. J., Kalapara, A. R., Walczak, E., Moore, K., Kaluzniak, H., Rosenberg, J., Blake, P., Rengel, Z., Oestreich, M., et al. (2019). The KiTS19 Challenge Data: 300 Kidney Tumor Cases with Clinical Context, CT Semantic Segmentations, and Surgical Outcomes. arXiv preprint arXiv:1904.00445.

- For the **Lung Nodule Analysis 2016 (LUNA)** dataset, the citation is:
  > Setio, A. A. A., Traverso, A., De Bel, T., Berens, M. S. N., Den Bogaard, C. V., Cerello, P., Chen, H., Dou, Q., Fantacci, M. E., Geurts, H., et al. (2017). Validation, comparison, and combination of algorithms for automatic detection of pulmonary nodules in computed tomography images: The LUNA16 Challenge. Medical Image Analysis, 42, 1-13.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
