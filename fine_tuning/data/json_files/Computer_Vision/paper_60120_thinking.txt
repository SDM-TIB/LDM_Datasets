To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UATTA-EB: Uncertainty-Aware Test-Time Augmented Ensemble of BERTs for Classifying Common Mental Illnesses on Social Media Posts" by Pratinav Seth and Mihir Agarwal, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of analyzing social media data for mental health classification, which suggests that they are likely using specific datasets from social media platforms.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they describe a dataset extracted from Reddit, which consists of 16,703 social media posts. The dataset is categorized into six mental illnesses: Bipolar, ADHD, Anxiety, Depression, PTSD, and None. It is also noted that the dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.

Now, I will gather the details for the dataset:

1. **Reddit Mental Illness Dataset**: This dataset contains 16,703 posts from Reddit, including titles and content, and is used to classify posts into one of six mental illnesses. The dataset is divided into three parts: 13,727 for training, 1,488 for validation, and 1,488 for testing.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the Reddit dataset, as it is a commonly used dataset in mental health research. Therefore, I will reference the original source of the dataset if available or note that it is derived from Reddit.

Since the authors do not provide a formal citation for the dataset, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Reddit Mental Illness Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset containing 16,703 social media posts from Reddit, classified into six mental illnesses. The dataset is split into training (13,727), validation (1,488), and test (1,488) sets.
- **Citation**: No formal citation provided; derived from Reddit.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I have accurately captured the dataset details and any relevant citations.
