To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Markov Network for Traffic Forecasting with Missing Data" by Zhiyong Cui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three real-world traffic state datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 5.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **PEMS-BAY**: This dataset is collected by California Transportation Agencies (CalTrans) and contains speed information from 325 sensors in the Bay Area, covering a six-month period from January 1st, 2017, to June 30th, 2017. The dataset has a time step interval of 5 minutes, totaling 16,941,600 observed traffic data points. The adjacency matrix is defined according to a referenced source.

2. **METR-LA**: This dataset is collected from loop detectors on the freeway of Los Angeles County, containing speed information from 207 sensors over a four-month period from March 1st, 2012, to June 30th, 2012. It also has a 5-minute time step interval, with a total of 6,519,002 observed traffic data points. The adjacency matrix is similarly defined according to a referenced source.

3. **INRIX-SEA**: This dataset is collected by the INRIX company from various sources, including GPS probes and road sensors, covering the Seattle downtown area with 725 road segments. It spans a one-year period from January 1st, 2012, to December 31st, 2012, with a 5-minute time step interval and a total of 76,212,000 observed traffic data points. Due to privacy policies, this dataset is not published.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

- For **PEMS-BAY**:
  > California Transportation Agencies (CalTrans). *Performance Measurement System (PeMS)*. Available at: https://github.com/liyaguang/DCRNN.

- For **METR-LA**:
  > California Transportation Agencies (CalTrans). *Performance Measurement System (PeMS)*. Available at: https://github.com/liyaguang/DCRNN.

- For **INRIX-SEA**:
  > Washington Department of Transportation. *INRIX Traffic Data*. (Not publicly available due to privacy policies).

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
