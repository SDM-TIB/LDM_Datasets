To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Trajectory Alignment: Understanding the Edge of Stability Phenomenon via Bifurcation Theory" by Minhak Song and Chulhee Yun, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their analyses. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any references to datasets used in the empirical studies. If the authors mention using a specific dataset, I will note its name and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like "CIFAR-10," I will look for the original citation for CIFAR-10 in the references. The citation typically includes the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear and organized manner, making sure to highlight the datasets used in the study along with their respective citations.
