To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Network Architectures for Location Estimation in the Internet of Things" by Ullah Ihsan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of neural networks for location estimation but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Numerical Results)**, where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention using both **simulated data** and **real-world data** for their analysis. I will need to gather more details about these datasets.

In the subsection **IV.A (Analysis Using Simulated Data)**, the authors describe a simulated dataset created for their experiments. They mention that the focus area is 200m x 200m with 5 RSUs (Road Side Units) located at specific coordinates. However, they do not provide a formal citation for this simulated dataset, as it is generated for the purpose of the study.

In **subsection IV.B (Analysis Using Real-world Data)**, the authors describe the real-world dataset collected from vehicles in a 150m x 150m area by 3 RSUs. They mention that the RSS measurements were taken from random vehicles equipped with GPS units. Again, there is no formal citation provided for this dataset, as it is based on their own data collection efforts.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for either the simulated or real-world datasets, I will note that these datasets are derived from the authors' own experiments and do not have external citations.

Now, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets:

1. **Simulated Dataset**: A dataset created for the purpose of the study, focusing on a 200m x 200m area with 5 RSUs. No formal citation is provided.

2. **Real-world Dataset**: Collected from vehicles in a 150m x 150m area by 3 RSUs, with RSS measurements and GPS locations. No formal citation is provided.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the datasets, even though they lack formal citations. This will ensure that the information is clear and accessible for future reference or analysis.
