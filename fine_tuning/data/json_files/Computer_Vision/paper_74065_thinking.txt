To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SAM-PM: Enhancing Video Camouflaged Object Detection using Spatio-Temporal Attention" by Muhammad Nawfal Meeran et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a new method for video camouflage object detection, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **COD10K**: This dataset is described as the largest camouflage object detection dataset, consisting of 5066 camouflaged images (3040 for training, 2026 for testing), along with 1934 non-camouflaged images and 3000 background images divided into 10 superclasses and 78 subclasses.

2. **CAD (Camouflaged Animal Dataset)**: This dataset consists of 9 video sequences extracted from YouTube videos, with hand-labeled ground-truth masks on every 5th frame.

3. **MoCA-Mask**: This dataset includes 87 video sequences (71 for training and 16 for testing) that extend the bounding box annotations from the original Moving Camouflaged Animal (MoCA) dataset to dense segmentation masks.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **COD10K**, the citation is:
  > Deng-Ping Fan, Ge-Peng Ji, Ming-Ming Cheng, and Ling Shao. *Concealed object detection*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2022.

- For **CAD**, the citation is:
  > Bideau, P., & Learned-Miller, E. *It’s moving! A probabilistic model for causal motion segmentation in moving camera videos*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2016: 14th European Conference, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, October 11-14, 2016, Proceedings, Part VIII 14, pages 433–449. Springer, 2016.

- For **MoCA-Mask**, the citation is:
  > Hala Lamdouar, Charig Yang, Weidi Xie, and Andrew Zisserman. *Betrayed by motion: Camouflaged object discovery via motion segmentation*. In Proceedings of the Asian Conference on Computer Vision, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for clarity and proper attribution.
