To extract datasets from the research paper titled "JeDi: Joint-Image Diffusion Models for Finetuning-Free Personalized Text-to-Image Generation" by Yu Zeng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a new method for personalized text-to-image generation and mentions the creation of a synthetic dataset, which suggests that datasets are a key component of their work.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly **section 3 (Method)**, where the authors describe their dataset creation process. Here, they introduce the **Synthetic Same-Subject (S3) dataset**, which is constructed using large language models and single-image diffusion models. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, as it contains sets of images sharing a common subject.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors mention that they also include video frames from **WebVid10M** and rendered multi-view images from **Objaverse** during training. This indicates that these datasets are also part of their evaluation process.

I will now gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **Synthetic Same-Subject (S3) Dataset**: The authors created this dataset specifically for their research, so it does not have a traditional citation. However, I will note that it is described in detail in the paper itself.

2. **WebVid10M**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Max Bain, Arsha Nagrani, GÃ¼l Varol, and Andrew Zisserman. *Frozen in time: A joint video and image encoder for end-to-end retrieval*. In International Conference on Computer Vision, 2021.

3. **Objaverse**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Matt Deitke, Dustin Schwenk, Jordi Salvador, Luca Weihs, Oscar Michel, Eli VanderBilt, Ludwig Schmidt, Kiana Ehsani, Aniruddha Kembhavi, and Ali Farhadi. *Objaverse: A universe of annotated 3D objects*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2023.

4. **LAION Aesthetic Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Christoph Schuhmann, Richard Vencu, Romain Beaumont, Robert Kaczmarczyk, Clayton Mullis, Aarush Katta, Theo Coombes, Jenia Jitsev, and Aran Komatsuzaki. *Laion-400m: Open dataset of clip-filtered 400 million image-text pairs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.02114, 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant datasets are documented accurately, along with their respective citations.
