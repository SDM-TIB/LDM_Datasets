To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CAMixerSR: Only Details Need More 'Attention'" by Yan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conduct experiments on various super-resolution tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention using the **DIV2K dataset** for training and the **ODI-SR dataset** for omnidirectional image super-resolution tasks. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

1. For the **DIV2K dataset**, the citation is:
   > Eirikur Agustsson and Radu Timofte. *NTIRE 2017 challenge on single image super-resolution: Dataset and study*. In CVPRW, pages 1122–1131, 2017.

2. For the **ODI-SR dataset**, the citation is:
   > Xin Deng, Hao Wang, Mai Xu, Yichen Guo, Yuhang Song, and Li Yang. *Lau-net: Latitude adaptive upscaling network for omnidirectional image super-resolution*. In CVPR, pages 9189–9198, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
