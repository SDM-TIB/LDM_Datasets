To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UNet-2022: Exploring Dynamics in Non-isomorphic Architecture" by Jiansen Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on various medical image segmentation tasks, which suggests that datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly the **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. This section is likely to provide detailed descriptions of each dataset, including the number of samples, types of annotations, and how the data was split for training and testing.

In subsection 4.1, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Synapse Dataset**: This dataset consists of 30 abdominal CT scans with annotations for 13 organs. The authors mention that they extracted 3,779 slices from these scans and split the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. **ACDC Dataset**: The ACDC dataset includes 100 samples for cardiac segmentation, with specific annotations for the right ventricle, left ventricle, and myocardium. The authors provide details on how the dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets.

3. **EM Dataset**: This dataset contains 30 images from electron microscopy, with a specified size of 512 × 512 pixels. The authors describe how the dataset was divided into training, validation, and testing samples.

4. **ISIC-2016 and PH2 Datasets**: The ISIC-2016 dataset includes 900 samples for skin lesion segmentation, while the PH2 dataset is used for testing. The authors mention the evaluation metrics used for these datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I find are:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
