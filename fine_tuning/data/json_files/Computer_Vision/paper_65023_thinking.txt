To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative Modeling of Regular and Irregular Time Series Data via Koopman VAEs" by Ilan Naiman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their characteristics and how they were used in the experiments.

Upon reviewing Section 5, I find that the authors mention four datasets:

1. **Sines Dataset**: A multivariate simulated dataset characterized by its continuity and periodic properties. Each sample is generated using a sine function with random parameters.

2. **Stocks Dataset**: This dataset consists of daily historical Google stock prices from 2004 to 2019, including multiple channels such as high, low, opening, closing, and adjusted closing prices.

3. **Energy Dataset**: A multivariate dataset from the UCI appliance energy prediction repository, which includes 28 channels and is characterized by noisy periodicity and continuous-valued measurements.

4. **MuJoCo Dataset**: A dataset generated using the MuJoCo physics engine, which simulates time series data with 14 channels.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Sines Dataset**, since it is a simulated dataset created by the authors, it may not have a formal citation but can be described as follows:
  > Naiman, I., Erichson, N. B., Ren, P., Mahoney, M. W., & Azencot, O. (2024). Generative Modeling of Regular and Irregular Time Series Data via Koopman VAEs. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

- For the **Stocks Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Candanedo, L. (2017). Appliances energy prediction. UCI Machine Learning Repository.

- For the **Energy Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Candanedo, L. (2017). Appliances energy prediction. UCI Machine Learning Repository.

- For the **MuJoCo Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), pp. 5026â€“5033.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation for proper attribution.
