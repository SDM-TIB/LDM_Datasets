To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LAMA-Net: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation via Latent Alignment and Manifold Learning for RUL Prediction" by Manu Joseph and Varchita Lalwani, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their method using the **C-MAPSS Turbofan Engine dataset by NASA**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. The authors describe the **C-MAPSS dataset** in detail, noting that it consists of run-to-failure data for turbofan engines, simulated using a thermodynamic model. They mention that the dataset contains information from 21 sensors and is divided into four subsets: **FD001, FD002, FD003, and FD004**. Each subset has different operational conditions and fault modes, which is important for understanding the dataset's structure.

In the **appendix**, the authors provide additional details about the C-MAPSS dataset, including its properties, the number of training and testing trajectories, and the specific characteristics of each subset. This information is essential for accurately describing the dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the dataset mentioned in the paper. The citation for the C-MAPSS dataset is as follows:

- **C-MAPSS Dataset**:
  > Saxena, A., Goebel, K., Simon, D., & Eklund, N. H. W. (2008). Damage propagation modeling for aircraft engine run-to-failure simulation. In *2008 International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management*, 1â€“9.

After compiling this information, I will summarize the dataset details, including its purpose, structure, and any relevant characteristics, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
