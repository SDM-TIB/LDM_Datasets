To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Positive Label Is All You Need for Multi-Label Classification" by Zhixiang Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors reference their method's effectiveness on **MS-COCO** and **PASCAL VOC** datasets, indicating that these are key datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors discuss their methodology and results. Here, they explicitly mention using the **MS-COCO** dataset and the **PASCAL VOC 2007** dataset for their experiments. I will take note of any specific details provided about these datasets, such as their characteristics or the context in which they were used.

After confirming the datasets in the experiments section, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources.

The citations I will extract are:

1. For **MS-COCO**:
   > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (pp. 740–755).

2. For **PASCAL VOC 2007**:
   > Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C. K. I., Winn, J., & Zisserman, A. (2010). *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2), 303–338.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
