To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discovering Hidden Physics Behind Transport Dynamics" by Peirong Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors used a public brain magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion dataset of stroke patients, which suggests that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used in the experiments. In **section 5.3 (ISLES2017: Brain Perfusion Dataset)**, the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention the **ISLES 2017 dataset**, which includes 75 ischemic stroke patients, and provide details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ISLES 2017 dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

Medical Image Analysis, 35, 2017.

Additionally, I will note that the authors also mention using a simulated dataset for training their model, which consists of 800 brain advection-diffusion time-series derived from the IXI brain dataset. However, since the IXI dataset is not cited in detail within the paper, I will need to look it up separately to provide a proper citation.

The citation for the IXI dataset is:
> IXI Dataset. Available for download: http://brain-development.org/ixi-dataset/.

Now, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **ISLES 2017 Dataset**: A public dataset used for ischemic stroke lesion segmentation, including 75 patients with dynamic susceptibility contrast MR perfusion images.
   - Citation: Oskar Maier et al. *ISLES 2015 - a public evaluation benchmark for ischemic stroke lesion segmentation from multispectral MRI medical image analysis*. Medical Image Analysis, 35, 2017.

2. **IXI Dataset**: A dataset used for simulating brain advection-diffusion dynamics, consisting of T1-/T2-weighted images, MRA, and diffusion-weighted images from 200 patients.
   - Citation: IXI Dataset. Available for download: http://brain-development.org/ixi-dataset/.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
