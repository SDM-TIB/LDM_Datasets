To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Benchmarking Generative Latent Variable Models for Speech" by Jakob D. Havtorn et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors benchmark various models on speech datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention three datasets: **TIMIT**, **LibriSpeech**, and **LibriLight**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including their characteristics and how they are used in the experiments.

1. **TIMIT Dataset**: The paper describes TIMIT as a speech dataset containing recordings of 630 speakers, with a total of approximately 3.94 hours of audio for training and 1.43 hours for testing. It includes phoneme annotations and speaker metadata.

2. **LibriSpeech Dataset**: This dataset consists of readings from public domain audiobooks, amounting to about 1000 hours of audio. The authors specifically mention using the 100-hour subset for their experiments.

3. **LibriLight Dataset**: This is a subset of LibriSpeech created for automatic speech recognition (ASR) benchmarks with limited or no supervision. The authors mention using the 10-hour subset for their experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **TIMIT**, the citation is:
  > Garofolo, J. S. TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus LDC93S1, 1993.

- For **LibriSpeech**, the citation is:
  > Panayotov, V., Chen, G., Povey, D., and Khudanpur, S. LibriSpeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 5206â€“5210, Brisbane, Australia, 2015.

- For **LibriLight**, the citation is:
  > Kahn, J., Riviere, M., Zheng, W., Kharitonov, E., Xu, Q., Mazare, P., Karadayi, J., Liptchinsky, V., Collobert, R., Fuegen, C., and al., e. Libri-light: A benchmark for ASR with limited or no supervision. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), Virtual, May 2020.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will summarize the findings and prepare to format them according to the required structure, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
