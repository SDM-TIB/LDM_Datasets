To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convergence of score-based generative modeling for general data distributions" by Holden Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the success of score-based generative modeling (SGM) but does not specify datasets. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets or data sources. If the authors describe their experimental setup, they may list the datasets used for training or evaluation.

In the **results section**, I will check for any references to datasets that were used to validate the findings of the research. The authors might mention specific datasets when discussing their results or comparing their methods to previous work.

Once I identify any datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, I would look for the citation, which might be something like:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: Canadian Institute for Advanced Research*. 2009.

If the authors used a custom dataset, I will note the details provided in the paper, including how it was collected, its size, and any relevant characteristics.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will create a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that the extracted information is clear and well-organized, ready for any further processing or review.
