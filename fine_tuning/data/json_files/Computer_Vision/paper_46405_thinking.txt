To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unfolded Algorithms for Deep Phase Retrieval" by Naveed Naimipour et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for specific phrases that indicate the use of datasets, such as "we used the following datasets" or "the experiments were conducted on." I will also check for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets used in the experiments.

Once I identify the datasets, I will take note of their names and any relevant details provided by the authors. For example, if the authors mention a dataset's size, the number of samples, or specific characteristics, I will record that information.

After gathering the dataset names and descriptions, I will consult the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is essential for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets.

For instance, if the authors mention using a dataset like "SPARTA" or "IRWF," I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets in detail. I will ensure to capture the full citation format, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper, maintaining a high standard of academic rigor.
