To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Stixel-based Instance Segmentation" by Monty Santarossa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a method called StixelPointNet for instance segmentation, which implies that datasets are likely involved in the evaluation of this method.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** (Section V), where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention using the **Cityscapes benchmark** and a derived dataset called **SD0.35**. 

1. **Cityscapes Dataset**: This is a well-known dataset for semantic urban scene understanding, consisting of 1525 images. The authors indicate that they used this dataset for their evaluations.

2. **SD0.35 Dataset**: This dataset is generated from the Cityscapes validation dataset, specifically designed for Stixel-level instance segmentation. It contains 495 images and is crucial for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Cityscapes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

- For the **SD0.35 Dataset**, since it is derived from the Cityscapes dataset and the authors created it for their specific research, I will cite it as follows:
  > Monty Santarossa, Lukas Schneider, Claudius Zelenka, Lars Schmarje, Reinhard Koch, and Uwe Franke. *Stixel-level Dataset SD0.35 for Instance Segmentation*. In Learning Stixel-based Instance Segmentation, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the names, descriptions, and citations of each dataset. This will ensure that the datasets are clearly documented and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
