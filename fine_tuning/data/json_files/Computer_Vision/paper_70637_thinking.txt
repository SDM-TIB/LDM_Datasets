To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Envision3D: One Image to 3D with Anchor Views Interpolation" by Yatian Pang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on the **GSO dataset** and various collected images. This indicates that there is at least one dataset explicitly referenced.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the introduction, the authors state that they evaluate their methods on the **GSO dataset** and various collected images. This suggests that the GSO dataset is a primary dataset used for evaluation.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide further details about their evaluation settings, confirming that they used the **GSO dataset** for their experiments. They also mention that they collected various images from the Internet or generated by text-to-image models for additional evaluation. However, the specific datasets used for these collected images are not detailed.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **GSO dataset**. The citation provided in the references is:

- **GSO dataset**: 
  > Downs, L., Francis, A., Koenig, N., Kinman, B., Hickman, R., Reymann, K., McHugh, T.B., Vanhoucke, V. (2022). *Google scanned objects: A high-quality dataset of 3D scanned household items*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pages 3-4.

Since the paper does not provide specific citations for the "various collected images," I will note that these are not formally cited datasets.

In summary, I will create an entry for the **GSO dataset** with its full citation. The collected images will be noted but not included as a formal dataset entry due to the lack of specific citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing.
