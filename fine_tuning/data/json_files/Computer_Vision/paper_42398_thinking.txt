To extract datasets from the research paper titled "REALM: Retrieval-Augmented Language Model Pre-Training" by Kelvin Guu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of REALM by fine-tuning on the task of Open-domain Question Answering (Open-QA) and compares against state-of-the-art models on three popular Open-QA benchmarks. This indicates that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.1 (Open-QA Benchmarks)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **NaturalQuestions-Open**: This dataset consists of naturally occurring Google queries and their answers, specifically focusing on short answer types with at most five tokens. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Kwiatkowski, T., Palomaki, J., Rhinehart, O., Collins, M., Parikh, A., Alberti, C., Epstein, D., Polosukhin, I., Kelcey, M., Devlin, J., et al. *Natural questions: a benchmark for question answering research*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2019.

2. **WebQuestions**: Collected from the Google Suggest API, this dataset expands a seed question into related questions. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Berant, J., Chou, A., Frostig, R., and Liang, P. *Semantic parsing on freebase from question-answer pairs*. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 1533–1544, 2013.

3. **CuratedTrec**: This dataset is a collection of question-answer pairs drawn from real user queries on various search sites. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Chen, D., Fisch, A., Weston, J., and Bordes, A. *Reading wikipedia to answer open-domain questions*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), volume 1, pp. 1870–1879, 2017.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their descriptions and citations accurately, as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for easy access and review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its citation for future reference.
