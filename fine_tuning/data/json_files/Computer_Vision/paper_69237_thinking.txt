To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DisDet: Exploring Detectability of Backdoor Attack on Diffusion Models" by Yang Sui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions empirical evaluations across various diffusion models and datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors evaluate their methods on two specific datasets: **CIFAR-10** and **CelebA**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were used in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the settings and configurations for their evaluations, specifically mentioning the CIFAR-10 dataset (32x32 images) and the CelebA dataset (64x64 images). They detail the attack modes used and the performance metrics evaluated, which reinforces the importance of these datasets in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations typically include the authors, title, publication venue, and year. For CIFAR-10, the citation is:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

For CelebA, the citation is:
> Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 3730â€“3738, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, characteristics, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
