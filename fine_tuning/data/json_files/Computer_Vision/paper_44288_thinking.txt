To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Malleable 2.5D Convolution: Learning Receptive Fields along the Depth-axis for RGB-D Scene Parsing" by Yajie Xing et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two RGB-D semantic segmentation datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will look for the names of the datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant statistics.

In section 4.1, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **NYUDv2**: This dataset is described as an indoor RGB-D semantic segmentation dataset containing 1,449 RGB-D images with pixel-wise labels. It provides depth maps captured by Kinect and includes camera intrinsic parameters. The dataset follows a standard split of 795 training images and 654 testing images.

2. **Cityscapes**: This dataset is characterized as an urban scene understanding dataset containing 5,000 stereo frames, each with a 2048 Ã— 1024 RGB image, a disparity map, and a fine-annotated 19-category ground truth label map. It includes 2,979 training images, 500 validation images, and 1,525 test images. The authors note that the quality of depth data in this dataset is not as good as in NYUDv2.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **NYUDv2**, the citation is:
  > Silberman, N., Hoiem, D., Kohli, P., & Fergus, R. (2012). Indoor segmentation and support inference from RGBD images. In *European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)* (Vol. 7576, pp. 746-760). Springer.

- For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:
  > Cordts, M., Omran, M., Ramos, S., Rehfeld, T., Enzweiler, M., Benenson, R., Franke, U., Roth, S., & Schiele, B. (2016). The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding. In *2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)* (pp. 3213-3223). IEEE.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
