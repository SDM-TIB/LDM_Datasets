To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Light Field Image Super-Resolution Using Deformable Convolution" by Yingqian Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the development of a novel LF dataset named **NUDT** to evaluate super-resolution performance under different disparity variations. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (The NUDT Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they describe the NUDT dataset as containing 32 synthetic scenes rendered using 3dsMax software, with an angular resolution of 9 × 9 and a spatial resolution of 1024 × 1024. They also mention that ground truth depth maps are available for LF depth estimation methods.

In this section, I will note the following key details about the NUDT dataset:
- **Name**: NUDT
- **Description**: A novel LF dataset with 32 synthetic scenes, rendered using 3dsMax, featuring an angular resolution of 9 × 9 and a spatial resolution of 1024 × 1024. Ground truth depth maps are included.
- **Purpose**: To evaluate LF image super-resolution methods under varying disparity conditions.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the NUDT dataset. However, since the NUDT dataset is self-developed by the authors, it may not have a separate citation in the references. Instead, I will note that the dataset is introduced in this paper and can be referenced as follows:

- For the NUDT dataset, the citation is:
  > Yingqian Wang, Jungang Yang, Longguang Wang, Xinyi Ying, Tianhao Wu, Wei An, and Yulan Guo. "Light Field Image Super-Resolution Using Deformable Convolution." *IEEE Transactions on Image Processing*, vol. XX, no. XX, pp. XX-XX, 2023.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the NUDT dataset as it is crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work.

After completing this process, I will have successfully extracted the relevant dataset information from the paper, ready for further use or analysis.
