To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SeeSR: Towards Semantics-Aware Real-World Image Super-Resolution" by Rongyuan Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of "real-world LR-HR image pairs" and references various datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their training and testing datasets in **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**. Here, they mention the following datasets:

1. **LSDIR**: This dataset is referenced as a large-scale dataset for image restoration. The authors state that they trained SeeSR on LSDIR.
   
2. **FFHQ**: The authors mention using the first 10K face images from the FFHQ dataset for training.

3. **DIV2K**: The authors describe how they randomly cropped 3K patches from the DIV2K validation set for testing.

4. **RealSR**: This dataset is used for testing and is mentioned as a real-world dataset.

5. **DRealSR**: Another real-world dataset used for testing.

6. **RealLR200**: This dataset is built from various sources, including LR images from recent literature and images collected from the internet.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation for proper referencing. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
