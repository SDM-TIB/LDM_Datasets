To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ada3Diff: Defending against 3D Adversarial Point Clouds via Adaptive Diffusion" by Kui Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments to showcase the effectiveness of their method on different datasets. This indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention using **ModelNet40** and **ShapeNet Part** datasets for their experiments. 

1. **ModelNet40**: This dataset is described as containing 12,311 CAD models across 40 semantic categories, with 2,468 models designated for testing. This is a well-known dataset in the field of 3D point cloud recognition.

2. **ShapeNet Part**: This dataset consists of 16 categories with 16,846 objects, of which 2,874 are used for testing. It is also a widely recognized dataset for evaluating 3D shape analysis.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **ModelNet40**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Zhirong, et al. "3D ShapeNets: A deep representation for volumetric shapes." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015.

- For **ShapeNet Part**, the citation is:
  > Yi, Li, et al. "A scalable active framework for region annotation in 3D shape collections." ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG) 35, no. 6 (2016): 1-12.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the datasets are clearly documented and easily accessible for future reference.
