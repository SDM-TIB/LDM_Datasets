To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automated Bi-Fold Weighted Ensemble Algorithms and its Application to Brain Tumor Detection and Classification" by PoTsang B. Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves multiple datasets for training and evaluation, which suggests that I should find specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Proposed Methodology)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used in their research. They state that the dataset is a combination of three datasets: **figshare**, **SARTAJ**, and **Br35H**. I will note the details provided about each dataset:

1. **Figshare Dataset**: This dataset contains a total of 3064 weighted images categorized into three folders: meningioma, glioma, and pituitary tumors.

2. **SARTAJ Dataset**: This dataset includes 926 gliomas, 937 meningiomas, 896 pituitaries, and 500 no-tumor images.

3. **Br35H Dataset**: This dataset contributes 1500 images each to two folders: tumor and no tumor.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **figshare dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cheng, Jun (2017). *brain tumor dataset*. figshare. Dataset. https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1512427.v5

- For the **SARTAJ dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sartaj, (2020). *Brain tumor classification (MRI)*. https://github.com/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-dataset

- For the **Br35H dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hamada, A. (2021). *Brain tumor detection*. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedhamada0/brain-tumor-detection

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
