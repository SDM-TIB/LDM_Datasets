To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RQAT-INR: Improved Implicit Neural Image Compression" by Bharath Bhushan Damodaran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses improvements in image compression methods but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (section 4), where the authors compare their method against competitors. Here, they mention using the **Kodak dataset** for their experiments. This is a clear indication that a dataset is involved, and I need to gather more details about it.

In the **references section**, I will look for the full citation of the Kodak dataset. The paper cites it as:
> Eastman Kodak, “Kodak Lossless True Color Image Suite (PhotoCD PCD0992),” .

This citation provides the necessary information to reference the dataset properly.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Kodak Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of evaluating the performance of the proposed image compression method. It is known for its high-quality images and is commonly used in image processing research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or processing.
