To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convolutional Neural Networks: Basic Concepts and Applications in Manufacturing" by Shengli Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and case studies sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a general overview, but the introduction and case studies are likely to contain specific details about datasets used in the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various applications of CNNs in manufacturing, but they do not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the **case studies section**, which is where datasets are most likely to be detailed.

1. **Case Study on Detecting Contaminants in Solution**: The authors mention using a dataset derived from flow cytometry data to train a CNN for detecting endotoxins. They describe the dataset as consisting of complex data objects in the form of scatter point clouds, which are converted into 2D grid data objects. However, they do not provide a formal citation for this dataset.

2. **Case Study on Detecting Contaminants in Air**: This case study references a dataset obtained from six videos showing the response of liquid crystals to different gaseous streams. The total number of microwell snapshots generated was 75,081. The authors do not provide a formal citation for this dataset either.

3. **Case Study on Predicting Critical Micelle Concentrations**: The authors mention gathering experimental CMC data for 202 surfactants, but again, no formal citation is provided for this dataset.

4. **Case Study on Decoding Spectra**: The authors describe using ATR-FTIR spectra collected from various plastic materials, but they do not provide a formal citation for this dataset.

5. **Case Study on Multivariate Process Monitoring**: The authors mention using benchmark data for the Tennessee-Eastman process, which is a well-known dataset in the field. The dataset is referenced as being obtained from the Harvard Dataverse, which is a formal citation.

Next, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **Tennessee-Eastman process dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. A. Rieth, B. D. Amsel, R. Tran, and M. B. Cook. *Additional Tennessee Eastman Process Simulation Data for Anomaly Detection Evaluation*, 2017. Available at Harvard Dataverse.

For the other datasets mentioned in the case studies, since they do not have formal citations provided in the paper, I will note that they are referenced but lack specific bibliographic details.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and ensure that I have documented the datasets clearly, including any relevant citations where available. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research paper.
