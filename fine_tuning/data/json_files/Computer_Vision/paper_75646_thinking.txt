To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating Graph-Based Explanations for AI-Based Recommender Systems" by Simon Delarue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methodologies, which may include mentions of datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, potentially naming specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In many research papers, authors will explicitly outline the datasets they used for their experiments in a specific section. I will pay close attention to any descriptions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the paper includes a **methodology or experiments section**, I will review it thoroughly to identify any datasets mentioned during the description of the experimental setup. This section often contains detailed information about how the datasets were utilized in the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for readers who may wish to access the datasets themselves.

For example, if the paper mentions using a dataset like the "MovieLens dataset," I would look for the original source of this dataset in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> F. Maxwell, "MovieLens: A Dataset for Recommender Systems," in Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, 2000.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and structured manner, ready for further processing or presentation.
