To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Polyp-SAM++: Can A Text Guided SAM Perform Better for Polyp Segmentation?" by Risab Biswas, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study evaluates a model on benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments and Results)**, particularly the **subsection 3.1 (Datasets)**, where the author explicitly lists the datasets used for evaluation. Here, I find three datasets mentioned:

1. **Kvasir-SEG**: This dataset contains 1000 pairs of images from colonoscopy procedures, where polyps are present along with their ground truth segmentation masks. The dataset is collected by Vestre Viken Health Trust, Norway.

2. **CVC-300**: This dataset consists of 60 images containing polyps, with a resolution of 500 × 574 pixels.

3. **CVC-ClinicDB**: This dataset includes 612 images collected from various colonoscopy videos, with a resolution of 288 × 384 pixels.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Kvasir-SEG**, the citation is:
  > D. Jha, P. H. Smedsrud, M. A. Riegler, P. Halvorsen, T. de Lange, D. Johansen, and H. D. Johansen. *Kvasir-seg: A segmented polyp dataset*. In International Conference on Multimedia Modeling. Springer, 2020, pp. 451–462.

- For **CVC-300**, the citation is:
  > D. Vázquez, J. Bernal, F. J. Sánchez, G. Fernández-Esparrach, A. M. López, A. Romero, M. Drozdzal, and A. Courville. *A benchmark for endoluminal scene segmentation of colonoscopy images*. Journal of Healthcare Engineering, pp. 1–9, 2017.

- For **CVC-ClinicDB**, the citation is:
  > J. Bernal, F. J. Sánchez, G. Fernández-Esparrach, D. Gil, C. Rodríguez, and F. Vilariño. *WM-DOVA maps for accurate polyp highlighting in colonoscopy: Validation vs. saliency maps from physicians*. Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics, vol. 43, pp. 99–111, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
