To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Confidence Thresholding for Monocular Depth Estimation" by Hyesong Choi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses leveraging pseudo ground truth depth maps generated from stereo images, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the use of self-supervised learning and refer to existing datasets. I will look for specific names of datasets that are used for training or evaluation.

In the **methods section**, I will pay particular attention to any subsections that explicitly mention datasets. For example, the authors refer to the **KITTI dataset** and the **Cityscapes dataset** as sources of stereo images and ground truth depth maps. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and how they are utilized in the experiments.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used for evaluation and any additional datasets that may be mentioned. The authors often provide insights into the datasets' sizes, types, and the specific tasks they are used for.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. For instance, the KITTI dataset is cited as:
> Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, Christoph Stiller, and Raquel Urtasun. *Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, 32(11):1231–1237, 2013.

And the Cityscapes dataset is cited as:
> Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The Cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3213–3223, 2016.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and full citations, ensuring that I present them clearly and accurately for any further processing or review.
