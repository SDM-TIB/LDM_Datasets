To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Introspective Deep Metric Learning for Image Retrieval" by Wenzhao Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that their framework achieves state-of-the-art results on three widely used datasets for image retrieval: **CUB-200-2011**, **Cars196**, and **Stanford Online Products**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to find detailed descriptions of these datasets. In section 4.2, the authors provide specific information about each dataset:

1. **CUB-200-2011**: This dataset contains 11,788 images of 200 bird species. The authors used the first 100 species with 5,864 images for training and the remaining 100 species with 5,924 images for testing.

2. **Cars196**: This dataset includes 16,183 images of 196 car models. The authors used the first 96 classes with 8,054 images for training and the remaining 98 classes with 8,131 images for testing.

3. **Stanford Online Products**: This dataset is larger, containing 120,053 images of 22,634 products. The authors used the first 11,318 products with 59,551 images for training and the remaining 11,318 products with 60,502 images for testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CUB-200-2011**:
  > Catherine Wah, Steve Branson, Peter Welinder, Pietro Perona, and Serge J. Belongie. *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset*. Technical Report CNS-TR-2011-001, California Institute of Technology, 2011.

- For **Cars196**:
  > Jonathan Krause, Michael Stark, Jia Deng, and Li Fei-Fei. *3D Object Representations for Fine-Grained Categorization*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCVW), pages 554–561, 2013.

- For **Stanford Online Products**:
  > Hyun Oh Song, Yu Xiang, Stefanie Jegelka, and Silvio Savarese. *Deep Metric Learning via Lifted Structured Feature Embedding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 4004–4012, 2016.

With this information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in organizing the extracted data effectively for further use or analysis.
