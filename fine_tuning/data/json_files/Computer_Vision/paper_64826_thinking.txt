To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Data-driven Volumetric Prior for Few-shot Ultra High-resolution Face Synthesis" by Marcel C. Bühler et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a "novel volumetric human face prior" trained on a dataset of low-resolution multi-view images, which indicates that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they created. They describe their dataset as containing 1450 different subjects captured under uniform illumination with 13 camera views distributed across the frontal hemisphere. This section will provide the necessary details about the dataset, including its size, characteristics, and purpose.

In addition, the authors mention using the **Facescape dataset** for evaluation purposes. I will note this as it is a publicly available dataset that is relevant to their work.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for both datasets:

1. **The dataset created by the authors**:
   - The citation for this dataset is not explicitly provided in the references, but I can summarize its details based on the information in the paper:
     > Bühler, M. C., Sarkar, K., Shah, T., Li, G., Wang, D., Helminger, L., Hilliges, O., Orts-Escolano, S., Lagun, D., Beeler, T., Meka, A. (2023). *A Data-driven Volumetric Prior for Few-shot Ultra High-resolution Face Synthesis*. Retrieved from https://syntec-research.github.io/Preface

2. **Facescape dataset**:
   - The citation for the Facescape dataset is:
     > Yang, H., Zhu, H., Wang, Y., Huang, M., Shen, Q., Yang, R., & Cao, X. (2020). *Facescape: A large-scale high quality 3D face dataset and detailed riggable 3D face prediction*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research.
