To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic Autoencoder for Zero-Shot Learning" by Elyor Kodirov, Tao Xiang, and Shaogang Gong, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. They mention six benchmark datasets, which are:

1. **Animals with Attributes (AwA)**: This dataset is used for zero-shot learning and contains 85 classes with a total of 40 instances for seen classes and 10 for unseen classes.

2. **CUB-200-2011 Birds (CUB)**: This dataset consists of 30,475 images across 200 bird species, with 150 instances for seen classes and 50 for unseen classes.

3. **aPascal&Yahoo (aP&Y)**: This dataset includes 312 classes with 20 instances for seen classes and 12 for unseen classes.

4. **SUN Attribute (SUN)**: This dataset has 11,788 images across 645 classes, with a split of 645 for seen classes and 72 for unseen classes.

5. **ILSVRC2010 (ImNet-1)**: This dataset is part of the ImageNet challenge and contains 1,000 classes with 1,000 instances for seen classes.

6. **ILSVRC2012 (ImNet-2)**: Another part of the ImageNet challenge, this dataset has 218,000 images across 1,000 classes, with 1,000 instances for seen classes and 360 for unseen classes.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
