To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tri-Perspective View Decomposition for Geometry-Aware Depth Completion" by Zhiqiang Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract states that the authors built a novel depth completion dataset named **TOFDC**, which is a strong indication that this dataset will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the authors provide context for their work. Here, they mention the limitations of existing datasets and highlight the importance of creating a new dataset for depth completion, specifically mentioning **TOFDC** again.

I will then look at the **experiments** section, particularly the subsection titled **5.1. Datasets**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. They mention:

1. **TOFDC**: This dataset consists of 10,000 RGB-D pairs collected using a smartphone with a TOF sensor and a color camera. It includes various scenes such as texture, flower, body, and toy, under different lighting conditions. The dataset is split into 10,000 training samples and 560 evaluation samples.

2. **KITTI Dataset**: This dataset contains 86,898 training samples and 1,000 validation samples, collected using a LiDAR sensor. The authors note that the RGB-D pairs are cropped for processing.

3. **NYUv2 Dataset**: This dataset consists of paired RGB-D images from 464 indoor scenes, with 50,000 samples for training and 654 for testing. The depth maps are acquired using a Kinect sensor.

4. **SUN RGBD Dataset**: This dataset includes 555 samples captured by a Kinect V1 and 3,389 samples from an Asus Xtion camera.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **TOFDC**, since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:

- For **KITTI Dataset**, the citation is:

- For **NYUv2 Dataset**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
