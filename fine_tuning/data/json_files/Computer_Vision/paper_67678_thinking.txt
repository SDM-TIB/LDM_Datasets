To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EZ-CLIP: Efficient Zero-Shot Video Action Recognition" by Shahzad Ahmad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **five different benchmark datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention:

1. **Kinetics-400**: This dataset comprises 400 human action classes, with approximately 240,000 training videos and 20,000 validation videos sourced from YouTube.
2. **Kinetics-600**: An extension of Kinetics-400, this dataset includes 600 action categories, with about 410,000 training video clips and 29,000 validation video clips.
3. **HMDB-51**: This dataset contains 71,000 realistic videos across 51 action categories, with a standard split of 3,570 training samples and 1,530 validation samples.
4. **UCF-101**: Comprising 13,000 videos from 101 action categories, this dataset has a standard split of 9,537 training videos and 3,783 validation videos.
5. **Something-Something V2 (SSv2)**: This dataset includes 174 action categories, focusing on fine-grained actions, with 168,913 training videos and 24,777 validation videos.

I will then verify the **References section** to obtain the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help in organizing the datasets for further analysis or processing.
