To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DECDM: Document Enhancement using Cycle-Consistent Diffusion Models" by Jiaxin Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors compare their method on "multiple synthetic data and benchmark datasets," which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. In **section 3.1**, the authors describe two datasets used for denoising tasks:

1. **DatasetA: Dirty Document**: This dataset consists of printed English words in 18 different fonts, with 144 samples for training and 72 for testing. The authors provide a visual example of a raw document-level image and its corresponding clean image.

2. **DatasetB: Noisy Document**: This dataset is created by adding speckle noise and Gaussian noise to the ground truth images from DatasetA. The noise follows a specific distribution, and the authors illustrate the noisy document-level images.

In **section 3.3**, the authors discuss datasets used for document shadow removal, listing five datasets:

- **SDSRD datasets**: 8309 paired images from 970 documents, with 7533 for training and 776 for testing.
- **RDSRD datasets**: 540 paired images of 25 documents under various lighting conditions.
- **Shadow Map (SM) datasets**: 81 paired images with light shadows/text.
- **DEVD datasets**: 300 paired document-level images with dark shadows and colorful symbols.
- **Water-Filling datasets**: 87 high-quality paired images including multi-cast shadows.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets, but I can infer the following based on the context:

- For **DatasetA** and **DatasetB**, the authors reference a Kaggle competition for denoising dirty documents, which can be cited as:
  > Denoising Dirty Documents. *Kaggle Competition*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/denoising-dirty-documents.

- For the **SDSRD datasets**, the citation is:

- For the **Shadow Map datasets**, the citation is:
  > Steve Bako et al. *Removing Shadows from Images of Documents*. In Asian Conference on Computer Vision, pages 173–183. Springer, 2016.

- For the **DEVD datasets**, the citation is:
  > Netanel Kligler, Sagi Katz, and Ayellet Tal. *Document Enhancement Using Visibility Detection*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 2374–2382, 2018.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for clarity and future reference. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
