To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fully Convolutional Line Parsing" by Xili Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that significant progress in line detection has been made due to the introduction of a large-scale dataset. This indicates that datasets are crucial to their research, prompting me to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and testing their models. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **ShanghaiTech Wireframe Dataset**: This dataset contains 5,000 training images and 462 testing images of man-made scenes. It is used for evaluating the performance of their proposed method.

2. **York Urban Dataset**: A smaller dataset containing 102 images, used to evaluate the generalizability of the methods.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **ShanghaiTech Wireframe Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kun Huang, Yifan Wang, Zihan Zhou, Tianjiao Ding, Shenghua Gao, and Yi Ma. *Learning to parse wireframes in images of man-made environments*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 626–635, 2018.

- For the **York Urban Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Patrick Denis, James H Elder, and Francisco J Estrada. *Efficient edge-based methods for estimating manhattan frames in urban imagery*. In European conference on computer vision, pages 197–210. Springer, 2008.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
