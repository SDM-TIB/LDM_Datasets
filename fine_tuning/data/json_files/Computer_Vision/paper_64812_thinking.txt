To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepPCR: Parallelizing Sequential Operations in Neural Networks" by Federico Danieli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of DeepPCR to various neural network operations, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction may provide context on the datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Results)**, where the authors describe their experiments. In **section 4.2**, they mention using the **MNIST dataset** for training ResNet architectures. This is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit classification, which is crucial for their experiments.

In **section 4.3**, the authors mention applying DeepPCR to accelerate image generation in diffusion models trained on **MNIST**, **CIFAR-10**, and **CelebA** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are also used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digit Images for Machine Learning Research*. 2010. [Link](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, University of Toronto, 2009. [Link](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

3. **CelebA Dataset**:
   > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3730â€“3738, 2015. [Link](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets mentioned in the paper.
