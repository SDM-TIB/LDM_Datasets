To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CT-GLIP: 3D Grounded Language-Image Pretraining with CT Scans and Radiology Reports for Full-Body Scenarios" by Jingyang Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors have developed a multimodal dataset of CT images and reports, which suggests that there is a dataset to extract.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenges of existing methods focusing on 2D images and highlight their goal of expanding to 3D images. They introduce CT-GLIP and mention a multimodal dataset, but I need to find specific details about this dataset.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used for pretraining. They state that they curated a multimodal CT image-report dataset comprising **44,011 organ-level vision-text pairs from 17,702 patients covering 104 organs**. This is a significant dataset, and I will note its details.

Additionally, the authors mention the creation of validation and test datasets with **643 and 1,130 patients**, respectively, targeting **16 common abnormalities across 7 organs**. This information is crucial as it indicates the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the dataset is a novel creation by the authors, it may not have a separate citation. Instead, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Jingyang Lin, Yingda Xia, Jianpeng Zhang, Ke Yan, Le Lu, Jiebo Luo, and Ling Zhang. *CT-GLIP: 3D Grounded Language-Image Pretraining with CT Scans and Radiology Reports for Full-Body Scenarios*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2023.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:
1. **CT Image-Report Dataset**: A multimodal dataset containing 44,011 organ-level vision-text pairs from 17,702 patients across 104 organs.
2. **Validation Dataset**: Contains 643 patients.
3. **Test Dataset**: Contains 1,130 patients, focusing on 16 common abnormalities across 7 organs.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
