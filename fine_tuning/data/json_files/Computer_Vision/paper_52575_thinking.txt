To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Latent Image Animator: Learning to Animate Images via Latent Space Navigation" by Yaohui Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on several datasets, specifically mentioning **VoxCeleb**, **TaichiHD**, and **TED-talk**. This is a good starting point.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about these datasets. The introduction reiterates the use of these datasets for training and evaluation, confirming their importance in the experiments.

I will then look into the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection titled **Datasets**. Here, the authors provide specific details about each dataset:

1. **VoxCeleb**: This dataset consists of a large number of interview videos featuring various celebrities. The authors mention that they extracted frames and cropped them to a resolution of 256 × 256. The dataset includes 17,928 training videos and 495 test videos.

2. **TaichiHD**: This dataset contains videos of full human bodies performing Tai Chi actions. The authors follow a pre-processing method to crop the videos into 256 × 256 resolution, with 1,096 training videos and 115 testing videos.

3. **TED-talk**: This dataset includes TED-talk videos where the main subjects have been cropped out. The authors resized the original videos to 256 × 256 resolution, comprising 1,124 training videos and 130 testing videos.

After gathering this information, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **VoxCeleb**, the citation is:
  > Arsha Nagrani, Joon Son Chung, Weidi Xie, and Andrew Zisserman. *Voxceleb: Large-scale speaker verification in the wild*. Computer Science and Language, 2019.

- For **TaichiHD**, the citation is:
  > Aliaksandr Siarohin, Stéphane Lathuilière, Sergey Tulyakov, Elisa Ricci, and Nicu Sebe. *First order motion model for image animation*. In NeurIPS, 2019.

- For **TED-talk**, the citation is:
  > Aliaksandr Siarohin, Oliver Woodford, Jian Ren, Menglei Chai, and Sergey Tulyakov. *Motion representations for articulated animation*. In CVPR, 2021.

Now that I have the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
