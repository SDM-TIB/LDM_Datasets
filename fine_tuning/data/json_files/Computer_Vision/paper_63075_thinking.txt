To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Hidden Dance of Phonemes and Visage: Unveiling the Enigmatic Link between Phonemes and Facial Features" by Liao Qu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on the relationship between phonemes and facial features, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the motivation behind the research and mentions previous studies but does not specify any datasets.

Moving on to **section 4 (Experiments)**, I will focus on **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention a **private audio-visual dataset D** that contains paired voice recordings and scanned 3D facial shapes from 1,026 individuals. Each recording consists of general phonemes and sentences lasting 1-2 minutes, and the facial data includes 6,790 3D-coordinate points.

Since the dataset is described as private, I will note that it may not be publicly accessible, but I will still document it as it is crucial for understanding the research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, since the dataset is private and not attributed to any external source, there will be no formal citation available for it.

In summary, I will create an entry for the dataset based on the information provided in the paper:

1. **Private Audio-Visual Dataset D**: Contains 1,026 individuals' paired voice recordings and scanned 3D facial shapes, with each recording being 1-2 minutes long and consisting of general phonemes and sentences.

Since there is no formal citation for this dataset, I will note that it is a private dataset without a specific reference.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
