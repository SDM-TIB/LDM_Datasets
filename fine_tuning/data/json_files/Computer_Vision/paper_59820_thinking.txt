To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SparseNeRF: Distilling Depth Ranking for Few-shot Novel View Synthesis" by Guangcong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new dataset called **NVS-RGBD**, which is a strong indication that there are datasets to extract. The introduction further emphasizes the significance of this dataset in the context of their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section, which is typically where authors describe the datasets used in their research. In this paper, the relevant information about the datasets is found in **section 4 (NVS-RGBD Dataset)**. Here, the authors provide a detailed description of the NVS-RGBD dataset, including the sources of the depth maps (Azure Kinect, ZED 2, and iPhone 13 Pro) and the number of scenes collected.

The authors also mention two other datasets used for comparison in their experiments: **LLFF** and **DTU**. I will need to gather information about these datasets as well.

1. **NVS-RGBD Dataset**: This dataset contains real-world depth maps captured by consumer-level depth sensors, including Azure Kinect, ZED 2, and iPhone 13 Pro. The authors collected 8 scenes for both Azure Kinect and ZED 2, and 4 scenes for iPhone 13 Pro. The dataset is designed for few-shot novel view synthesis.

2. **LLFF Dataset**: The authors refer to the LLFF dataset as a popular benchmark for NeRFs, which contains 8 complex forward-facing scenes. 

3. **DTU Dataset**: This dataset is described as an object-level dataset, which is used in their experiments alongside the NVS-RGBD dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **NVS-RGBD Dataset**, since it is a new dataset introduced by the authors, I will cite it as follows:
  > Wang, G., Chen, Z., Loy, C. C., & Liu, Z. (2023). *NVS-RGBD: A dataset for few-shot novel view synthesis with real-world depth maps*. Available at: https://sparsenerf.github.io/

- For the **LLFF Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mildenhall, B., Srinivasan, P. P., Ortiz-Cayon, R., Khademi Kalantari, N., Ramamoorthi, R., Ng, R., & Kar, A. (2019). *Local light field fusion: Practical view synthesis with prescriptive sampling guidelines*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 38(4), 1-14.

- For the **DTU Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jensen, R., Dahl, A., Vogiatzis, G., Tola, E., & Aan√¶s, H. (2014). *Large scale multi-view stereopsis evaluation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (pp. 406-413).

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
