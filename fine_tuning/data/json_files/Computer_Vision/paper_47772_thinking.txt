To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PDO-eS2CNNs: Partial Differential Operator Based Equivariant Spherical CNNs" by Zhengyang Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed method on various tasks, which may indicate the presence of datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where datasets are typically described. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their method on three datasets: **Spherical MNIST**, **Stanford 2D-3D-S**, and **QM7**. I will look for specific details about each dataset, such as the number of samples, types of data, and any preprocessing steps mentioned.

1. **Spherical MNIST**: The authors state that they prepared non-rotated and rotated training and testing tasks from the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. This dataset is used for classification tasks.

2. **Stanford 2D-3D-S**: This dataset contains 1,413 equirectangular images with RGB+depth channels and semantic labels across 13 different classes. The authors mention using this dataset for omnidirectional image segmentation tasks.

3. **QM7**: The QM7 dataset is used for atomization energy prediction and contains 7,165 molecules, each with atomic positions and charges. The authors describe how they represent each molecule as a spherical signal.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Spherical MNIST**: 
  > Cohen, T. S., Geiger, M., Kohler, J., & Welling, M. (2018). Spherical CNNs. In ICLR.

- **Stanford 2D-3D-S**: 
  > Armeni, I., Sax, A., Zamir, A. R., & Savarese, S. (2017). Joint 2D-3D-Semantic Data for Indoor Scene Understanding. ArXiv e-prints.

- **QM7**:

Now that I have gathered all necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations.
