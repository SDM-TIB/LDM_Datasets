To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Object-Conditioned Bag of Instances for Few-Shot Personalized Instance Recognition" by Umberto Michieli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for personalized instance-level detection and mention the use of few-shot datasets. However, I need to locate specific dataset names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **Datasets section** (which is likely to be in the methods or experimental results sections). Here, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **CORe50**: The authors describe this dataset as containing a subset of 45 personal instances belonging to 9 object-level classes, acquired over 11 variable-background sequences.

2. **iCubWorld Transformations (iCWT)**: This dataset includes a subset of 9 object-level classes with 10 personal instances each, acquired under 5 sequences with diverse affine transformations.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CORe50**, the citation is:
  > Vincenzo Lomonaco and Davide Maltoni. *CORe50: A New Dataset and Benchmark for Continuous Object Recognition*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL), 2017, pp. 17–26.

- For **iCubWorld Transformations (iCWT)**, the citation is:
  > Giulia Pasquale, Carlo Ciliberto, Francesca Odone, Lorenzo Rosasco, and Lorenzo Natale. *Are We Done with Object Recognition? The iCub Robot’s Perspective*. Robotics and Autonomous Systems, vol. 112, pp. 260–281, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
