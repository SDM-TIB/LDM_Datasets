To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IC-FPS: Instance-Centroid Faster Point Sampling Module for 3D Point-based Object Detection" by Haotian Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on multiple public benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges of 3D object detection and reference the **Waymo dataset** as a benchmark for their experiments. This indicates that the Waymo dataset is likely one of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, particularly in **section 4**, the authors provide details about their experiments. They mention that they conducted experiments on the **Waymo dataset**, which contains 160K samples in the training set and 40K samples in the validation set. They also refer to the **nuScenes dataset**, which contains 40K annotated keyframes with 23 object categories. Additionally, they mention the **ONCE dataset**, which includes 1 million 3D scenes and 7 million corresponding 2D images.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Waymo dataset**, the citation is:
   > Pei Sun, Henrik Kretzschmar, Xerxes Dotiwalla, Aurelien Chouard, Vijaysai Patnaik, Paul Tsui, James Guo, Yin Zhou, Yuning Chai, Benjamin Caine, et al. *Scalability in perception for autonomous driving: Waymo open dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 2446–2454, 2020.

2. For the **nuScenes dataset**, the citation is:
   > Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yu Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *nuscenes: A multi-modal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 11621–11631, 2020.

3. For the **ONCE dataset**, the citation is:
   > Jiageng Mao, Minzhe Niu, Chenhan Jiang, Xiaodan Liang, Yamin Li, Chaoqiang Ye, Wei Zhang, Zhenguo Li, Jie Yu, and Chunjiang Xu. *One million scenes for autonomous driving: ONCE dataset*. 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
