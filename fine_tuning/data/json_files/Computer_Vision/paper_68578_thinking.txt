To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Motion2VecSets: 4D Latent Vector Set Diffusion for Non-rigid Shape Reconstruction and Tracking" by Wei Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. In the abstract, the authors discuss their method's performance on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used in their research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Dynamic FAUST (D-FAUST)**: This dataset is described as focusing on human body dynamics, containing 10 subjects and 129 sequences, with a specific split for training, validation, and testing.

2. **DeformingThings4D-Animals (DT4D-A)**: This dataset includes 38 identities with a total of 1227 animations, also divided into training, validation, and test subsets.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Dynamic FAUST (D-FAUST)**, the citation is:
  > Federica Bogo, Javier Romero, Gerard Pons-Moll, and Michael J. Black. *Dynamic FAUST: Registering human bodies in motion*. In IEEE Conf. on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

- For **DeformingThings4D-Animals (DT4D-A)**, the citation is:
  > Yang Li, Hikari Takehara, Takafumi Taketomi, Bo Zheng, and Matthias Nie√üner. *4DComplete: Non-rigid motion estimation beyond the observable surface*. IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset, ensuring to include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.
