To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning representations that are closed-form Monge mapping optimal with application to domain adaptation" by Oliver Struckmeier et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the application of optimal transport (OT) in domain adaptation, which may imply the use of specific datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is typically where datasets are explicitly mentioned. In this paper, the authors evaluate their method on two datasets:

1. **Office/Caltech10 Dataset**: This dataset consists of images from four different domains (Amazon, Caltech, Webcam, and DSLR) across 10 overlapping classes. The paper states that it contains 958 images from Amazon, 1123 from Caltech, 295 from Webcam, and 157 from DSLR.

2. **Visual Domain Adaptation (VisDA) Dataset**: This dataset is used for large-scale domain adaptation tasks and contains high-dimensional image data across 12 classes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and should be formatted correctly.

For the **Office/Caltech10 Dataset**, the citation is:
> Saenko, K., Kulis, B., Fritz, M., & Darrell, T. (2010). Adapting visual category models to new domains. In *European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)*, pp. 213-226.

For the **VisDA Dataset**, the citation is:
> Peng, X., Usman, B., Kaushik, N., Hoffman, J., Wang, D., & Saenko, K. (2017). Visda: The visual domain adaptation challenge. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.06924*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
