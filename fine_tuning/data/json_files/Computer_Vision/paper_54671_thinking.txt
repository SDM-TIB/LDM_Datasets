To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Medical Image Translation with Adversarial Diffusion Models" by Muzaffer Özbey et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive assessments on multi-contrast MRI and MRI-CT translation, suggesting that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Methods)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe three datasets:

1. **IXI Dataset**: This dataset consists of T1-, T2-, and PD-weighted images from 40 healthy subjects, with a specific split for training, validation, and testing. The authors provide details about the number of subjects in each split and the imaging parameters used.

2. **BRATS Dataset**: This dataset includes T1-, T2-, and Fluid Attenuation Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) weighted brain MR images from 55 glioma patients, also with a defined split for training, validation, and testing. The authors mention the number of subjects in each split and the imaging parameters.

3. **Pelvic MRI-CT Dataset**: This dataset comprises pelvic T1-, T2-weighted MRI, and CT images from 15 subjects, with a specified split for training, validation, and testing. The authors provide details about the number of subjects in each split and the imaging parameters.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For the **IXI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > "IXI Dataset." Available: https://brain-development.org/ixi-dataset/

- For the **BRATS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Menze, B. H., Jakab, A., Bauer, S., Kalpathy-Cramer, J., Farahani, K., Kirby, J., et al. (2015). "The multimodal brain tumor image segmentation benchmark (BRATS)." *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 34(10), 1993-2024.

- For the **Pelvic MRI-CT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nyholm, T., Svensson, S., Andersson, S., Jonsson, J., Sohlin, M., Gustafsson, C., et al. (2018). "MR and CT data with multiobserver delineations of organs in the pelvic area—part of the gold atlas project." *Medical Physics*, 45(3), 1295-1300.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all necessary information regarding the datasets used in the study.
