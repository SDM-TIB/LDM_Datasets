To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Sequential-Diffusion Learning: An approach to Multi-Scene Instructional Video Synthesis" by Vasco Ramos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments with real-world data, which suggests that datasets are involved. The introduction discusses the need for instructional videos and references various sources, indicating that datasets may be derived from these sources.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors describe their dataset in **section 4 (Experimental Setting)**. They mention that they compiled a dataset consisting of publicly available manual tasks from the recipes domain sourced from **AllRecipes** and DIY manual tasks from **WikiHow**. This is a clear indication of the datasets used.

The paper specifies that the dataset includes approximately **1,400 tasks**, with an average of **4.9 steps per task**, totaling **6,860 individual steps**. Each task includes a title, description, list of ingredients/resources, tools, and a sequence of step-by-step instructions. This detailed description provides a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's structure and content.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific citations for AllRecipes or WikiHow, as they are well-known platforms. However, I can still note their significance in the context of the dataset.

For the **AllRecipes** dataset, I will use the following citation:
> AllRecipes. *AllRecipes: Recipe and Cooking Ideas*. [https://www.allrecipes.com](https://www.allrecipes.com).

For the **WikiHow** dataset, I will use:
> WikiHow. *WikiHow: How-to Instructions*. [https://www.wikihow.com](https://www.wikihow.com).

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Dataset Name**: AllRecipes Dataset
   - **Description**: A collection of publicly available manual tasks in the recipes domain, including titles, descriptions, ingredients, tools, and step-by-step instructions.
   - **Citation**: AllRecipes. *AllRecipes: Recipe and Cooking Ideas*. [https://www.allrecipes.com](https://www.allrecipes.com).

2. **Dataset Name**: WikiHow Dataset
   - **Description**: A collection of DIY manual tasks sourced from WikiHow, including titles, descriptions, and step-by-step instructions.
   - **Citation**: WikiHow. *WikiHow: How-to Instructions*. [https://www.wikihow.com](https://www.wikihow.com).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
