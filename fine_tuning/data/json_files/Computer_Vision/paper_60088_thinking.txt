To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lidar-Assisted Acquisition of Mobile Airborne FSO Terminals in a GPS-Denied Environment" by Heyou Liu, Muhammad Salman Bashir, and Mohamed-Slim Alouini, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will examine the **experiments or results section** of the paper, as this is typically where datasets are described in detail. I will look for any specific datasets used in the experiments, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will focus on that to gather comprehensive details about each dataset. This section often contains crucial information such as the dataset's purpose, size, and any relevant metrics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For this paper, I will look for datasets related to the lidar-assisted acquisition system, such as any experimental data collected during the study or any publicly available datasets referenced by the authors.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I adhere to proper citation formats.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ready for further processing or review.
