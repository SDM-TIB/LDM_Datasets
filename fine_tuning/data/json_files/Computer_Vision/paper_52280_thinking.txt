To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Random Access with Massive MIMO-OTFS in LEO Satellite Communications" by Boxiao Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their characteristics, size, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors refer to specific datasets when discussing their findings. This can provide additional context about the datasets and their relevance to the research outcomes.

After identifying the datasets, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For this paper, I will specifically look for any datasets related to:
1. **Channel estimation** and **device activity detection** in the context of massive MIMO-OTFS systems.
2. Any benchmarks or datasets that are commonly used in satellite communication research.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, making sure to include all relevant details for each dataset identified in the paper.
