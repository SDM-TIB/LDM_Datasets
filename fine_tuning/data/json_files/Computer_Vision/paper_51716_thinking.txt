To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning on Multimodal Sensor Data at the Wireless Edge for Vehicular Network" by Batool Salehi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted evaluations on "publicly available synthetic and home-grown real-world datasets," which suggests that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on **section VII (Dataset Description and DNN Architectures)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **RAYMOBTIME Dataset**: This dataset is described as a multimodal dataset capturing V2X deployment in an urban canyon region. It includes data collected from various sensors and is used for training and validation. The authors provide specific details about the dataset's structure and the types of data collected.

2. **NEU Dataset**: This is a home-grown dataset containing multimodal sensor observations collected in Boston. The authors provide details about the scenarios, the types of sensors used, and the number of samples collected.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their models using these datasets, which confirms their relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **RAYMOBTIME Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Klautau, A., Batista, P., Gonz√°lez-Prelcic, N., Wang, Y., & Heath, R. W. (2018). 5G MIMO Data for Machine Learning: Application to Beam-selection Using Deep Learning. In *2018 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)*, pp. 1-9.

- For the **NEU Dataset**, since it is a home-grown dataset, the authors mention that they will release it upon acceptance of the paper. Therefore, I will note that it is not yet formally cited but will be available in their public dataset repository.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
