To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Improved Single Step Non-autoregressive Transformer for Automatic Speech Recognition" by Ruchao Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors report results on the **Librispeech**, **Aishell1**, and **OGI Kids** datasets, which suggests that these are the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will move to the **introduction** section to gather more context about the datasets. The introduction mentions the performance improvements on the **Librispeech** and **Aishell1** datasets, confirming their use in the study.

Then, I will check **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Librispeech**: A 960-hour English corpus used for automatic speech recognition.
2. **Aishell1**: A 178-hour Mandarin corpus.
3. **OGI Kids**: A 50-hour English corpus designed for child speech recognition.

This section provides essential details about each dataset, including their sizes and purposes.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Librispeech**, the citation is:
  > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206–5210, 2015.

- For **Aishell1**, the citation is:
  > H. Bu, J. Du, X. Na, B. Wu, and H. Zheng. *Aishell-1: An open-source Mandarin speech corpus and a speech recognition baseline*. In 20th O-COCOSDA, pages 1–5, 2017.

- For **OGI Kids**, the citation is:
  > K. Shobaki, J.-P. Hosom, and R. A. Cole. *The OGI Kids’ Speech Corpus and Recognizers*. In Sixth International Conference on Spoken Language Processing, 2000.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any critical details and that the citations are correctly formatted for future reference.
