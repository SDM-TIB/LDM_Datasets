To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Drum Machine: An Interactive System for Real-time Synthesis of Drum Sounds" by Cyran Aouameur et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the system but does not specify datasets. The introduction discusses the context of drum sound production but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors describe the dataset they built for their study. Here, they mention that they collected over **40,000 samples across 11 drum categories**, which is a significant detail indicating the dataset's size and structure.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset:
- They mention that the dataset consists of **11 balanced categories** (kicks, claps, snares, open and closed hi-hats, tambourines, congas, bongos, shakers, snaps, and toms), with **3000 sounds each**, totaling **33,000 sounds**. 
- The sounds are **WAV audio files**, PCM-coded in 16 bits and sampled at 22050 Hz. 
- They also describe the preprocessing steps, such as removing sounds longer than 1 second and normalizing the audio files.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, the dataset described appears to be original and compiled by the authors from various sample packs, so there may not be a formal citation for it. Instead, I will note that the dataset is based on commercially available sample packs, specifically mentioning **Vengeance sample packs** as one of the sources.

Since the dataset is original and not published in a separate paper, I will summarize it as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Drum Sound Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset containing over 33,000 WAV audio files across 11 drum categories, with each category containing 3000 samples. The sounds are PCM-coded in 16 bits and sampled at 22050 Hz.
   - **Source**: Compiled from various sample packs, including Vengeance sample packs.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ensure that I have captured all necessary details, including the dataset's description and source. This will allow for proper referencing in any future work or discussions regarding the dataset.
