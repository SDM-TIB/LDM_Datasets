To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SeisFusion: Constrained Diffusion Model with Input Guidance for 3D Seismic Data Interpolation and Reconstruction" by Shuang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of missing traces in seismic data and mentions the use of both **field datasets** and **synthetic datasets** for evaluation, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In this section, they specifically mention two datasets:

1. **SEG C3 Dataset**: This is a publicly available synthetic dataset used for training and validation. The authors describe it as being divided into three parts: 3/5 for training, 1/5 for validation, and 1/5 for testing.

2. **Mobil Avo Viking Graben Line 12 Dataset**: This is a field dataset used for testing the proposed method. The authors also mention that they conducted experiments on this dataset under different missing scenarios.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the SEG C3 dataset is a publicly available synthetic dataset, it may not have a formal citation. The authors might reference it in a general sense. For the Mobil Avo Viking Graben Line 12 dataset, I will look for any specific citation or reference provided in the paper.

After reviewing the references, I will compile the information into a structured format. The citations I find will be crucial for proper attribution.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and citations, ensuring that I include all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
