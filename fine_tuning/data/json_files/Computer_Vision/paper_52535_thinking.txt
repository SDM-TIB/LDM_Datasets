To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reachability in Simple Neural Networks" by Marco SÃ¤lzer and Martin Lange, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by scanning the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In many research papers, authors will explicitly describe the datasets they used for their experiments in a specific section. I will pay close attention to any tables, figures, or descriptions that detail the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any specific configurations used in the experiments.

If the paper does not have a dedicated section, I will check the **methodology** or **results** sections, as authors sometimes discuss datasets in the context of their experimental setup or findings. I will note any datasets mentioned, including their names and any relevant details provided by the authors.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the original sources of the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "CIFAR-10," I will look for its citation in the references, which might include details such as the authors, title, conference or journal name, year of publication, and DOI if available.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation formatted correctly.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a comprehensive overview that can be used for further research or analysis.
