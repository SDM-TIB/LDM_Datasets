To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Interpretable Deep Neural Networks by Leveraging Adversarial Examples" by Hang Su et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on adversarial examples and their implications for deep neural networks, but I need to look for specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of interpretability in deep neural networks and mention that many methods have been tested on specific datasets, such as **ImageNet**. This indicates that datasets are indeed a part of their research.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe their experiments. They mention constructing a set of adversarial images based on the **ILSVRC 2012 validation set**, which is a well-known dataset used for image classification tasks. They generate 500,000 adversarial images from this dataset, which is a significant detail.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail their approach to generating adversarial examples and the datasets used for evaluation. They specifically mention the **ILSVRC 2012 dataset** as the source for their adversarial images. This dataset is crucial for understanding their experimental setup.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the datasets mentioned:

1. **ILSVRC 2012 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > O. Russakovsky, J. Deng, H. Su, J. Krause, S. Satheesh, S. Ma, Z. Huang, A. Karpathy, A. Khosla, M. Bernstein, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets identified in the paper, ensuring to include the full citations as required.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ready for further processing or review.
