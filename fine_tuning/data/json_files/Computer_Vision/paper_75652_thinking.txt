To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SMooDi: Stylized Motion Diffusion Model" by Lei Zhong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention that their experiments utilize the **HumanML3D** and **100STYLE** datasets, which indicates that these are the primary datasets of interest.

Next, I will delve into the **experiments section** to gather more details about these datasets. The authors describe the **HumanML3D dataset** as the largest motion capture dataset, featuring 14,646 motions and 44,970 motion annotations, which is crucial for understanding its significance in their work. They also mention that the **100STYLE dataset** contains up to 1,125 minutes of motion sequences showcasing a variety of locomotion styles.

I will also check the **related work and references sections** to ensure I capture the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and further exploration by readers.

The full citations I will extract are:

1. **HumanML3D Dataset**:
   > Guo, C., Zou, S., Zuo, X., Wang, S., Ji, W., Li, X., Cheng, L. (2022). *Generating diverse and natural 3D human motions from text*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2022.

2. **100STYLE Dataset**:
   > Mason, I., Starke, S., Komura, T. (2022). *Real-time style modelling of human locomotion via feature-wise transformations and local motion phases*. Proceedings of the ACM on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined along with its citation for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further study or application by others interested in this area of research.
