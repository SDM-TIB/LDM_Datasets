To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generation of Consistent Sets of Multi-Label Classification Rules with a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm" by Thiago Zafalon Miranda et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will focus on **Table I**, which is explicitly labeled as "DATASET DESCRIPTIONS." This table lists the datasets used in the experiments along with their features, classes, and instances. The datasets mentioned in this table are:

1. **CAL500**: This dataset has 68 features, 174 classes, and 502 instances.
2. **emotions**: This dataset has 72 features, 6 classes, and 593 instances.
3. **scene**: This dataset has 294 features, 6 classes, and 2407 instances.
4. **synthetic0**: This is a synthetic dataset with 10 features, 5 classes, and 10,000 instances.
5. **synthetic1**: Another synthetic dataset with 80 features, 22 classes, and 10,000 instances.
6. **synthetic2**: This synthetic dataset has 30 features, 8 classes, and 10,000 instances.
7. **synthetic3**: This dataset has 21 features, 7 classes, and 10,000 instances.
8. **yeast**: This dataset has 103 features, 14 classes, and 2417 instances.

After identifying the datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for the real-world datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **CAL500**: 
  > Turnbull, D., Barrington, L., Torres, D., & Lanckriet, G. (2008). Semantic annotation and retrieval of music and sound effects. *IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing*, 16(2), 467-476.

- **emotions**: 
  > Trohidis, K., Tsoumakas, G., Kalliris, G., & Vlahavas, I. P. (2008). Multi-label classification of music into emotions. In *ISMIR* (Vol. 8, pp. 325-330).

- **scene**: 
  > Boutell, M. R., Luo, J., Shen, X., & Brown, C. M. (2004). Learning multi-label scene classification. *Pattern Recognition*, 37(9), 1757-1771.

- **yeast**: 
  > Ueda, N., & Saito, K. (2003). Parametric mixture models for multi-labeled text. In *Advances in neural information processing systems* (pp. 737-744).

The synthetic datasets do not have specific citations as they are generated datasets based on the methodology described in the paper by Read et al. (2012), which is referenced in the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing.
