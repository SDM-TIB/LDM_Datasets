To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3D Siamese Voxel-to-BEV Tracker for Sparse Point Clouds" by Le Hui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the method is evaluated on the **KITTI** and **nuScenes** datasets, which indicates that these are the primary datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they use the **KITTI** and **nuScenes** datasets for training and evaluation. They provide details about the KITTI dataset, mentioning that it contains 21 video sequences and 8 types of objects, and that they use specific scenes for training, validation, and testing. The nuScenes dataset is mentioned as well, with a note that it only labels key frames.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and R. Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2012.

2. **nuScenes Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H. Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yu Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *nuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.11027, 2019.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **KITTI Dataset**: Used for training and evaluation, contains 21 video sequences and 8 types of objects.
- **nuScenes Dataset**: Used for evaluation, contains labeled key frames.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
