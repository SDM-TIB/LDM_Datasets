To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Music Analogy Via Latent Representation Disentanglement" by Ruihan Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on music representation and analogy-making, but it does not explicitly mention datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Methodology)**, where the authors describe their approach to disentangling music representations. Here, they mention that all data comes from the **Nottingham dataset**. This is a crucial piece of information, as it indicates the dataset used for their experiments.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors validate their method using the Nottingham dataset, confirming its significance in their research. They do not mention any additional datasets, so I will focus solely on this one.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the Nottingham dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **Nottingham Dataset**:
  > E. Foxley. *Nottingham database*, 2011.

This citation is essential for proper attribution and will be included in the dataset entry.

After gathering all necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry for the Nottingham dataset, ensuring that it includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for review or further processing.
