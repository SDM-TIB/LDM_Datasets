To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Blocked and Hierarchical Disentangled Representation From Information Theory Perspective" by Ziwen Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on several public datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The authors describe it as containing handwritten digit images with a resolution of 28 × 28 pixels, consisting of 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples.

2. **dSprites Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as containing 737,280 2D shapes generated from six independent latent factors, with images of size 64 × 64 pixels.

3. **CelebA Dataset**: The authors refer to a cropped version of this dataset, which includes 202,599 celebrity face images, each with a resolution of 64 × 64 pixels and annotated with 40 binary attributes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun. The MNIST database of handwritten digits. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, 1998.

- For the **dSprites Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Irina Higgins, Demis Hassabis, Loic Matthey, and Alexander Lerchner. dSprites: Disentanglement dataset. https://github.com/deepmind/dsprites-dataset/, 2017.

- For the **CelebA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. Deep learning face attributes in the wild. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 3730–3738, 2015.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will facilitate any further processing or review of the extracted dataset information.
