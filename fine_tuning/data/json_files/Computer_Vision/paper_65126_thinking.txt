To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Bias-Variance-Covariance Decomposition of Kernel Scores for Generative Models" by Sebastian G. Gruber and Florian Buettner, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of their framework on various generative models, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention specific datasets for image generation, audio generation, and natural language generation tasks.

1. **InfiMNIST Dataset**: This dataset is used for image generation experiments with conditional diffusion models. It is described as a synthetic dataset that generates uniquely perturbed MNIST images. The authors mention sampling 20 distinct training sets from InfiMNIST.

2. **LJSpeech Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for audio generation experiments with the Glow-TTS model. It consists of 13,100 instances of text-speech pairs, where each speech is a recording of a woman reading corresponding text.

3. **CoQA Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of their uncertainty estimation method in natural language generation tasks. It contains 7,983 test instances for conversational question answering.

4. **TriviaQA Dataset**: Another dataset for natural language generation, it includes 17,943 test instances and is used to assess the performance of their proposed methods.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **InfiMNIST**, the citation is:

- For **LJSpeech**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
