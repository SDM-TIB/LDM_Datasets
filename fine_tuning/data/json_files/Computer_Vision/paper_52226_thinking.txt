To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Novel techniques for improving NNetEn entropy calculation for short and noisy time series" by Hanif Heidari et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various applications of entropy measures and reference previous studies that may have used specific datasets. I will note any datasets mentioned here, especially those that are relevant to the experiments conducted in this paper.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using the **MNIST-10 dataset** as input for the LogNNet model. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed entropy measure.

In the **results section**, I will look for any additional datasets used in their experiments, especially in relation to the real-time EEG data collected for emotion recognition tasks. The authors mention collecting EEG data from 14 healthy subjects, which is significant for the study.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **MNIST-10 Dataset**: 
   > Deng, L. (2012). The MNIST database of handwritten digit images for machine learning research. *IEEE Signal Processing Magazine*, 29(6), 141-142. https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2012.2211477

2. **EEG Data**: The authors reference their own previous work for the EEG data collection, which is not explicitly cited in the references but is mentioned in the context of emotion recognition. I will note that the EEG data was collected from 14 healthy subjects for detecting six basic emotions, but I will need to refer to the original source for a complete citation if available.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the details of each dataset, including their significance to the research, and prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing.
