To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gradient-based Data Augmentation for Semi-Supervised Learning" by Hiroshi Kaizuka, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors discuss evaluating their method on **three standard benchmark datasets**: SVHN, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for specific sections that describe the datasets in detail. The **experiments section** is crucial, as it typically contains information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors provide descriptions of the datasets:

1. **SVHN (Street View House Numbers)**: This dataset consists of close-up images of house numbers, with each image labeled with a digit from 0 to 9. The training set contains 73,257 images, while the test set has 26,032 images.

2. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

3. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images, but it is divided into 100 classes, with 500 training images and 100 test images per class.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Y. Netzer, T. Wang, A. Coates, A. Bissacco, B. Wu, and A. Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. In NIPS, 2011.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > A. Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > A. Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
