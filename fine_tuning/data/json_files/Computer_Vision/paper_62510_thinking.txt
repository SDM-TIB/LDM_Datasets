To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Geometric Autoencoders – What You See is What You Decode" by Philipp Nazari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention using several datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition.
2. **FashionMNIST Dataset**: A dataset of clothing items, serving as a more challenging alternative to MNIST.
3. **Zilionis Dataset**: A single-cell transcriptomics dataset.
4. **PBMC Dataset**: Another single-cell dataset, specifically from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
5. **CElegans Dataset**: A dataset related to the model organism C. elegans.
6. **Earth Dataset**: A synthetic dataset created by sampling points from the unit sphere to represent landmasses on Earth.

After identifying these datasets, I will look for their full citations in the **References section** of the paper. The citations I find are:

- **MNIST Dataset**:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition*. IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- **FashionMNIST Dataset**:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: a Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

- **Zilionis Dataset**:
  > R. Zilionis, C. Engblom, P. Christina, et al. *Single-Cell Transcriptomics of Human and Mouse Lung Cancers Reveals Conserved Myeloid Populations across Individuals and Species*. Immunity, 50(5):1317–1334, 2019.

- **PBMC Dataset**:
  > G. X. Zheng, J. M. Terry, P. Belgrader, et al. *Massively Parallel Digital Transcriptional Profiling of Single Cells*. Nature Communications, 8(1):1–12, 2017.

- **CElegans Dataset**:
  > J. S. Packer, Q. Zhu, C. Huynh, et al. *A Lineage-Resolved Molecular Atlas of C. elegans Embryogenesis at Single-Cell Resolution*. Science, 365(6459):eaax1971, 2019.

- **Earth Dataset**: This dataset is synthetic and does not have a formal citation, but it is described in the paper as being generated from points sampled from the unit sphere.

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
