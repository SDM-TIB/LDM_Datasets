To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust GPS-Vision Localization via Integrity-Driven Landmark Attention" by Sriramya Bhamidipati and Grace Xingxin Gao, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of an urban dataset for demonstrating improved localization accuracy, which indicates that a dataset is involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation. In this section, they mention using an "urban sequence from a monocular visual odometry dataset" and provide details about how they adapted this dataset for their experiments. This is a strong indication that the dataset is significant for their research.

I will also look for any **figures or tables** that might provide additional context or details about the datasets used. Figures often summarize experimental setups or results that can include dataset information.

After identifying the dataset, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors may cite the original source of the dataset, which is crucial for proper attribution.

In this case, the paper specifically mentions using the following dataset:

1. **Monocular Visual Odometry Dataset**: The authors refer to a specific dataset for their experiments, which is identified as:
   > Engel, J., Usenko, V., & Cremers, D. (2016). *A photometrically calibrated benchmark for monocular visual odometry*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1607.02555.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.

By following this methodical approach, I ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper along with their proper citations.
