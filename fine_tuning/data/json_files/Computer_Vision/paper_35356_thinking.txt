To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Retinal Vessel Segmentation Based on Conditional Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks" by Jiang Yun and Tan Ning, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validated their method on the **DRIVE** and **STARE** datasets, which suggests these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** where the authors discuss their methodology and results. In this section, they explicitly mention using the **DRIVE** and **STARE** datasets for their experiments, confirming their relevance to the study.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any part of the paper that provides detailed descriptions of these datasets. The authors mention that the DRIVE dataset consists of 40 retinal images and the STARE dataset is also referenced, but I need to ensure I capture the specifics about each dataset, such as the number of images and any relevant characteristics.

After gathering the necessary information about the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for both datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For the **DRIVE dataset**:
  > Staal, J. J., Abramoff, M. D., Niemeijer, M., Viergever, M. A., & van Ginneken, B. (2004). Ridge based vessel segmentation in color images of the retina. *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 23(4), 501-509.

- For the **STARE dataset**:
  > Marin, D., et al. (2011). A new supervised method for blood vessel segmentation in retinal images by using gray-level and moment invariants-based features. *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 30(1), 146-158.

Now that I have the dataset names and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
