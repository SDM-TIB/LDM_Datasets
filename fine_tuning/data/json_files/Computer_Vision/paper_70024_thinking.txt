To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Confident Steps to New Pockets: Strategies for Docking Generalization" by Gabriele Corso et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces **DOCKGEN**, a new benchmark for assessing docking methods, which suggests that this is a key dataset to note.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (The DOCKGEN Benchmark)**, where the authors describe the creation of the DOCKGEN dataset. They mention that DOCKGEN is based on the ligand-binding domains of proteins and includes a validation set of 141 unique complexes and a test set of 189 complexes. This section provides essential details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

In addition, I will look for any other datasets referenced in the paper. The authors mention the **PDBBind dataset** as a previously used benchmark for training and testing docking models. They describe how PDBBind is a curated set of protein-ligand crystallographic structures, which is crucial for understanding the context of their work.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for both datasets:

1. **DOCKGEN**: Since this is a new benchmark introduced in the paper, I will cite it as follows:
   > Corso, G., Deng, A., Fry, B., Polizzi, N., Barzilay, R., & Jaakkola, T. (2024). Deep Confident Steps to New Pockets: Strategies for Docking Generalization. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

2. **PDBBind**: The citation for the PDBBind dataset is:
   > Liu, Z., Su, M., Han, L., Liu, J., Yang, Q., Li, Y., & Wang, R. (2017). Forging the basis for developing proteinâ€“ligand interaction scoring functions. Accounts of Chemical Research, 50, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
