To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ASDF: Assembly State Detection Utilizing Late Fusion by Integrating 6D Pose Estimation" by Hannah Schieber et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on the **ASDF dataset** and the **GBOT dataset**, which suggests that these are key datasets for their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **methodology section**. In section 3.2, the authors describe the **ASDF dataset**, which is a synthetic dataset created using 3D printable parts. It includes ground truth annotations for 6D object poses and assembly states. The dataset is generated using BlenderProc and incorporates various domain randomization techniques. This section provides a clear understanding of the dataset's purpose and structure.

The authors also mention the **GBOT dataset** in section 4.3, describing it as a synthetic dataset designed for 6D object pose and tracking tasks. It comprises 3D printable assembly parts and includes evaluation sequences with varying difficulty levels. This information confirms that both datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **ASDF dataset**, the citation is:
  > Schieber, H., Li, S., Corell, N., Beckerle, P., Kreimeier, J., & Roth, D. (2024). ASDF: Assembly State Detection Utilizing Late Fusion by Integrating 6D Pose Estimation. *Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)*.

- For the **GBOT dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li, S., Schieber, H., Corell, N., Egger, B., Kreimeier, J., & Roth, D. (2024). GBOT: Graph-Based 3D Object Tracking for Augmented Reality-Assisted Assembly Guidance. *Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)*.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

1. **ASDF Dataset**: A synthetic dataset created using 3D printable parts, providing ground truth annotations for 6D object poses and assembly states. It utilizes domain randomization techniques for robustness.

2. **GBOT Dataset**: A synthetic dataset designed for 6D object pose and tracking tasks, featuring 3D printable assembly parts and evaluation sequences with varying difficulty levels.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
