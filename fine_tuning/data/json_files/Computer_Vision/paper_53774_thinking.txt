To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prompt-based Learning for Unpaired Image Captioning" by Peipei Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on the **COCO** and **Flickr30K** datasets, which indicates that these are key datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **COCO Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 123,287 images, with a specific split for training, validation, and testing. The authors note that it is a popular benchmark for image captioning tasks.

2. **Flickr30K Dataset**: This dataset consists of 31,783 images, also with a defined split for training, validation, and testing.

Additionally, the authors refer to other datasets used for language, including **Shutterstock sentences** and **Conceptual sentences**, which are used in conjunction with the image datasets for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **COCO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, Springer, 2014, pp. 740–755.

- For the **Flickr30K Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Lu, C. Xiong, D. Parikh, R. Socher. *Knowing When to Look: Adaptive Attention via a Visual Sentinel for Image Captioning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2017, pp. 375–383.

- For the **Shutterstock sentences**, the citation is:
  > Y. Feng, L. Ma, W. Liu, J. Luo. *Unsupervised Image Captioning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2019, pp. 4125–4134.

- For the **Conceptual sentences**, the citation is:
  > P. Sharma, N. Ding, S. Goodman, R. Soricut. *Conceptual Captions: A Cleaned, Hypernymed, Image Alt-Text Dataset for Automatic Image Captioning*. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), 2018, pp. 2556–2565.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
