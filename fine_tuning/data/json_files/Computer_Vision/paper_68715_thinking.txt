To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ICON: Incremental CONfidence for Joint Pose and Radiance Field Optimization" by Weiyao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on datasets such as **CO3D**, **HO3D**, and **LLFF**, which suggests that these are key datasets used in their research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, they mention:

1. **CO3D Dataset**: This is described as a large-scale dataset consisting of turn-table style videos of objects, with ground truth poses obtained through COLMAP. The authors specify that they use both the full-scene and object-only versions of this dataset.

2. **HO3D Dataset**: This dataset is repurposed for evaluating camera pose tracking and view synthesis quality. It consists of static camera RGBD videos capturing dynamic objects manipulated by human hands.

3. **LLFF Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for scene-level novel view synthesis and is mentioned as a benchmark for evaluating their method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CO3D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Reizenstein, J., Shapovalov, R., Henzler, P., Sbordone, L., Labatut, P., & Novotny, D. (2021). Common objects in 3D: Large-scale learning and evaluation of real-life 3D category reconstruction. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

- For **HO3D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hampali, S., Rad, M., Oberweger, M., & Lepetit, V. (2020). Honnotate: A method for 3D annotation of hand and object poses. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For **LLFF Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mildenhall, B., Srinivasan, P. P., Tancik, M., Barron, J. T., Ramamoorthi, R., & Ng, R. (2019). Local light field fusion: Practical view synthesis with prescriptive sampling guidelines. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 38(4), 1-14.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or processing.
