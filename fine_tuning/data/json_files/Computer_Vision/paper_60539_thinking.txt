To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CoDi: Co-evolving Contrastive Diffusion Models for Mixed-type Tabular Synthesis" by Chaejeong Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments with **11 real-world tabular datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention the datasets in **section 4.1.1 (Datasets & Baselines)**, where they explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Bank Dataset**: Used to predict whether a client subscribed to a term deposit. The dataset contains personal financial situations.
