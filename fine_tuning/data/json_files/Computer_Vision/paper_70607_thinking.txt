To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalized Predictive Model for Autonomous Driving" by Jiazhi Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets. The abstract mentions the introduction of a large-scale video dataset called **OpenDV-2K**, which is a strong indicator that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (OpenDV-2K Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they describe **OpenDV-2K** as a large-scale multimodal dataset for autonomous driving, containing over 2000 hours of driving videos collected from YouTube and other public datasets. They also mention the dataset's diversity in terms of geographic locations, weather conditions, and driving scenarios.

In **Table 1**, the authors compare OpenDV-2K with other existing datasets, which include:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: A well-known dataset for autonomous driving research, containing various driving scenarios.
   - Citation: 
     > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, Christoph Stiller, and Raquel Urtasun. *Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset*. IJRR, 2013.

2. **Cityscapes Dataset**: Focused on semantic urban scene understanding.
   - Citation: 
     > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The Cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In CVPR, 2016.

3. **Waymo Open Dataset**: A large dataset for autonomous driving perception.
   - Citation: 
     > Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H. Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yuxin Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *nuScenes: A multi-modal dataset for autonomous driving*. In CVPR, 2020.

4. **nuScenes Dataset**: Another comprehensive dataset for autonomous driving.
   - Citation: 
     > Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H. Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yuxin Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *nuScenes: A multi-modal dataset for autonomous driving*. In CVPR, 2020.

5. **Honda-HAD Dataset**: A dataset for learning driver behavior and causal reasoning.
   - Citation: 
     > Vasili Ramanishka, Yi-Ting Chen, Teruhisa Misu, and Kate Saenko. *Toward driving scene understanding: A dataset for learning driver behavior and causal reasoning*. In CVPR, 2018.

6. **Honda-HDD-Action Dataset**: Contains labeled actions for driving scenarios.
   - Citation: 
     > Vasili Ramanishka, Yi-Ting Chen, Teruhisa Misu, and Kate Saenko. *Toward driving scene understanding: A dataset for learning driver behavior and causal reasoning*. In CVPR, 2018.

7. **Honda-HDD-Cause Dataset**: Provides causal explanations for driving behaviors.
   - Citation: 
     > Vasili Ramanishka, Yi-Ting Chen, Teruhisa Misu, and Kate Saenko. *Toward driving scene understanding: A dataset for learning driver behavior and causal reasoning*. In CVPR, 2018.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their full citations as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation for future reference or analysis.
