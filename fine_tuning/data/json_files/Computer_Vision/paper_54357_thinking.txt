To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning the Evolutionary and Multi-scale Graph Structure for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting" by Junchen Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions experiments on "six popular real-world datasets," which indicates that multiple datasets are used, prompting me to look for their names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets & Setup)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **Solar-Energy Dataset**: This dataset contains solar power production records from 137 PV plants in Alabama State in 2007. It is sourced from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

2. **Electricity Dataset**: This dataset includes hourly electricity consumption data from 321 clients from 2012 to 2014, also published by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

3. **Exchange Rate Dataset**: This dataset consists of daily exchange rates of eight countries from 1990 to 2016, sourced from the same publication.

4. **Wind Dataset**: This dataset contains hourly energy potential estimates from 1986 to 2015.

5. **NYC-Bike Dataset**: This dataset collects daily bike-sharing demand data from 250 bike stations in New York from April 1, 2016, to June 30, 2016.

6. **NYC-Taxi Dataset**: This dataset includes taxi demand data in New York for the same period as the NYC-Bike dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Solar-Energy Dataset**:
  > National Renewable Energy Laboratory. *Solar Power Production Records*. 2007.

- For the **Electricity Dataset**:
  > National Renewable Energy Laboratory. *Hourly Electricity Consumption Data*. 2012-2014.

- For the **Exchange Rate Dataset**:
  > National Renewable Energy Laboratory. *Daily Exchange Rates of Eight Countries*. 1990-2016.

- For the **Wind Dataset**:
  > National Renewable Energy Laboratory. *Hourly Energy Potential Estimates*. 1986-2015.

- For the **NYC-Bike Dataset**:
  > NYC OpenData. *NYC Bike Sharing Demand Data*. April 1, 2016 - June 30, 2016.

- For the **NYC-Taxi Dataset**:
  > NYC OpenData. *NYC Taxi Demand Data*. April 1, 2016 - June 30, 2016.

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
