To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Federated Stain Normalization for Computational Pathology" by Nicolas Wagner et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the construction of a **heterogenic multi-institutional dataset based on the PESO segmentation dataset**, which indicates that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation)**, where the authors explicitly discuss the dataset used for their experiments. They mention the **PESO dataset**, which comprises 102 hematoxylin and eosin stained whole slide images (WSI) and corresponding segmentation masks. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's contents and its relevance to the study.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the PESO dataset, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citation for the PESO dataset is as follows:
> Bulten, W., Bandi, P., Hoven, J., van de Loo, R., Lotz, J., Weiss, N., van der Laak, J., van Ginneken, B., Hulsbergen-van de Kaa, C., Litjens, G. (2019). *Epithelium segmentation using deep learning in h&e-stained prostate specimens with immunohistochemistry as reference standard*. Scientific Reports, 9(1), 1-10.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the evaluation section for explicit dataset details.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references section.

This methodical approach ensures that I accurately capture the necessary information regarding datasets used in the research paper.
