To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Coupled Variational Autoencoder" by Xiaoran Hao and Patrick Shafto, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on experiments or datasets**. In many research papers, authors will explicitly list the datasets they used for their experiments in a specific section. I will pay close attention to any tables, figures, or descriptions that detail the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant splits (e.g., training/test).

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets in the **experiments section** (section 5). The authors may describe the datasets used for testing the Coupled Variational Autoencoder (C-VAE) model, including any synthetic datasets or real-world datasets like MNIST.

Once I identify the datasets, I will then check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation allows others to locate the datasets used in the research. I will ensure to note down the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset**, I will look for its citation, which typically includes:
- The authors of the original MNIST dataset paper.
- The title of the paper.
- The conference or journal where it was published.
- The year of publication.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their descriptions and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified and properly referenced.

Finally, I will format the extracted information in a structured manner, ready for further processing or review, while ensuring that the citations are complete and accurate.
