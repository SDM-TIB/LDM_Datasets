To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AttenCraft: Attention-guided Disentanglement of Multiple Concepts for Text-to-Image Customization" by Junjie Shentu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors perform experiments on "fifteen datasets spanning various categories," which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant subsections that might provide detailed descriptions. In this case, the **Experiments section (4.1)** explicitly states that the authors perform experiments on fifteen datasets, including ten datasets collected from DisenDiff and five synthesized datasets using Gen4Gen.

I will note the specific datasets mentioned in this section:

1. **DisenDiff Datasets**: The paper does not provide specific names for these datasets, but it indicates that they are characterized by relatively simple backgrounds.

2. **Gen4Gen Datasets**: The authors synthesized five datasets using this method, which combines multiple personalized concepts into complex backgrounds. The concepts for synthesis are curated from the DreamBooth dataset and CustomConcept101.

The paper lists the class names for each dataset in **Appendix A.2**, which includes:
- cat & dog
- baby & toy
- chair & lamp
- chair & vase
- dog & pig
- horse & dog
- woman & dog
- cow & bird
- man & woman
- woman & boy
- boot & backpack
- cat & penguin
- dog & bear
- backpack & toy
- toy & vase

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the following datasets:

- **DreamBooth Dataset**: 
  > Nataniel Ruiz, Yuanzhen Li, Varun Jampani, Yael Pritch, Michael Rubinstein, and Kfir Aberman. *Dreambooth: Fine tuning text-to-image diffusion models for subject-driven generation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 22500–22510, 2023.

- **CustomConcept101**: 
  > Nupur Kumari, Bingliang Zhang, Richard Zhang, Eli Shechtman, and Jun-Yan Zhu. *Multi-concept customization of text-to-image diffusion*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 1931–1941, 2023.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that I have captured the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and the full citations accurately.
