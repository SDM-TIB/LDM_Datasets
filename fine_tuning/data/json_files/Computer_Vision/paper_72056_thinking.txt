To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Schrödinger Bridge Matching for Pansharpening" by Zihan Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three commonly used pansharpening datasets. This indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used in the **Experiments** section, specifically in subsection 5.3 titled "Datasets." Here, they describe the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **WorldView-3 (WV3)**: This dataset contains 9714 training samples and 1080 validation samples, with each sample consisting of a PAN (panchromatic), LRMS (low-resolution multispectral), and GT (ground truth) image pair. The sizes of these images are 64 × 64 × 1 for PAN, 16 × 16 × 8 for LRMS, and 64 × 64 × 8 for GT.

2. **GaoFen-2 (GF2)**: This dataset includes 19809 training samples and 2201 validation samples, with similar structure to the WV3 dataset. The sizes for this dataset are 64 × 64 × 1 for PAN, 16 × 16 × 4 for LRMS, and 64 × 64 × 4 for GT.

3. **GF5-GF1 Dataset**: This dataset is used for hyperspectral real remote sensing data, containing HSIs (hyperspectral images) and MSIs (multispectral images). The spatial sizes of HSIs are 1161 × 1120 × 150 and MSIs are 2332 × 2258 × 4.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **WorldView-3**, the citation is:
  > DigitalGlobe. *WorldView-3 Satellite Imagery*. [Online]. Available: https://www.digitalglobe.com/

- For **GaoFen-2**, the citation is:
  > China Center for Resources Satellite Data and Application. *GaoFen-2 Satellite Imagery*. [Online]. Available: http://www.cresda.com/

- For **GF5-GF1**, the citation is:
  > China Center for Resources Satellite Data and Application. *GF5-GF1 Dataset*. [Online]. Available: http://www.cresda.com/

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
