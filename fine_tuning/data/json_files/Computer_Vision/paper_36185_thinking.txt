To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantifying the Effects of Enforcing Disentanglement on Variational Autoencoders" by Momchil Peychev et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the concept of disentangled autoencoders but do not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the **experiments section**.

In **section 3.1.1 (Data)**, the authors describe a **synthetic dataset** they constructed, which consists of 267,021 images of single shapes (square, ellipse, triangle) with various attributes (position, scale, rotation). This dataset is crucial for their experiments, so I will document it.

Additionally, in **section 3.2 (MNIST classification with disentangled autoencoders)**, the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset** for evaluating their model's performance. This is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, and I will include it as well.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **synthetic dataset**, since it is constructed by the authors, I will note that it does not have a formal citation but will describe it in detail.

2. For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, Nov 1998.

Now, I will summarize the datasets I found:

- **Synthetic Dataset**: A dataset of 267,021 binarized images containing single shapes (square, ellipse, triangle) with various attributes. This dataset was created by the authors for their experiments.

- **MNIST Dataset**: A widely used dataset for handwritten digit classification, consisting of 70,000 images of handwritten digits.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the necessary details and citations for each dataset as required.
