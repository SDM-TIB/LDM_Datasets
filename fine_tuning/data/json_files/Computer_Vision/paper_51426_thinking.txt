To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GPU optimization of the 3D Scale-invariant Feature Transform Algorithm and a Novel BRIEF-inspired 3D Fast Descriptor" by Jean-Baptiste Carluera et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of "3D MRI human brain volumes of different people," indicating that there may be specific datasets referenced.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials & Methods section**, particularly subsection 3.3, where the authors discuss the experiments conducted. Here, they mention using the **OASIS dataset** for their experiments, which is an open-access database of T1-weighted MRI volumes of the human brain.

In this section, they provide demographic and statistical information about the OASIS dataset, including the number of subjects, gender distribution, age range, available volumes, voxel size, and average keypoints per volume. This detailed description confirms that the OASIS dataset is indeed the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the OASIS dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **OASIS dataset**: 
  > Marcus, D. S., Wang, T. H., Parker, J., Csernansky, J. G., Morris, J. C., & Buckner, R. L. (2007). Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS): cross-sectional MRI data in young, middle aged, nondemented, and demented older adults. *Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience*, 19(9), 1498-1507.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the OASIS dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for review or further processing.
