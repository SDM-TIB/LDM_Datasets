To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ODBAE: a high-performance model identifying complex phenotypes in high-dimensional biological datasets" by Yafei Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, results, and methods sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of data from the **International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC)**, which indicates that this is a significant dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **results section**. The authors describe how they applied ODBAE to both developmental and metabolism-related datasets from IMPC. This suggests that there are at least two distinct datasets involved.

In the **methods section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used. They mention that the developmental dataset was integrated from eight phenotyping centers and the metabolism-related dataset was from eleven phenotyping centers. This gives me a clearer picture of the datasets' origins.

Now, I will compile the specific datasets mentioned:

1. **Developmental Dataset**: This dataset is integrated from eight phenotyping centers, which include BCM, HMGU, ICS, JAX, MRC Harwell, RBRC, TCP, and UC Davis. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset, so I will note it as a general dataset from IMPC.

2. **Metabolism-related Dataset**: This dataset is derived from eleven phenotyping centers, including BCM, CCP-IMG, HMGU, ICS, KMPC, MARC, MRC Harwell, RBRC, TCP, UC Davis, and WTSI. Similar to the developmental dataset, this dataset does not have a specific citation provided in the paper.

Next, I will check the **data availability section** for any links or references to where these datasets can be accessed. The authors mention that the raw data from IMPC can be downloaded from a specific URL, which I will include in the citation for the IMPC datasets.

Finally, I will ensure that I format the citations correctly. The citations for the datasets will be as follows:

- For the **Developmental Dataset**:
  > International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC). *Developmental dataset integrated from multiple phenotyping centers*. Available at: https://www.mousephenotype.org/about-impc/arrive-guidelines.

- For the **Metabolism-related Dataset**:
  > International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC). *Metabolism-related dataset integrated from multiple phenotyping centers*. Available at: https://www.mousephenotype.org/about-impc/arrive-guidelines.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have captured all necessary details for future reference or analysis.
