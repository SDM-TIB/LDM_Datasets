To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Learning of Interpretable Dialog Models" by Dhiraj Madan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a general overview, but the experimental setup is likely to contain specific details about the datasets used.

In the **experimental setup section (Section 3)**, the authors explicitly mention that they perform experiments on four dialog datasets: **Stanford Multi-Domain Dataset (SMD)**, **CamRest**, **DSTC6**, and **Car Assistant Dialog Dataset (CADD)**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look for any additional details about these datasets in the same section. The authors provide some context about how the datasets were collected and processed. For instance, they mention that **CamRest** and **SMD** were collected through Amazon Mechanical Turk using a Wizard-of-Oz framework, and that the **DSTC6** dataset is a corpus of (context, response) pairs that were filtered to create complete dialogs.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. **Stanford Multi-Domain Dataset (SMD)**:
   - Citation: Eric, M., Krishnan, L., Charette, F., & Manning, C. D. (2017). Key-value retrieval networks for task-oriented dialogue. In Proceedings of the 18th Annual SIGdial Meeting on Discourse and Dialogue, Saarbrücken, Germany, August 15-17, 2017, 37–49.

2. **CamRest**:
   - Citation: Wen, T.-H., Gasic, M., Mrkšić, N., Rojas Barahona, L. M., Su, P.-H., Ultes, S., & Young, S. (2016). Conditional generation and snapshot learning in neural dialogue systems. In EMNLP, 2153–2162. Austin, Texas: ACL.

3. **DSTC6**:
   - Citation: Boureau, Y.-L., Bordes, A., & Perez, J. (2017). Dialog state tracking challenge 6. In The 6th Dialog System Technology Challenge. Long Beach, USA: ISCA.

4. **Car Assistant Dialog Dataset (CADD)**:
   - Citation: (Note: The paper does not provide a specific citation for CADD, but it mentions that it consists of 986 conversations between an in-house car assistant bot and its users. If this dataset is publicly available, I would need to look for its citation elsewhere.)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
