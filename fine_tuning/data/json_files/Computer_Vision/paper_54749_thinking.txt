To extract datasets from the research paper titled "COBRA: Cpu-Only aBdominal oRgan segmentAtion" by Edward G. A. Henderson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a method for abdominal organ segmentation, which suggests that datasets related to abdominal CT scans may be involved. The introduction further emphasizes the need for large and diverse datasets for training segmentation models, indicating that specific datasets might be referenced.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **results** sections. In this paper, there is a section titled **3. Dataset and Evaluation Metrics**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used.

In this section, the authors mention that the dataset used for FLARE2021 is adapted from several sources, including:

1. **MSD (Medical Segmentation Decathlon)**: This dataset includes various organ segmentation tasks.
2. **NIH Pancreas Dataset**: A dataset specifically for pancreas segmentation.
3. **KiTS (Kidney Tumor Segmentation Challenge)**: A dataset focused on kidney tumor segmentation.
4. **Nanjing University Dataset**: Another dataset used for abdominal organ segmentation.

The paper states that the total number of cases is 511, with a specific split for training, validation, and testing. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and usage.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **MSD**, the citation is:

- For **NIH Pancreas Dataset**, the citation is:

- For **KiTS**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
