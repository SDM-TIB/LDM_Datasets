To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Advancing Fine-Grained Classification by Structure and Subject Preserving Augmentation" by Eyal Michaeli and Ohad Fried, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the need for effective data augmentation in fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) due to the challenges posed by small and less diverse datasets. This suggests that the authors likely reference specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology** and **experiments** sections. In the **method** section, the authors describe their approach and may reference datasets used for training and evaluation. I will pay particular attention to any sections that discuss experimental setups or dataset descriptions.

Upon reviewing the **experiments** section, I find that the authors evaluate their method on five FGVC datasets:

1. **Aircraft Dataset**: This dataset is referenced multiple times, indicating its significance in the experiments.
2. **Stanford Cars Dataset**: Another key dataset mentioned for evaluating the proposed method.
3. **CUB Dataset**: This dataset is also included in the experiments, focusing on fine-grained classification tasks.
4. **DTD Dataset**: The authors mention this dataset, which is known for its texture classification.
5. **CompCars Dataset**: This dataset is included as part of the evaluation to assess the performance of the proposed method.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help ensure that all relevant datasets are documented comprehensively and correctly.
