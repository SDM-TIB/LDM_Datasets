To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GP+: A Python Library for Kernel-based learning via Gaussian Processes" by Amin Yousefpour et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions that GP+ is accompanied by a rich set of datasets from engineering applications, which suggests that there are specific datasets that will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that discuss the datasets used for validation and testing. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and the context in which they are used.

In the **background or related works sections**, the authors may reference existing datasets or benchmarks that are relevant to their work. I will note any datasets mentioned here as they may provide context or comparisons for the datasets used in their own experiments.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if I find that the authors used the "Penn Action Dataset" and "sub-JHMDB Dataset," I will look for their full citations in the references. The citation format typically includes the authors, title, conference or journal name, and publication year.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and characteristics.
3. The full citation for the dataset as found in the references.

Finally, I will ensure that the information is organized clearly and accurately, ready for any further processing or presentation.
