To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FDVTSâ€™s Solution for 2nd COV19D Competition on COVID-19 Detection and Severity Analysis" by Junlin Hou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in a COVID-19 competition, which suggests that they likely used specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they utilized. Here, they mention the **COV19-CT-DB**, which is described as containing 3D chest CT scans annotated for COVID-19. The section provides specifics about the number of scans, the distribution between COVID and non-COVID cases, and the breakdown of training, validation, and testing sets.

The dataset details are as follows:
- **COV19-CT-DB**: This dataset includes 1,650 COVID-19 and 6,100 non-COVID chest CT scan series, totaling 724,273 slices for COVID-19 and 1,775,727 slices for non-COVID-19. The dataset is split into training (1,992 scans), validation (494 scans), and a further split for severity classification.

After identifying the dataset, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the COV19-CT-DB dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:
- For **COV19-CT-DB**, the citation is:
  > Kollias, D., Arsenos, A., Kollias, S. "AI-MIA: COVID-19 Detection & Severity Analysis through Medical Imaging." arXiv preprint arXiv:2206.04732 (2022).

Now that I have the dataset name and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset details along with the full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is ready for review or further processing, maintaining clarity and accuracy in the representation of the dataset information.
