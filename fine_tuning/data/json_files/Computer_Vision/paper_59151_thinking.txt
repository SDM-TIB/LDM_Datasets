To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3D Equivariant Diffusion for Target-Aware Molecule Generation and Affinity Prediction" by Jiaqi Guan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset called **CrossDocked2020** for evaluating the proposed model, which indicates that this is a key dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss various generative models and their limitations, but they primarily focus on the methodology rather than listing datasets. However, they do reference the **CrossDocked2020** dataset again, confirming its importance.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to the setup and data subsections. Here, the authors detail their use of the **CrossDocked2020** dataset, describing how they refined the dataset to include 100,000 complexes for training and 100 novel complexes for testing. This section provides essential details about the dataset's composition and its relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **CrossDocked2020** dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Francoeur, P. G., Masuda, T., Sunseri, J., Jia, A., Iovanisci, R. B., Snyder, I., & Koes, D. R. (2020). Three-dimensional convolutional neural networks and a cross-docked data set for structure-based drug design. *Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling*, 60(9), 4200-4215.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information regarding the dataset into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for any further processing or review.
