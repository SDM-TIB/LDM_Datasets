To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3DTextureTransformer: Geometry Aware Texture Generation for Arbitrary Mesh Topology" by Dharma KC and Clayton T. Morrison, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses generating textures for 3D meshes, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will look for more detailed information in the subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the importance of texture generation for 3D meshes but do not provide specific dataset names. I will continue to the **methodology** section to see if any datasets are referenced there.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors state that they experimented with the **Chairs and Cars dataset**. This dataset is described as using a collection of 3D geometry from **ShapeNet** and a collection of 2D real-world images of chairs and cars. This is a crucial finding, as it indicates the datasets used for their experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **ShapeNet dataset**, the citation is:
   > A. X. Chang, T. Funkhouser, L. Guibas, P. Hanrahan, Q. Huang, Z. Li, S. Savarese, M. Savva, S. Song, H. Su, et al. *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

2. For the **Chairs and Cars dataset**, since it is derived from ShapeNet and includes real-world images, I will cite it as follows:
   > Y. Siddiqui, J. Thies, F. Ma, Q. Shan, M. Nießner, and A. Dai. *Texturify: Generating textures on 3D shape surfaces*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 72–88. Springer, 2022.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation, which is essential for proper attribution in any subsequent work.
