To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Epidemiology by Doing: The Empirical Implications of a Spatial-SIR Model with Behavioral Responses" by Alberto Bisin and Andrea Moro, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses simulating a spatial behavioral model of infection diffusion, which suggests that there may be datasets related to infection rates, geographic characteristics, and population dynamics.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section** where the authors describe their simulations and calibrations. Here, they mention using panel data from various geographical units to derive implications for estimating the effects of the epidemic and policy interventions. This indicates that there are specific datasets used for their analysis.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources. The authors may refer to specific datasets used for calibration or validation of their model, especially in the context of the simulations they conducted.

In the **references section**, I will look for any cited datasets or studies that provide data relevant to their research. This may include datasets from previous studies on COVID-19 or other epidemiological models.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to extract the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. For example, if they refer to a specific dataset like the "COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University," I will note the full citation as follows:

- **COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University**: 
  > Dong, E., Du, H., & Gardner, L. (2020). An interactive web-based dashboard to track COVID-19 in real time. *The Lancet Infectious Diseases*, 20(5), 533-534.

After gathering all relevant datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that each dataset is accurately described with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the data sources used in the research paper.
