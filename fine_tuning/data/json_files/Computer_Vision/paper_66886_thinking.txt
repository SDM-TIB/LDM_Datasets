To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GeoDream: Disentangling 2D and Geometric Priors for High-Fidelity and Consistent 3D Generation" by Baorui Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the incorporation of 3D priors and mentions the use of large-scale 3D datasets, which suggests that specific datasets may be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **related work and experiments sections**. In the related work, the authors mention two significant datasets: **Objaverse** and **Objaverse-XL**. These datasets are crucial as they are used for training and fine-tuning the models discussed in the paper.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail how they utilize these datasets for their evaluations. They specifically mention that they leverage multi-view images rendered from these datasets to enhance their model's performance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **Objaverse**:
   > Deitke, M., Schwenk, D., Salvador, J., Weihs, L., Michel, O., VanderBilt, E., Schmidt, L., Ehsani, K., Kembhavi, A., & Farhadi, A. (2023). Objaverse: A universe of annotated 3D objects. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 13142â€“13153.

2. **Objaverse-XL**:
   > Deitke, M., Liu, R., Wallingford, M., Ngo, H., Michel, O., Kusupati, A., Fan, A., Laforte, C., Voleti, V., & Gadre, S. Y. (2023). Objaverse-xl: A universe of 10m+ 3D objects. arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.05663.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.
