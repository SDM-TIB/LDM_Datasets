To extract datasets from the research paper titled "S3TC: Spiking Separated Spatial and Temporal Convolutions with Unsupervised STDP-based Learning for Action Recognition" by Mireille El-Assal et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their method on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section V (Evaluation)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They list three datasets: 

1. **KTH Dataset**: This dataset consists of 600 videos featuring 25 subjects performing 6 actions across 4 scenarios. The authors specify the training, validation, and testing splits based on the KTH protocol.

2. **Weizmann Dataset**: This dataset contains 90 videos of 9 subjects performing 10 actions. The authors mention that they use a leave-one-subject-out strategy for their experiments.

3. **IXMAS Dataset**: This dataset includes 10 subjects performing 11 actions across 1148 sequences. Similar to the Weizmann dataset, the leave-one-subject-out strategy is employed for evaluation.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **KTH Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Christian Schuldt, Ivan Laptev, and Barbara Caputo. *Recognizing Human Actions: A Local SVM Approach*. In Proceedings of the Pattern Recognition, 17th International Conference on (ICPR’04) Volume 3 - Volume 03, ICPR ’04, page 32–36, USA, 2004. IEEE Computer Society.

- For the **Weizmann Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lena Gorelick, Moshe Blank, Eli Shechtman, Michal Irani, and Ronen Basri. *Actions as space-time shapes*. Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 29(12):2247–2253, December 2007.

- For the **IXMAS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Daniel Weinland, R´emi Ronfard, and Edmond Boyer. *Free viewpoint Action Recognition Using Motion History Volumes*. Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 104(2-3):249–257, 2006.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper references.
