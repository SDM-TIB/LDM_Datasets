To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pixel-Wise PolSAR Image Classification via a Novel Complex-Valued Deep Fully Convolutional Network" by Yice Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental analysis sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on real PolSAR datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental analysis section**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three benchmark PolSAR datasets:

1. **Flevoland Benchmark Dataset**: This dataset was acquired by NASA/JPL AIRSAR in 1991 and has a size of 1020×1024 pixels. It includes 14 classes such as potato, fruit, oats, and others.

2. **San Francisco Dataset**: This dataset is a full PolSAR image that provides coverage of four targets: water, vegetation, low-density urban, and high-density urban. The original data has a dimension of 900×1024 pixels.

3. **Oberpfaffenhofen Dataset**: This dataset is an ESAR data of the Oberpfaffenhofen area in Germany, with a size of 1300×1200 pixels. It contains three classes: built-up areas, woodland, and open areas.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely well-known benchmark datasets in the field of remote sensing.

To summarize the datasets with their details:
- **Flevoland Benchmark Dataset**: Acquired by NASA/JPL AIRSAR in 1991, size 1020×1024 pixels, 14 classes.
- **San Francisco Dataset**: AIRSAR full PolSAR image, size 900×1024 pixels, covers water, vegetation, low-density urban, and high-density urban.
- **Oberpfaffenhofen Dataset**: ESAR data from Germany, size 1300×1200 pixels, includes built-up areas, woodland, and open areas.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant citations or references, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the representation of each dataset.
