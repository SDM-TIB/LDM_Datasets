To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Medical Image Segmentation via Sparse Coding Decoder" by Long Zeng and Kaigui Wu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method on the **Synapse benchmark**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and evaluation metrics)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they describe the **Synapse multi-organ dataset**, which consists of 30 abdominal CT scans, detailing the number of slices, resolution, and the anatomical structures targeted for segmentation.

The description includes:
- The dataset contains 30 abdominal CT scans with a total of 3779 axial contrast-enhanced images.
- Each scan has between 85 and 198 slices, with a resolution of 512 Ã— 512 pixels.
- The dataset is used to segment eight anatomical structures: aorta, gallbladder, left kidney, right kidney, liver, pancreas, spleen, and stomach.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Synapse dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the Synapse dataset itself. Therefore, I will note that while the dataset is mentioned, the authors do not provide a formal citation in this paper.

Since the Synapse dataset is widely recognized in the medical imaging community, I will include a general reference to the dataset based on its common usage in literature, but I will clarify that the specific citation is not provided in this paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and any relevant details, along with the citation information as best as I can.

In summary, the key steps are:
1. Identify the dataset mentioned in the abstract and methods.
2. Extract detailed information from section 4.1.
3. Note the absence of a formal citation for the Synapse dataset in the references.
4. Prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the necessary details about the dataset used in this research paper.
