To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FIT: Far-reaching Interleaved Transformers" by Ting Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. In the introduction, the authors often discuss the context of their work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors evaluate their architecture on high-resolution image understanding and generation tasks, which suggests that they likely used specific datasets for these evaluations.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize results, as these often include the names of datasets. For instance, the authors mention evaluating their architecture on tasks such as Pix2Seq object detection and pixel-based autoregressive modeling, which implies the use of datasets like Objects365 and ImageNet.

Once I identify the datasets, I will need to find the **full citations** for each dataset. This information is typically located in the **references section** of the paper. I will look for the original papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, if the paper mentions the **Objects365 dataset**, I will find its citation, which might look something like this:
> Shuai Shao, Zeming Li, Tianyuan Zhang, Chao Peng, Gang Yu, Xiangyu Zhang, Jing Li, and Jian Sun. *Objects365: A large-scale, high-quality dataset for object detection*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 8430–8439, 2019.

Similarly, for the **ImageNet dataset**, I will locate its citation, which could be:
> Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211–252, 2015.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset names along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets mentioned in the paper, including any additional datasets that may be referenced in the context of experiments or comparisons with other methods.
