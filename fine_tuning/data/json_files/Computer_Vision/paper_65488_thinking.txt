To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting Machine Unlearning for Backdoor Attacks in Deep Learning System" by Peixin Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that might be mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "4 datasets which are commonly used in the literature," suggesting that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant sections that might describe the datasets used in the experiments. In this case, I will focus on **Section 5 (Evaluation of Attack)**, where the authors mention the datasets used for their experiments.

Upon reviewing Section 5, I find that the authors explicitly list the datasets they used:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, containing 60,000 training samples and 10,000 testing samples of 28x28 grayscale images.
   
2. **Fashion-MNIST**: This dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images from 10 clothing categories, also in grayscale and of the same dimensions as MNIST.

3. **German Traffic Sign Benchmark (GTSRB)**: A dataset containing 34,799 training instances and 12,630 testing instances of images for recognizing 43 different traffic signs.

4. **CIFAR10**: A dataset that includes 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, divided into 10 non-overlapping categories, with each image being 32x32 pixels in color.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited in any subsequent work or analysis.
