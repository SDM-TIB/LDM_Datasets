To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Low-complexity Approximate Convolutional Neural Networks" by R. J. Cintra et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the application of their approach on three use cases, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is typically where authors describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention three use cases: face detection, handwritten digit classification, and a larger ConvNet for image classification. I will need to identify the specific datasets used for these tasks.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used:
1. **FDDB (Face Detection Data Set and Benchmark)**: This dataset is used for evaluating face detection algorithms. It contains 2,845 images and is referenced in the context of the face detection task.
2. **MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology)**: This dataset is widely used for handwritten digit classification and contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits.
3. **ImageNet**: This dataset is used for large-scale image classification tasks and contains millions of images across thousands of categories.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and should be formatted correctly.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:
- For **FDDB**:
  > Jain, V., & Learned-Miller, E. (2010). FDDB: A benchmark for face detection in unconstrained settings. Tech. Rep. UM-CS-2010-009, University of Massachusetts, Amherst.

- For **MNIST**:
  > LeCun, Y., Cortes, C., & Burges, C. J. C. (2015). The MNIST database of handwritten digits. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

- For **ImageNet**:
  > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., et al. (2015). ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3), 211-252.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately.
