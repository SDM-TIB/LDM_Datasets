To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inferring Latent Class Statistics from Text for Robust Visual Few-Shot Learning" by Yassir Bendou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of text-derived statistics to enhance few-shot learning, which suggests that datasets are involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically section 4) where the authors detail their experimental protocol. In **section 4.1**, they mention using two base datasets: **ImageNet** and **iNaturalist**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their significance in the context of the experiments.

In **section 4.1**, the authors describe the **iNaturalist** dataset as a hierarchical dataset with fine-grained classes, which is crucial for their analysis of covariance in visual features. They also mention that they use **ImageNet** as a base dataset for their experiments.

Furthermore, in **section 4.1**, the authors list several cross-domain datasets used for testing, including **Caltech**, **EuroSAT**, **Food**, **Flowers**, **SUN397**, **DTD**, **Pets**, **Cars**, and **UCF101**. I will ensure to document these datasets as well.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for clarity and proper attribution. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
