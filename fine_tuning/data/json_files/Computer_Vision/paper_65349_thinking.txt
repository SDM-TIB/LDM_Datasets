To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Federated Class-Incremental Learning with Prompting" by Jiale Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on **CIFAR-100, Mini-ImageNet, and Tiny-ImageNet**, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they describe:

1. **CIFAR-100**: A labeled subset of a set of 80 million natural images for object recognition, consisting of 60,000 color images across 100 classes, with 500 images for training and 100 for testing.

2. **Mini-ImageNet**: A subset of ImageNet that includes 100 classes, with each class split into 500 training and 100 test samples.

3. **Tiny-ImageNet**: Another subset of ImageNet, containing 200 classes, each with 500 training images, 50 validation images, and 50 testing images.

The authors also provide specific details about the image sizes for each dataset, which is useful for understanding the context of their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **Mini-ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In CVPR, 2009.

- For **Tiny-ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Ya Le and Xuan Yang. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. CS 231N, 2015.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for any future reference or use.
