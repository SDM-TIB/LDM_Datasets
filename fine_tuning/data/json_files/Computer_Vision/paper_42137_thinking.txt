To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ensemble Noise Simulation to Handle Uncertainty about Gradient-based Adversarial Attacks" by Rehana Mahfuz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions using the **MNIST-Digit** and **CIFAR-10** datasets for classification tasks, which indicates that these datasets are central to the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experimental setup section** in detail. Here, the authors explicitly state that they used the **MNIST-Digit** dataset, which consists of 28x28 pixel images, and the **CIFAR-10** dataset, which consists of 32x32 pixel images. Both datasets are used for classifying images into one of 10 classes. This confirms their relevance to the study.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **MNIST-Digit dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. [Online]. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
