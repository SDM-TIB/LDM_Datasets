To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Adaptive Policy to Employ Sharpness-Aware Minimization" by Weisen Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses experimental results on "various datasets and architectures," which suggests that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) to find detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors mention conducting experiments on **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **ImageNet**. These are well-known datasets in the field of machine learning, particularly for image classification tasks.

I will also check the **related work** and **conclusion** sections to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or referenced. However, the primary datasets used for the experiments appear to be clearly stated in the experiments section.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **CIFAR-10**:
   > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. E. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Technical report.

2. **CIFAR-100**:
   > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. E. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Technical report.

3. **ImageNet**:
   > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., Berg, A. C., & Fei-Fei, L. (2015). ImageNet large scale visual recognition challenge. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3), 211-252.

After confirming the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- CIFAR-10
- CIFAR-100
- ImageNet

I will ensure that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation as provided above.
