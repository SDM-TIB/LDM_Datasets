To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Updating CLIP to Prefer Descriptions Over Captions" by Amir Zur et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of the **Concadia dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research. The introduction further elaborates on the dataset, stating that it consists of 96,918 images with corresponding descriptions, captions, and textual context. This confirms that the Concadia dataset is indeed a primary dataset used in the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets in detail. In this paper, the dataset is primarily discussed in the **Methods** section, where the authors describe how they fine-tuned the CLIP model using the Concadia dataset. They provide details about the dataset's structure, which includes triplets of images, descriptions, and captions.

I will also check the **experiments** section to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors refer to any other datasets used for evaluation. However, the focus remains on the Concadia dataset throughout the paper.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the Concadia dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Kreiss, E., Fang, F., Goodman, N., & Potts, C. (2022). Concadia: Towards image-based text generation with a purpose. In Proceedings of the 2022 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 4667â€“4684.

Since the Concadia dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will summarize my findings:

1. **Concadia Dataset**: This dataset is used to fine-tune the CLIP model to prefer descriptions over captions. It consists of 96,918 images with corresponding descriptions, captions, and textual context.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details about the dataset used in the research.
