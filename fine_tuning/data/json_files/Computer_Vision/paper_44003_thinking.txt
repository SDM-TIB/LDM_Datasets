To extract datasets from the research paper titled "E2GC: Energy-efficient Group Convolution in Deep Neural Networks" by Nandan Kumar Jha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on two image classification datasets: **ImageNet-1K** and **Food-101**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research and should be included in my extraction.

Next, I will look into the **experimental results section (Section IV)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. They mention that **ImageNet-1K** consists of 1.2 million training samples and 50,000 validation samples categorized into 1,000 classes. The **Food-101** dataset is described as having 75,750 training samples and 25,250 validation samples across 101 classes. This confirms the datasets' relevance and provides additional details that will be useful for the extraction.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets easily.

For **ImageNet-1K**, the citation is:
> J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L. Li, K. Li, and F. Li. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248–255, 2009.

For **Food-101**, the citation is:
> L. Bossard, G. Guillaumin, and L. Van Gool. *Food-101 – mining discriminative components with random forests*. In Computer Vision – ECCV 2014, pages 446–461, 2014.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its relevant details and full citation. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
