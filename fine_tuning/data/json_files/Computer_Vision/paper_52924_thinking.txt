To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Generative Deep Learning Approach to Stochastic Downscaling of Precipitation Forecasts" by Lucy Harris et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets used for training or validation. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets, while the methods section typically details the datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of precipitation forecasts and the need for improved methods, which may hint at the datasets they utilize. I will look for specific names or descriptions of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **data section** (Section 2) of the paper, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **IFS Operational Forecast Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from the ECMWF and includes operational forecast data from 2016 to 2020. It is used as input for the model and consists of various atmospheric fields.

2. **NIMROD Radar Dataset**: This dataset serves as the "truth" dataset and provides high-resolution precipitation data from the Met Office's NIMROD system, covering the same time period (2016-2020). It is crucial for validating the model's predictions.

Additionally, the authors mention using **geographic data** to enhance model performance, which includes high-resolution surface geopotential and land-sea mask data.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **IFS Operational Forecast Dataset**, the citation is:
  > European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). *IFS Operational Forecast Dataset*. Retrieved from https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/access-forecasts/access-archive-datasets.

- For the **NIMROD Radar Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Met Office. (2003). *1km Resolution UK Composite Rainfall Data from the Met Office NIMROD System*. NCAS British Atmospheric Data Centre. Retrieved from https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/27dd6ffba67f667a18c62de5c3456350.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets relevant to the research conducted in the paper.
