To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Propagating Semantic Labels in Video Data" by David Balaban et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a method for labeling large sets of images derived from video, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors describe their Semantic Label Propagation (SLP) system. They mention that the system outputs a set of objects corresponding to binary masks for each frame, indicating that they have created a dataset suitable for training or fine-tuning models. However, I need to find specific names and details of the datasets.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors discuss the performance of SLP across five videos, providing a summary table (Table I) that includes metrics such as the number of frames, time to complete Structure from Motion (SfM), number of mesh faces, and average Intersection over Union (IoU) scores. This indicates that the datasets are derived from these five videos.

I will now look for any explicit mentions of the datasets in the **results or discussion sections**. The authors refer to the "ground truth labels" collected from five videos, which were manually labeled by volunteers. They also mention that this data will be made publicly available upon publication at the Texas Robotics Dataverse, which is a crucial detail for citation.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets. The authors reference the Pixel Annotation Tool, which is used for manual labeling, but I need to ensure that I capture the full citation for the dataset derived from the videos.

The datasets are as follows:

1. **Video Dataset**: The dataset consists of five videos used for evaluating the SLP system. The authors do not provide specific titles for these videos, but they mention that the data will be publicly available at the Texas Robotics Dataverse.

2. **Ground Truth Labels**: The authors collected ground truth labels from the five videos, which were manually labeled by volunteers using the Pixel Annotation Tool. This is an important aspect of the dataset.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets:

- For the **Pixel Annotation Tool**, the citation is:
  > A. Bréhéret, Pixel Annotation Tool, https://github.com/abreheret/PixelAnnotationTool, 2017.

- The dataset derived from the five videos does not have a specific citation yet, but I will note that it will be available at the Texas Robotics Dataverse upon publication.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the necessary citations for each dataset.
