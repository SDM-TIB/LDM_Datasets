To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Architecturing Binarized Neural Networks for Traffic Sign Recognition" by Andreea Postovan and Mădălina Erașcu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used the **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)** for training and also mentions the Belgian and Chinese datasets for testing. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Datasets and Experimental Setting)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)**: This dataset is described as a multi-class, single-image dataset consisting of images of German road signs in 43 classes, with a total of 51,839 images (39,209 for training and 12,630 for testing). The authors note the challenges posed by this dataset, such as perspective changes and lighting conditions.

2. **Belgian Traffic Signs Dataset**: The authors state that this dataset contains 7,095 images of 62 classes, with 4,533 images used for training. They also mention that only 23 classes match those from GTSRB.

3. **Chinese Traffic Signs Dataset**: This dataset includes 5,998 images for testing across 58 classes, with only 15 classes matching those from GTSRB. The authors describe the preprocessing steps taken to align the classes with GTSRB.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **GTSRB**, the citation is:
  > Houben, S., Stallkamp, J., Salmen, J., Schlipsing, M., & Igel, C. (2013). *Detection of Traffic Signs in Real-World Images: The German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark*. In The 2013 international joint conference on neural networks (IJCNN), pp. 1–8. IEEE.

- For the **Belgian Traffic Signs Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Belgian Traffic Sign Database. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shazaelmorsh/trafficsigns, accessed: March 25th, 2023.

- For the **Chinese Traffic Signs Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chinese Traffic Sign Database. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dmitryyemelyanov/chinese-traffic-signs, accessed: March 25th, 2023.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be clearly described, and full citations will be included to ensure proper attribution.
