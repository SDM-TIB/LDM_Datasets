To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tighter Variational Bounds are Not Necessarily Better" by Amine Mâ€™Charrak et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments conducted, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the context of their work. They mention that extensive experiments were performed on multiple datasets, specifically **MNIST** and **Omniglot**. This indicates that these datasets are central to their research.

In the **results section**, the authors detail their experiments and mention the datasets again, confirming their use in the evaluation of the proposed methods. They state that they followed the dataset processing steps described in the original paper on IWAE, which suggests that the datasets are well-defined and standardized.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For **Omniglot**, the citation is:
  > Orhan G. and A. A. *Omniglot: A Dataset for One-Shot Learning*. 2015. Available at: https://github.com/brendenlake/omniglot

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
