To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continuous Diffusion for Mixed-Type Tabular Data" by Markus Mueller, Kathrin Gruber, and Dennis Fok, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention that they consider six different datasets to evaluate their model. I will note down the names of these datasets and any relevant details provided about them.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the datasets in detail, including their characteristics such as the prediction task, total number of observations, and the number of categorical and continuous features. This information is crucial for understanding the context in which the datasets are used.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important because the datasets often have associated publications or repositories that provide additional context and validation for their use.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Adult Dataset**: Used for binary classification, containing 48,842 observations with 9 categorical features and 6 continuous features.
   - Citation: Becker, B., & Kohavi, R. (1996). *Adult*. UCI Machine Learning Repository. DOI: https://doi.org/10.24432/C5XW20.

2. **Bank Marketing Dataset**: Another binary classification dataset with 41,188 observations, 11 categorical features, and 10 continuous features.
   - Citation: Moro, S., Rita, P., & Cortez, P. (2012). *Bank Marketing*. UCI Machine Learning Repository. DOI: https://doi.org/10.24432/C5K306.

3. **Beijing PM2.5 Data**: A regression dataset with 41,757 observations, 1 categorical feature, and 10 continuous features.
   - Citation: Chen, S. (2017). *Beijing PM2.5 Data*. UCI Machine Learning Repository. DOI: https://doi.org/10.24432/C5JS49.

4. **Iranian Churn Dataset**: Used for binary classification, containing 3,150 observations with 5 categorical features and 9 continuous features.
   - Citation: Iranian Churn Dataset. (2020). UCI Machine Learning Repository. DOI: https://doi.org/10.24432/C5JW3Z.

5. **Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset**: Another binary classification dataset with 30,000 observations, 10 categorical features, and 14 continuous features.
   - Citation: Yeh, I.-C. (2016). *Default of credit card clients*. UCI Machine Learning Repository. DOI: https://doi.org/10.24432/C55S3H.

6. **Demand for Medical Care by the Elderly Dataset**: A regression dataset with 4,406 observations, 8 categorical features, and 11 continuous features.
   - Citation: Deb, P., & Trivedi, P. K. (1997). *Demand for Medical Care by the Elderly: A Finite Mixture Approach*. Journal of Applied Econometrics, 12(3), 313â€“336. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1255(199705)12:3<313::AID-JAE440>3.0.CO;2-G.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
