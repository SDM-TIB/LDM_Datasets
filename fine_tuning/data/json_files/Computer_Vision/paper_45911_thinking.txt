To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understand Watchdogs: Discover How Game Bot Get Discovered" by Eunji Park, Kyung Ho Park, and Huy Kang Kim, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed an XAI model using a dataset from the Korean MMORPG, AION, which includes game logs of human players and game bots. This suggests that there is a specific dataset that I need to focus on.

Next, I will look at the **experiments section**, particularly **section 3.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they used the game dataset from AION, which contains game log data from 49,530 players, including 6,213 bots. The data collection period is specified as being from April 10 to July 5, covering 88 days. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides essential details about its composition.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from a specific game (AION) and is provided by NCSoft, I will need to cite the game itself as the source of the dataset. The citation for the game is as follows:

- **AION Dataset**: 
  > NCSoft. *AION*. [Online]. Available: https://www.ncsoft.com (Accessed: [insert access date]).

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **AION Dataset**: This dataset consists of game logs from 49,530 players, including 6,213 bots, collected over a period of 88 days. The dataset is used to analyze patterns of malicious players and is crucial for the authors' experiments on game bot detection.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details and citations for the dataset used in the research paper.
