To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Generalization in Reinforcement Learning with Mixture Regularization" by Kaixin Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors verify their method on the **Procgen benchmark**, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. They mention conducting extensive experiments on the **Procgen Benchmark**, which consists of 16 procedurally generated game-like environments. This indicates that the Procgen Benchmark is a key dataset used in their research.

In the **experiments section**, the authors specify that they focus on 6 environments from the Procgen Benchmark: **Caveflyer, Climber, Dodgeball, Fruitbot, Jumper, and Starpilot**. This confirms that these specific environments are part of the dataset they utilized for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Procgen Benchmark. The relevant citation is:
> Cobbe, K., Hesse, C., Hilton, J., and Schulman, J. (2019). *Leveraging procedural generation to benchmark reinforcement learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1912.01588.

Since the Procgen Benchmark is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about it, including its environments and the citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Procgen Benchmark, ensuring that I include all relevant details and the full citation as required.
