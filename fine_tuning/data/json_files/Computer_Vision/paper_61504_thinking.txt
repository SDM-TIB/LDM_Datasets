To extract datasets from the research paper titled "High-Fidelity Image Compression with Score-based Generative Models" by Emiel Hoogeboom et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of their method on various datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will examine **section 5.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Kodak Dataset**: This dataset contains 24 images, each either 512×768 pixels or the inverse.
2. **CLIC201 Dataset**: This dataset includes 428 images of varying resolutions, up to 2000 pixels wide.
3. **CLIC22 Dataset**: This is a test set containing 30 high-resolution images, resized such that the longer side is 2048 pixels.
4. **MS-COCO 30k Dataset**: A dataset of 30,000 images, each 256×256 pixels.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Kodak Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kodak. PhotoCD PCD0992, 1993.

- For the **CLIC201 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Challenge on Learned Image Compression, 2022.

- For the **CLIC22 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Challenge on Learned Image Compression, 2022.

- For the **MS-COCO 30k Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge J. Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. Microsoft COCO: common objects in context. In Computer Vision - ECCV 2014 - 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V, 2014.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details from the paper regarding the datasets used in their research.
