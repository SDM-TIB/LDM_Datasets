To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can Physician Judgment Enhance Model Trustworthiness? A Case Study on Predicting Pathological Lymph Nodes in Rectal Cancer" by Kazuma Kobayashi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may include references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the **dataset preparation** subsection. Here, the authors describe the data collection process, including the number of patients and the types of data collected. They mention that data was collected from **900 rectal cancer patients**, which is a clear indication of the dataset size.

In the **dataset preparation section**, the authors detail how the data was split into training, validation, and testing datasets. They specify that **821 cases** were used for the complete dataset, with **661 patients** in the training set, **60 patients** in the validation set, and **100 patients** in the testing set. Additionally, they mention **79 cases** with missing clinical information that were included in a pre-training dataset.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used for training and evaluation, ensuring that I capture any additional details about the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The paper may not provide specific citations for the datasets used, as they are likely derived from clinical data collected by the authors. However, I will note any relevant studies or datasets referenced in the context of their methodology.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the datasets where applicable. If the datasets are original to the study, I will note that as well.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial dataset mentions.
2. Focus on the methods section, particularly the dataset preparation subsection, to gather detailed information about the datasets.
3. Confirm dataset usage in the experiments section.
4. Check the references for any relevant citations.
5. Compile the dataset information, including full citations where applicable.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the study.
