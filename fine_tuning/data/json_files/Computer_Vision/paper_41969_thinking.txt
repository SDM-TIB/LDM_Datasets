To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PrivGAN: Protecting GANs from membership inference attacks at low cost" by Sumit Mukherjee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of their model on several benchmark datasets. This indicates that there are datasets used in their experiments, which I need to identify.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiment Details)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention four datasets:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits, consisting of 70,000 images (60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples).
2. **Fashion-MNIST**: Similar to MNIST but contains images of clothing items, also with 70,000 images (60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples).
3. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of colored images of everyday objects, containing 60,000 images (50,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples).
4. **Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)**: A dataset of face images, comprising 13,223 images.

I will then confirm the details of these datasets by checking the **experiment details** section to ensure that I have the correct descriptions and sizes.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **MNIST**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
