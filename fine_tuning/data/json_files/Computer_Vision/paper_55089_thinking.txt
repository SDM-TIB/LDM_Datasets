To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Patching open-vocabulary models by interpolating weights" by Gabriel Ilharco et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup. This section often includes detailed information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup."

In the **results section**, I will check for any additional datasets that may be referenced in the context of the experiments conducted. The authors may discuss the performance of their model on various datasets, which could provide further insights into the datasets used.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the necessary details for each one, including:

1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics (e.g., number of classes, types of data).
3. **Full Citation**: The complete citation for the dataset, which typically includes the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if I find that the paper uses the "MNIST" dataset, I would document it as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: MNIST
- **Description**: A dataset of handwritten digits, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each labeled with the corresponding digit.
- **Full Citation**: Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented and formatted consistently. This will allow for easy reference and understanding of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will compile all the dataset entries into a structured format for review or further processing, ensuring that the full citations are included for each dataset to maintain academic integrity and provide proper credit to the original sources.
