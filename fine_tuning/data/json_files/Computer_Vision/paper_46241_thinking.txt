To extract datasets from the research paper titled "iNeRF: Inverting Neural Radiance Fields for Pose Estimation" by Lin Yen-Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a framework for pose estimation and hints at the use of datasets for evaluation. This suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using the **LLFF dataset** for real-world scenes and a **synthetic dataset** from NeRF for their experiments. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets.

In the **results section**, the authors provide insights into their experiments on the LLFF dataset, which includes complex scenes like Fern, Fortress, Horns, and Room. They also mention using the **ShapeNet dataset** for category-level object pose estimation, specifically focusing on the "car" classes.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **LLFF Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P Srinivasan, Rodrigo Ortiz-Cayon, Nima Khademi Kalantari, Ravi Ramamoorthi, Ren Ng, and Abhishek Kar. *Local light field fusion: Practical view synthesis with prescriptive sampling guidelines*. ACM TOG, 2019.

2. **ShapeNet Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Vincent Sitzmann, Michael ZollhÃ¶fer, and Gordon Wetzstein. *Scene representation networks: Continuous 3D-structure-aware neural scene representations*. NeurIPS, 2019.

3. **NeRF Synthetic Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P Srinivasan, Matthew Tancik, Jonathan T Barron, Ravi Ramamoorthi, and Ren Ng. *Nerf: Representing scenes as neural radiance fields for view synthesis*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.08934, 2020.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **LLFF Dataset**: Used for evaluating iNeRF on real-world scenes, consisting of complex scenes captured with a handheld cellphone.
- **ShapeNet Dataset**: Specifically the "car" classes, used for category-level object pose estimation.
- **NeRF Synthetic Dataset**: Used for testing iNeRF on synthetic scenes.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately noted the full citations for each dataset, as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work or analysis.
