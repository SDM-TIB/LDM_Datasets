To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UPFUSION: NOVEL VIEW DIFFUSION FROM UNPOSED SPARSE VIEW OBSERVATIONS" by Bharath Raj Nagoor Kani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on the **Co3Dv2** and **Google Scanned Objects** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will delve into the **experiments section** (specifically section 4.1.1) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly state that they use the **Co3Dv2** dataset, which consists of multi-view sequences from 51 categories, and the **Google Scanned Objects** dataset for evaluation against single-view methods. This confirms the datasets' relevance and usage in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Co3Dv2 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Jonathan T. Barron, Ben Mildenhall, Matthew Tancik, Peter Hedman, Ricardo Martin-Brualla, and Pratul P. Srinivasan. *Common Objects in 3D: Large-Scale Learning and Evaluation of Real-Life 3D Category Reconstruction*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021.

2. For the **Google Scanned Objects dataset**, the citation is:
   > Laura Downs, Anthony Francis, Nate Koenig, Brandon Kinman, Ryan Hickman, Krista Reymann, Thomas B McHugh, and Vincent Vanhoucke. *Google Scanned Objects: A High-Quality Dataset of 3D Scanned Household Items*. In 2022 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2022.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Co3Dv2**: A large-scale dataset with real multi-view images of objects from 51 categories, used for training and testing the proposed method.
- **Google Scanned Objects**: A dataset containing high-quality 3D scanned household items, used for evaluation against single-view methods.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
