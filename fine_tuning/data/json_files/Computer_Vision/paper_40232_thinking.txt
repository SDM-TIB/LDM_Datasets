To extract datasets from the research paper titled "k-GANs: Ensemble of Generative Models with Semi-Discrete Optimal Transport" by Luca Ambrogioni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the k-GANs method and its performance but does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the **introduction** to look for any references to datasets used in the experiments.

In the **experiments section (Section 10)**, the authors mention validating the k-GANs method on two image datasets: **MNIST** and **Fashion MNIST**. They describe how they applied the k-GANs algorithm on these datasets and provide some details about the experiments conducted.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **MNIST Dataset**:
   > Y. LeCun, L. Bottou, Y. Bengio, P. Haffner, et al. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278â€“2324, 1998.

2. **Fashion MNIST Dataset**:
   > H. Xiao, K. Rasul, and R. Vollgraf. *Fashion-mnist: a novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, which is crucial for proper attribution in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
