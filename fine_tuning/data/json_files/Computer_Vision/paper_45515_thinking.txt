To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Suppressing Mislabeled Data via Grouping and Self-Attention" by Xiaojiang Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to their method being validated on two real-world noisy datasets: **Food101N** and **Clothing1M**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Datasets and Implementation Details)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they describe:

1. **Food101N**: This dataset consists of 365,000 images crawled from various sources, with an annotation accuracy of about 80%. The clean version of this dataset, **Food-101**, contains 101 food categories with a total of 101,000 images, where 750 images per class are used for training and 250 for testing.

2. **Clothing1M**: This dataset contains 1 million images of clothing across 14 categories, with a low annotation accuracy of 61.54% due to the labels being generated from surrounding text on the web. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets, with 50,000, 14,000, and 10,000 images respectively.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Food101N**, the citation is:
  > Lee, K.H., He, X., Zhang, L., Yang, L. "CleanNet: Transfer Learning for Scalable Image Classifier Training with Label Noise." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 5447–5456, 2018.

- For **Clothing1M**, the citation is:
  > Xiao, T., Xia, T., Yang, Y., Huang, C., Wang, X. "Learning from Massive Noisy Labeled Data for Image Classification." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 2691–2699, 2015.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
