To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Score-based Generative Modeling in Latent Space" by Arash Vahdat et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. In the abstract, the authors reference achieving state-of-the-art results on **CIFAR-10** and **CelebA-HQ-256**, which indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** for detailed descriptions of the datasets. In this section, the authors explicitly mention using **CIFAR-10** and **CelebA-HQ-256** for their evaluations. They also mention modeling binary images using the **OMNIGLOT** dataset and **MNIST**. This gives me a clear list of datasets to document.

Now, I will look into the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

1. **CIFAR-10**: The CIFAR-10 dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, and its citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

2. **CelebA-HQ**: The CelebA-HQ dataset is a high-quality version of the CelebA dataset, and its citation is:
   > Tero Karras, Miika Aittala, Janne Hellsten, Samuli Laine, Jaakko Lehtinen, and Timo Aila. *Progressive growing of GANs for improved quality, stability, and variation*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2018.

3. **OMNIGLOT**: The OMNIGLOT dataset is often used for few-shot learning tasks, and its citation is:
   > J. Lake, M. Salakhutdinov, and Y. Tenenbaum. *Human-level concept learning through probabilistic program induction*. Science, 350(6266):1332-1338, 2015.

4. **MNIST**: The MNIST dataset is a classic dataset for handwritten digit recognition, and its citation is:
   > Yann LeCun. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, 1998.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
