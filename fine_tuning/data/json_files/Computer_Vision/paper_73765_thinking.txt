To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mixture of Rationale: Multi-Modal Reasoning Mixture for Visual Question Answering" by Tao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method on **two challenging VQA datasets, NLVR2 and OKVQA-S**. This indicates that these datasets are central to their research.

Next, I will look closely at the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they explicitly state that they chose **NLVR2** and **OKVQA-S** for their experiments. The authors provide a brief description of each dataset, highlighting the challenges they present for multi-modal reasoning.

In the **experiments section**, they describe NLVR2 as requiring the model to compare, locate, and count objects based on given questions and images. They also mention that OKVQA-S is a challenging category of the OKVQA dataset that requires external knowledge to answer questions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **NLVR2**, the citation is:
   > Alane Suhr, Stephanie Zhou, Ally Zhang, Iris Zhang, Huajun Bai, and Yoav Artzi. *A corpus for reasoning about natural language grounded in photographs*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 6418–6428, Florence, Italy, 2019.

2. For **OKVQA-S**, the citation is:
   > Kenneth Marino, Mohammad Rastegari, Ali Farhadi, and Roozbeh Mottaghi. *OK-VQA: A visual question answering benchmark requiring external knowledge*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3195–3204, 2019.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **NLVR2**: A dataset that requires models to compare, locate, and count objects based on questions and images.
- **OKVQA-S**: A challenging subset of the OKVQA dataset that necessitates the use of external knowledge for answering questions.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
