To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Domain Learning CNN Model for Microscopy Image Classification" by Duc Hoa Tran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The authors state that they evaluated their model on three different public datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or names of the datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of microscopy image classification and mentions the need for a model that can handle multiple domains, but it does not specify the datasets yet.

I will then focus on the **Materials and Methods** section, particularly **section 3.3.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors summarize the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Lymphoma Dataset**: This dataset consists of 375 images across 3 classes, with dimensions of 1388 × 1040 × 3.
2. **Pap-smear Dataset**: This dataset contains 917 images across 2 classes, with dimensions of 45 × 43 × 3 to 1388 × 1040 × 3.
3. **HeLa Dataset**: This dataset includes 862 images across 10 classes, with dimensions ranging from 768 × 284 × 3 to 382 × 382 × 1.

The paper also mentions a combined dataset called **Mix**, which consists of images from the three datasets, totaling 2154 images across 15 classes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The authors reference the following papers for the datasets:

- For the **Lymphoma Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lior Shamir, Nikita Orlov, D. Mark Eckley, Tomasz J. Macura, and Ilya G. Goldberg. *IICBU 2008: a proposed benchmark suite for biological image analysis*. Medical Biol. Eng. Comput., 46(9):943–947, 2008.

- For the **Pap-smear Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jan Jantzen, Jonas Norup, George Dounias, and Beth Bjerregaard. *Pap-smear benchmark data for pattern classification*. Nature Inspired Smart Information Systems (NiSIS), 01 2005.

- For the **HeLa Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lior Shamir, Nikita Orlov, D. Mark Eckley, Tomasz J. Macura, and Ilya G. Goldberg. *IICBU 2008: a proposed benchmark suite for biological image analysis*. Medical Biol. Eng. Comput., 46(9):943–947, 2008.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
