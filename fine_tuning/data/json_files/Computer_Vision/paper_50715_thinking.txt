To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scalable Mixed-Domain Gaussian Processes" by Juho Timonen and Harri Lähdesmäki, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and previous work, which may include dataset mentions.

In the **introduction**, I will pay attention to any applications or examples that might indicate the use of specific datasets. The authors discuss applications in longitudinal data analysis and computer experiments, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, particularly **Experiment 1, Experiment 2, and Experiment 3**, as these sections typically detail the datasets used for experiments. 

1. **Experiment 1** mentions a simulated longitudinal dataset created with 9 individuals, where categorical variables (id and z) and a continuous variable (age) are used. However, this dataset is generated for the purpose of the study and does not have a formal citation.

2. **Experiment 2** describes the use of Canadian weather data consisting of yearly average temperature measurements from 35 Canadian weather stations, with a total of 12,775 data points. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Ramsay, J. O., & Silverman, B. W. (2005). *Functional Data Analysis*. Springer, New York, NY, 2nd edition.

3. **Experiment 3** discusses the modeling of the vote share of the Republican Party in US presidential elections using data from the 1976-2016 elections. The citation for this dataset is:
   > MITElectionData and Science Lab. (2017). *U.S. President 1976–2020, V6*.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to document their details, including the context in which they were used and their respective citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that each dataset is properly cited as per the findings in the paper.
