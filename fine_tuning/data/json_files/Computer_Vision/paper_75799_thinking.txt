To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Difflare: Removing Image Lens Flare with Latent Diffusion Models" by Tianwen Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of a novel approach called Difflare for lens flare removal, but it does not specify any datasets. However, the introduction discusses the challenges of lens flare removal and hints at the use of datasets for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **related works section**. Here, the authors mention several datasets used in previous studies, particularly in the context of lens flare removal. They specifically reference the **Flare7K dataset**, which is a semi-synthetic benchmark dataset comprising 5,000 scattering flare (SF) and 2,000 reflective flare (RF) images. This is a key dataset for their work.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they utilized the **Flare7K dataset** for training their model. They also mention the use of the **Flickr24K dataset** for generating paired training sets, which is another dataset of interest.

Now, I will look into the **references section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Flare7K dataset**, the citation is:
   > Yuekun Dai, Chongyi Li, Shangchen Zhou, Ruicheng Feng, and Chen Change Loy. *Flare7K: A phenomenological nighttime flare removal dataset*. In Proceedings of the Thirty-sixth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track, 2022.

2. For the **Flickr24K dataset**, the citation is:
   > Xuaner Zhang, Ren Ng, and Qifeng Chen. *Single image reflection separation with perceptual losses*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2018.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **Flare7K Dataset**: A semi-synthetic dataset specifically designed for lens flare removal, containing 5,000 SF and 2,000 RF images.
- **Flickr24K Dataset**: A dataset used for generating paired training sets, which includes a variety of natural images.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
