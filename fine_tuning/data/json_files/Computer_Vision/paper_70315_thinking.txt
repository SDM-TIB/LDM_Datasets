To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking Transformers Pre-training for Multi-Spectral Satellite Imagery" by Mubashir Noman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on six datasets, which suggests that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the introduction, the authors mention two specific datasets used for pre-training: **fMoW-RGB** and **fMoW-Sentinel**. I will note these down as they are likely to be significant datasets for the study.

In the **experiments** section, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. They mention:

1. **fMoW-RGB**: This dataset is described as a large-scale publicly available dataset of high-resolution satellite images, divided into 62 categories for classification, comprising about 363,000 training and 53,000 test images.

2. **fMoW-Sentinel**: This dataset refines and extends the fMoW-RGB dataset and includes Sentinel-2 data. It also has 62 class categories and contains 712,874 training, 84,939 validation, and 84,966 test images.

Additionally, the authors mention four other datasets used for downstream tasks:

3. **EuroSAT**: A dataset for land use and land cover classification, categorized into 10 classes and comprising 27,000 images.

4. **RESISC-45**: A scene classification dataset with 31,500 images across 45 scene classes.

5. **UC-Merced**: A land use dataset containing 2,100 images across 21 scene classes.

6. **BigEarthNet**: A multi-label land cover classification dataset with 590,326 Sentinel-2 images categorized into 19 classes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
