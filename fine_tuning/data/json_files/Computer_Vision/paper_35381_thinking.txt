To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unpaired Multi-Domain Image Generation via Regularized Conditional GANs" by Xudong Mao and Qing Li, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed model on several tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenges of multi-domain image generation and reference previous works that may have used specific datasets. However, I need to look for explicit mentions of datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors explicitly mention several datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

2. **USPS Dataset**: Another dataset for handwritten digit recognition, containing 9,298 grayscale images of digits.

3. **Handbag Dataset**: Used for generating corresponding images of handbags, referenced from Zhu et al. (2016).

4. **Shoe Dataset**: Used for generating corresponding images of shoes, referenced from Yu and Grauman (2014).

5. **CelebA Dataset**: A large-scale face attributes dataset used for generating corresponding face images with different attributes, referenced from Liu et al. (2014).

6. **Chairs Dataset**: Used for generating corresponding images of chairs, referenced from Aubry et al. (2014).

7. **Cars Dataset**: Used for generating corresponding images of cars, referenced from Fidler et al. (2012).

8. **NYU Depth Dataset**: Used for learning a RegCGAN over photos and depth images, referenced from Silberman et al. (2012).

9. **Monet-Style Dataset**: Used for generating Monet-style images, referenced from Zhu et al. (2017).

10. **Summer and Winter Dataset**: Used for generating corresponding images of summer and winter scenes, also referenced from Zhu et al. (2017).

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution.

The full citations I will extract are:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
