To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Identity-Aware Deep Face Hallucination via Adversarial Face Verification" by Hadi Kazemi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention performing evaluations on the **LFW** and **BioID** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look closely at **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)**: This dataset contains 13,233 face images collected from the web, covering a variety of poses and expressions. The authors specify that they use the original aligned images of size 250 × 250 pixels, extracting 128 × 128 image patches as high-resolution (HR) images, and creating low-resolution (LR) images by down-sampling.

2. **BioID Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,521 face images, with 1,028 images used for training and 493 for testing. The images are aligned using the SDM method, and patches of size 160 × 120 are cropped from the center of each image.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **LFW dataset**, the citation is:
  > E. Learned-Miller, G. B. Huang, A. RoyChowdhury, H. Li, and G. Hua. *Labeled faces in the wild: A survey*. In Advances in face detection and facial image analysis, pages 189–248. Springer, 2016.

- For the **BioID dataset**, the citation is:
  > O. Jesorsky, K. J. Kirchberg, and R. W. Frischholz. *Robust face detection using the Hausdorff distance*. In International conference on audio-and video-based biometric person authentication, pages 90–95. Springer, 2001.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
