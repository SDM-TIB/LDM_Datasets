To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discrete Conditional Diffusion for Reranking in Recommendation" by Xiaokai Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that extensive offline experiments were conducted on public datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used in the research. The introduction will likely provide more context about these datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Avito Dataset**: This dataset consists of user search logs, containing over 53 million lists with 1.3 million users and 36 million ads. The authors specify that the impressions from the first 21 days are used for training, while the last 7 days are used for testing, with each list having a length of 5.

2. **VideoRerank Dataset**: Collected from Kuaishou, this dataset includes 100,102 users, 1,243,877 items, and 871,834 lists, with each list containing 6 items. The authors clarify that each sample corresponds to a real item sequence displayed to a user in a complete session.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Avito Dataset**:
  > Avito. *Avito Context Ad Clicks Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/avito-context-ad-clicks/data.

- For the **VideoRerank Dataset**:
  > Kuaishou. *VideoRerank Dataset*. Internal dataset collected from Kuaishou, a popular short-video app.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for future reference.
