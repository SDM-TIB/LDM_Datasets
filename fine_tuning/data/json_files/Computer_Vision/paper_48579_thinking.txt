To extract datasets from the research paper titled "k-Mixup Regularization for Deep Learning via Optimal Transport" by Kristjan Greenewald et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract states that the authors demonstrate empirical results on "benchmark datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors describe their empirical results on various datasets, including toy datasets, UCI datasets, and image datasets. I will focus on these sections to extract the names and descriptions of the datasets used.

In the **Results section**, the authors mention several datasets:
1. **Toy Datasets**: These include "One Ring," "Four Bars," and "Swiss Roll." They are used for binary classification tasks and are described in terms of their performance metrics.
2. **UCI Datasets**: The authors mention specific datasets such as:
   - **Iris Dataset**: 150 instances, 4 dimensions.
   - **Breast Cancer Wisconsin-Diagnostic Dataset**: 569 instances, 30 dimensions.
   - **Abalone Dataset**: 4177 instances, 8 dimensions.
   - **Arrhythmia Dataset**: 452 instances, 279 dimensions.
   - **HTRU2 Dataset**: 17898 instances, 9 dimensions.
   - **Phishing Dataset**: 11055 instances, 30 dimensions.
3. **Image Datasets**: The authors refer to standard datasets like **MNIST**, **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **SVHN**. These datasets are commonly used in image classification tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the UCI datasets and image datasets are typically available in the literature, and I will ensure to include them.

For example:
- **Iris Dataset** citation:
  > Fisher, R.A. "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems." Annals of Eugenics, 7(2): 179-188, 1936.
  
- **Breast Cancer Wisconsin-Diagnostic Dataset** citation:
  > Wolberg, W.H., & Mangasarian, O.L. "Multisurface method of pattern separation for medical diagnosis applied to breast fine-needle aspirates." Cancer Letters, 77(2): 163-171, 1994.

- **MNIST Dataset** citation:
  > LeCun, Y., Cortes, C., & Burges, C.J.C. "The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits." 2010.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
