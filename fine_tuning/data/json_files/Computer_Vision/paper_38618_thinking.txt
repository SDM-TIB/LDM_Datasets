To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretable preference learning: a game theoretic framework for large margin on-line feature and rule learning" by Mirko Polato and Fabio Aiolli, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in prior work or the current study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on four benchmark datasets: **tic-tac-toe**, **breast-cancer**, **poker**, and **mnist**. I will extract the relevant details about each dataset from this section.

1. **Tic-Tac-Toe Dataset**: This dataset contains 958 ending positions of the game tic-tac-toe, where the task is to classify whether the 'X' player is the winner.

2. **Breast-Cancer Dataset**: This is the Wisconsin Breast Cancer UCI dataset, which includes 682 hospital patients' values captured via a fine-needle aspiration test. The task is to classify tumors as benign or malignant.

3. **Poker Dataset**: This dataset consists of 25,010 poker hands, and the task is to classify the value of the hand (e.g., pair, full house, etc.). The authors derived three binary classification tasks from this dataset.

4. **MNIST Dataset**: The MNIST dataset is widely used for handwritten digit classification, consisting of images of digits stored in a 28x28 pixel matrix.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper cites the breast-cancer dataset as follows:
- For the breast-cancer dataset:
  > Hayashi, Y., and Nakano, S. (2015). Use of a recursive-rule extraction algorithm with j48graft to achieve highly accurate and concise rule extraction from a large breast cancer dataset. Informatics in Medicine Unlocked, 1, 9-16.

The other datasets are well-known and can be cited from their respective sources:
- **Tic-Tac-Toe Dataset**: The dataset is commonly referenced in machine learning literature but does not have a specific citation in this paper.
- **Poker Dataset**: This dataset is also widely used and may not have a specific citation in this paper.
- **MNIST Dataset**: The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
  > LeCun, Y., Cortes, C., and Burges, C. (1998). MNIST handwritten digit database. 

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly referenced. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
