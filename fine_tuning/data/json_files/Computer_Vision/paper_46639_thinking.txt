To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HighAir: A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network-Based Air Quality Forecasting Method" by Jiahui Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on the dataset of the Yangtze River Delta city group, which indicates that a specific dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of air quality data, POI (Points of Interest) data, and weather data collected from January 1 to December 21, 2018. This section will provide the necessary details about the datasets.

The paper specifies that:
1. **Air Quality Data**: This includes AQI (Air Quality Index) data collected from the National Urban Air Quality Real-time Release Platform at 1-hour granularity.
2. **POI Data**: Collected from the map engine of AMAP, which includes land usage information.
3. **Weather Data**: Collected from Envicloud and weather China, also at 1-hour granularity.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the sources of these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are derived from publicly available platforms. Therefore, I will note the sources as follows:

- For **Air Quality Data**:
  > National Urban Air Quality Real-time Release Platform. Available: http://106.37.208.233:20035/

- For **POI Data**:
  > AMAP. Available: https://lbs.amap.com/api/webservice/guide/api/search/

- For **Weather Data**:
  > Envicloud. Available: http://www.envicloud.cn/
  > Weather China. Available: http://www.weather.com.cn/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as specified.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
