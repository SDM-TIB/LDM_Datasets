To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differentially Private Graph Diffusion with Applications in Personalized PageRanks" by Rongzhe Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions experiments on real-world network data, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they explicitly mention three benchmark datasets:

1. **BlogCatalog**: This dataset is described as a social network of bloggers, containing 10,312 nodes and 333,983 edges.

2. **Flickr**: This dataset is a photo-sharing social network with 80,513 nodes and 5,899,882 edges.

3. **TheMarker**: This dataset is an online social network with 69,400 nodes and 1,600,000 edges.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **BlogCatalog**, the citation is:
  > R. Zafarani and H. Liu, “Social computing data repository at ASU,” 2009.

- For **Flickr**, the citation is:
  > R. A. Rossi and N. K. Ahmed, “The network data repository with interactive graph analytics and visualization,” in AAAI, 2015.

- For **TheMarker**, the citation is:
  > R. A. Rossi and N. K. Ahmed, “The network data repository with interactive graph analytics and visualization,” in AAAI, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **BlogCatalog**: A social network of bloggers with 10,312 nodes and 333,983 edges.
   - Citation: R. Zafarani and H. Liu, “Social computing data repository at ASU,” 2009.

2. **Flickr**: A photo-sharing social network with 80,513 nodes and 5,899,882 edges.
   - Citation: R. A. Rossi and N. K. Ahmed, “The network data repository with interactive graph analytics and visualization,” in AAAI, 2015.

3. **TheMarker**: An online social network with 69,400 nodes and 1,600,000 edges.
   - Citation: R. A. Rossi and N. K. Ahmed, “The network data repository with interactive graph analytics and visualization,” in AAAI, 2015.

With this information, I am ready to present the dataset entries in the required format for any further processing or analysis.
