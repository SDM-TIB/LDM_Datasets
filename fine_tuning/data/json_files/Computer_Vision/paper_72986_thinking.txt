To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Solar multi-object multi-frame blind deconvolution with a spatially variant convolution neural emulator" by A. Asensio Ramos, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset of images convolved with spatially invariant point spread functions, which indicates that there is a dataset involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **methods** section, particularly where the author discusses the training of the neural network. Here, the author mentions using **Stable ImageNet-1K**, a dataset of 512x512 pixel images generated with the Stable Diffusion model. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

I will also check the **results** section to see if any additional datasets are referenced or if there are any datasets used for validation or testing purposes. The author discusses the training and validation processes, which may provide further insights into the datasets used.

In the **references** section, I will look for full citations of the datasets mentioned. For **Stable ImageNet-1K**, the citation is:
> Rombach, R., Blattmann, A., Lorenz, D., Esser, P., & Ommer, B. (2022). *High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

Additionally, I will note that the author refers to using images from the **Stein & Nordlund (2012)** simulation, which is relevant for the validation of the model. The citation for this simulation is:
> Stein, R. F., & Nordlund, Ã…. (2012). *ApJ, 753, L13*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
