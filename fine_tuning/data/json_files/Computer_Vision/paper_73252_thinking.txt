To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion-Based Cloud-Edge-Device Collaborative Learning for Next POI Recommendations" by Guanhua Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluated their method using "two real-world datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper. This prompts me to look for those datasets in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Protocols)**. Here, the authors explicitly mention the two datasets used for evaluation: **Foursquare** and **Weeplace**. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

In subsection 4.1, the authors provide statistics for both datasets, including the number of users, POIs, categories, and check-ins. This information is crucial for describing the datasets comprehensively.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Foursquare**, the citation is:
  > Z. Chen, H. Cao, H. Wang, F. Xu, and Y. Li. 2020. Will You Come Back / Check-in Again? Understanding Characteristics Leading to Urban Revisitation and Re-check-in. Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive Mobile Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies (2020).

- For **Weeplace**, the citation is:
  > X. Liu, Y. Liu, K. Aberer, and C. Miao. 2013. Personalized point-of-interest recommendation by mining usersâ€™ preference transition. In ACM International Conference on Conference on Information & Knowledge Management.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Foursquare**: A dataset containing user check-in histories in cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, with a total of 4,560 users, 44,194 POIs, and 923,600 check-ins.

2. **Weeplace**: Another dataset with user check-in histories in the same cities, featuring 7,507 users, 80,962 POIs, and 1,214,631 check-ins.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
