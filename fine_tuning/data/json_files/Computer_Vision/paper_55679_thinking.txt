To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretable Edge Enhancement and Suppression Learning for 3D Point Cloud Segmentation" by Haoyi Xiu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in object part segmentation using **ShapeNet part** and scene segmentation using **S3DIS**. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **Experiments section**. In the experiments, the authors explicitly state that they used the **ShapeNet part dataset** for object part segmentation and the **S3DIS dataset** for scene segmentation. This confirms their usage in the study.

Now, I will gather detailed descriptions of each dataset:

1. **ShapeNet part dataset**: This dataset contains 16,881 3D models classified into 16 object categories, with each model annotated with several parts from 50 object part classes. This dataset is widely used for tasks involving 3D object recognition and segmentation.

2. **S3DIS dataset**: The Stanford Large-Scale 3D Indoor Spaces (S3DIS) dataset consists of 3D scans from six areas, including 272 rooms. Each point in the dataset is annotated with a class from 13 categories, making it suitable for scene segmentation tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **ShapeNet part dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yi, L., Kim, V. G., Ceylan, D., Shen, I.-C., Yan, H., Su, H., Lu, C., Huang, Q., Sheffer, A., & Guibas, L. (2016). A scalable active framework for region annotation in 3D shape collections. *ACM Transactions on Graphics (ToG)*, 35(6), 1-12.

- For the **S3DIS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Armeni, I., Sener, O., Zamir, A. R., Jiang, H., Brilakis, I., Fischer, M., & Savarese, S. (2016). 3D semantic parsing of large-scale indoor spaces. In *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition* (pp. 1534-1543).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
