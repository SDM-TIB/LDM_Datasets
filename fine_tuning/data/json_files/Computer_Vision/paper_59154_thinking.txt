To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conditioned layout generation with Joint Discrete-Continuous Diffusion Layout Transformer" by Elad Levi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their method on various layout generation datasets, which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **RICO**: This dataset provides user interface designs for mobile applications and contains 91,000 layouts with 27 different component types.

2. **PubLayNet**: This dataset consists of 330,000 samples of scientific documents, with layout components categorized into five types: text, title, figure, list, and table.

3. **Magazine**: This dataset contains 4,000 magazine pages with components from six categories: texts, images, headlines, over-image texts, over-image headlines, and backgrounds.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they evaluate their model on these three datasets, which reinforces their relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset:

- For **RICO**, the citation is:
  > Biplab Deka, Zifeng Huang, Chad Franzen, Joshua Hibschman, Daniel Afergan, Yang Li, Jeffrey Nichols, and Ranjitha Kumar. *Rico: A mobile app dataset for building data-driven design applications*. In Proceedings of the 30th Annual Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST), pages 569â€“579, 2017.

- For **PubLayNet**, the citation is:
  > Xu Zhong, Jianbin Tang, and Antonio Jimeno-Yepes. *PubLayNet: The largest dataset ever for document layout analysis*. CoRR, abs/1908.07836, 2019.

- For **Magazine**, the citation is:
  > Ying Cao, Xinru Zheng, Xiaotian Qiao, and Rynson W.H. Lau. *Content-aware generative modeling of graphic design layouts*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (Proc. of SIGGRAPH), 38, 2019.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a clear and organized presentation of the datasets used in the research.
