To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Constrained Deformable Convolutional Network for Efficient Single Image Dynamic Scene Blind Deblurring with Spatially-Variant Motion Blur Kernels Estimation" by Shu Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and datasets used in the study.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenges of single image dynamic scene blind deblurring and refer to the use of datasets for training and testing their model. However, I need to locate the specific names of the datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically subsection A titled "The Datasets and Implementation Details." Here, the authors explicitly state the datasets used for training and testing their model. They mention:

1. **GOPRO Dataset**: This dataset is used for training, consisting of 2103 image pairs for training and 1111 pairs for testing.
2. **HIDE Dataset**: This dataset is used for testing, containing 2025 pairs.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **GOPRO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Nah, T. H. Kim, and K. M. Lee. "Deep multi-scale convolutional neural network for dynamic scene deblurring." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2017, pp. 3883â€“3891.

- For the **HIDE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Z. Shen, W. Wang, J. Shen, H. Ling, T. Xu, and L. Shao. "Human-aware motion deblurring." In IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation for proper referencing. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
