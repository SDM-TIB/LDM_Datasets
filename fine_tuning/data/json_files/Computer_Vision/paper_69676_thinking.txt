To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic Textual Similarity Assessment in Chest X-ray Reports Using a Domain-Specific Cosine-Based Metric" by Sayeh Gholipour Picha et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and validation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of semantic similarity in medical reports, which suggests that datasets related to chest X-ray reports may be involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference several studies and datasets, including the **MIMIC-CXR dataset** and the **RadGraph dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are relevant to their research.

Next, I will look into the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their clinical entity extraction process and mention the **RadGraph dataset** as a resource for validating their entity extraction method. They state that this dataset contains radiologist-annotated clinical entities in chest X-ray reports.

In the **validation section**, the authors discuss the **MIMIC-CXR dataset** in detail, explaining how it is used to validate their domain similarity scoring method. They provide information about the dataset's contents, including chest X-ray images and corresponding reports.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **MIMIC-CXR Dataset**:
   > Johnson, A. E. W., Pollard, T. J., Berkowitz, S. J., Greenbaum, N. R., Lungren, M. P., Deng, C.-y., Mark, R. G., & Horng, S. (2019). MIMIC-CXR, a de-identified publicly available database of chest radiographs with free-text reports. *Scientific Data*, 6(1), 317. doi:10.1038/s41597-019-0322-0. URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-019-0322-0.

2. **RadGraph Dataset**:
   > Jain, S., Agrawal, A., Saporta, A., Truong, S., Duong, D. N., Bui, T., Chambon, P., Zhang, Y., Lungren, M. P., Ng, A. Y., Langlotz, C. P., & Rajpurkar, P. (2021). RadGraph: Extracting clinical entities and relations from radiology reports. In *Thirty-fifth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track (Round 1)*. URL: https://openreview.net/forum?id=pMWtc5NKd7V.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I accurately represent each dataset's details and citations in the required format for further processing or review. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and ensure that all relevant datasets are documented properly.
