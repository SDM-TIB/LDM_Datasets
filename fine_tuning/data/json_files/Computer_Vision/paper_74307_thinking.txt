To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Depth Anything V2" by Lihe Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the construction of a versatile evaluation benchmark with precise annotations and diverse scenes, indicating that datasets are likely discussed in detail.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Depth Anything V2)**, where the authors describe their training process. They mention using **five precise synthetic datasets** and **eight large-scale pseudo-labeled real datasets**. This section is crucial as it likely contains the names and details of the datasets used.

In **Table 7**, the authors list the synthetic datasets used for training the teacher model. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **BlendedMVS**: A large-scale dataset for generalized multi-view stereo networks.
2. **Hypersim**: A photorealistic synthetic dataset for holistic indoor scene understanding.
3. **IRS**: A large naturalistic indoor robotics stereo dataset.
4. **TartanAir**: A dataset designed to push the limits of visual SLAM.
5. **VKITTI 2**: A synthetic dataset for depth estimation.

For the **pseudo-labeled real datasets**, the authors mention:

1. **BDD100K**: A diverse driving dataset for heterogeneous multitask learning.
2. **Google Landmarks**: A large-scale benchmark for instance-level recognition and retrieval.
3. **ImageNet-21K**: A large-scale visual recognition challenge dataset.
4. **LSUN**: A dataset constructed using deep learning with human input.
5. **Objects365**: A large-scale dataset for object detection.
6. **Open Images V7**: A dataset for image classification and object detection.
7. **Places365**: A dataset for scene recognition.
8. **SA-1B**: A dataset for semantic segmentation.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation.

This structured approach will help me extract the datasets effectively while maintaining the integrity of the information presented in the paper.
