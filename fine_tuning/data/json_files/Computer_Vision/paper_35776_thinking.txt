To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving the Improved Training of Wasserstein GANs: A Consistency Term and Its Dual Effect" by Xiang Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The authors reference achieving state-of-the-art results on the **CIFAR-10 dataset** and the **MNIST dataset**, which indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about the datasets. Here, the authors mention the CIFAR-10 dataset and the MNIST dataset again, confirming their significance in the study.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will look for specific mentions of how these datasets were utilized. In the **3.1 MNIST** subsection, the authors describe the MNIST dataset as providing 70,000 handwritten digits, with 10,000 reserved for testing. They specify using 1,000 images for training in their experiments. This detailed description is crucial for understanding the dataset's application.

In the **3.2 CIFAR-10** subsection, the authors describe the CIFAR-10 dataset as containing 50,000 natural images of size 32x32. They mention using only 1,000 images for training in one of their models, which is important for replicating their results.

After gathering this information, I will check the **References section** for the full citations of these datasets:

1. For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

2. For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations for proper attribution.
