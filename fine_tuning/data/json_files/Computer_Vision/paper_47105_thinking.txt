To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Channel State Information for Physical Tamper Attack Detection in OFDM Systems: A Deep Learning Approach" by Eshagh Dehmollaian et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a deep learning approach for detecting physical tamper attacks using channel state information (CSI), but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the need for tamper detection in wireless networks but does not specify any datasets used for training or evaluation.

I will then look into the **experimental results section**. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup and mention that they collected a measurement set of **40,000 CSI observations** for training the deep convolutional autoencoder (DCAE). However, they do not refer to this as a formal dataset with a specific name.

Since the paper does not provide any named datasets, I will check the **References section** for any cited works that may have datasets related to the study. The references include several papers, but they primarily discuss methodologies and do not explicitly mention datasets.

The references that could potentially relate to datasets are:

1. I. E. Bagci et al., “Using Channel State Information for Tamper Detection in the Internet of Things,” in Proc. Computer Security Applications Conf. (ACSAC), New York, USA, pp. 131–140, Association for Computing Machinery, Dec. 2015.
2. X. Wang et al., “CSI-Based Fingerprinting for Indoor Localization: A Deep Learning Approach,” IEEE Trans. Veh. Technol., vol. 66, pp. 763–776, Mar. 2017.

However, these references do not provide specific datasets either.

In conclusion, while the paper discusses the use of channel state information for tamper detection and mentions the collection of CSI observations, it does not provide formal datasets with specific names or citations. Therefore, I will note that no formal datasets were extracted from this paper, and I will document the relevant references for context.

Now, I will summarize my findings and prepare to present them in the required format, ensuring to include the citations for the references that were mentioned.
