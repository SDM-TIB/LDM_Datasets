To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Pick at Non-Zero-Velocity from Interactive Demonstrations" by Anna Mészáros et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and validation experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any datasets used for their experiments or comparisons. This section often outlines the background and significance of the work, which may include mentions of existing datasets.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any specific datasets that were used for training or testing the robot's learning framework. This section typically details the experimental setup and may include information about the datasets, such as their names, sizes, and characteristics.

The **validation experiments section** is crucial as it often discusses the datasets used for evaluating the proposed methods. I will check for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets or their performance metrics.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

For this paper, I anticipate that the authors may have used datasets related to robotic manipulation tasks or human demonstrations. I will look for any specific names or references to datasets like the "Franka-Emika Panda" or any other datasets that might be relevant to the experiments described.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as per the requirements. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, along with proper attribution to the original sources.
