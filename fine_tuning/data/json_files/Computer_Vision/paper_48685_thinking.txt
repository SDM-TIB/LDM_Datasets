To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inverting Adversarially Robust Networks for Image Synthesis" by Renan A. Rojas-Gomez et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of adversarially robust representations and mentions applications like style transfer and image denoising, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets or references to datasets that are commonly used in the field of image synthesis or deep learning.

In Section 5.1, the authors mention evaluating their model on **ImageNet** and **CIFAR-10** datasets. These are well-known datasets in the computer vision community, and I will note them down.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
> Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., et al. (2015). *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3), 211-252.

For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
> Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G. E., et al. (2009). *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations as extracted from the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
