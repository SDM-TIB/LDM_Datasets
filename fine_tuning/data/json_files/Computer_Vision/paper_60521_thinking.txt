To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identifying Stochasticity in Time-Series with Autoencoder-Based Content-Aware 2D Representation: Application to Black Hole Data" by Chakka Sai Pradeep and Neelam Sinha, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their methodology on publicly available astronomical data related to black holes, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the black hole source GRS 1915 + 105 and mention that they are using 12 distinct temporal classes of time-series data. This is a strong indication that specific datasets are being utilized.

In the **dataset section (Section 3)**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used in their study. They state that they trained their autoencoders on **synthetically generated time-series data** (including Lorenz, logistic maps, white noise, and colored noise) and evaluated their model on **publicly available RXTE satellite data** for the black hole source GRS 1915 + 105. They provide details about the length of the time-series data and the number of temporal classes.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **RXTE satellite data**, the citation is:
   > "RXTE Public Data." NASA's High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center (HEASARC). Available at: https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xte/xtepublic.html.

2. For the **synthetic time-series data** (Lorenz, logistic maps, white noise, and colored noise), since these are generated data types and not from a specific publication, I will note that they are commonly used in time-series analysis but do not have a formal citation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the RXTE satellite data and noting the synthetic datasets appropriately.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
