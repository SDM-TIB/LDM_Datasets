To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DiffGCN: Graph Convolutional Networks via Differential Operators and Algebraic Multigrid Pooling" by Moshe Eliasof and Eran Treister, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and the introduction often highlights the significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the effectiveness of their proposed method and mention that they validate it through various experiments. This suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **ModelNet40**: This dataset includes 12,311 CAD meshes across 40 different categories, with a training split of 9,843 and a testing split of 2,468.

2. **ShapeNet Parts**: This dataset consists of 16,881 3D shapes across 16 different categories, with a total of 50 part annotation classes.

3. **S3DIS (Stanford Large-Scale 3D Indoor Spaces Dataset)**: This dataset contains 3D scans of 272 rooms from 6 different areas, with each point annotated with one of 13 semantic classes.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **ModelNet40**, the citation is:
  > Zhirong Wu, Shuran Song, Aditya Khosla, Fisher Yu, Linguang Zhang, Xiaoou Tang, and Jianxiong Xiao. *3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 1912–1920, 2015.

- For **ShapeNet Parts**, the citation is:
  > Li Yi, Vladimir G Kim, Duygu Ceylan, I-Chao Shen, Mengyan Yan, Hao Su, Cewu Lu, Qixing Huang, Alla Sheffer, and Leonidas Guibas. *A Scalable Active Framework for Region Annotation in 3D Shape Collections*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 35(6):1–12, 2016.

- For **S3DIS**, the citation is:
  > Iro Armeni, Ozan Sener, Amir R Zamir, Helen Jiang, Ioannis Brilakis, Martin Fischer, and Silvio Savarese. *3D Semantic Parsing of Large-Scale Indoor Spaces*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 1534–1543, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research.
