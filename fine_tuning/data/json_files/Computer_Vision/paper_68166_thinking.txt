To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MIVC: Multiple Instance Visual Component for Visual-Language Models" by Wenyi Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their method on a "publicly available e-commerce dataset with multiple images per product," which suggests that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Experiment and Analysis)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they refer to the **Amazon Berkeley Objects Dataset (ABO)**, which contains 147,702 products, each represented by multiple images and textual metadata. This section provides a detailed description of the dataset, including the number of images per product and the types of textual metadata included.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Amazon Berkeley Objects Dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> Jasmine Collins, Shubham Goel, Kenan Deng, Achleshwar Luthra, Leon Xu, Erhan Gundogdu, Xi Zhang, Tomas F Yago Vicente, Thomas Dideriksen, Himanshu Arora, et al. *ABO: Dataset and benchmarks for real-world 3D object understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 21126â€“21136, 2022.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Amazon Berkeley Objects Dataset, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured and formatted according to the specified requirements.
