To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EfficientFCN: Holistically-guided Decoding for Semantic Segmentation" by Jianbo Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is validated on **PASCAL Context, PASCAL VOC, and ADE20K**, indicating that these are the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4, the authors describe their experiments and explicitly state that they conducted evaluations on the following datasets:

1. **PASCAL Context**: This dataset consists of 4,998 training images and 5,105 testing images for scene parsing, which includes 59 foreground classes and one background class.

2. **PASCAL VOC 2012**: This dataset includes 1,464 images for training, 1,449 for validation, and 1,456 for testing, with 20 foreground objects and one background class.

3. **ADE20K**: This dataset comprises 20,000 images for training, 2,000 for validation, and 3,000 for testing, featuring 150 labeled classes.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **PASCAL Context**, the citation is:
  > Mottaghi, R., Chen, X., Liu, X., Cho, N.G., Lee, S.W., Fidler, S., Urtasun, R., & Yuille, A. (2014). *The role of context for object detection and semantic segmentation in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 891–898.

- For **PASCAL VOC 2012**, the citation is:
  > Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C.K., Winn, J., & Zisserman, A. (2010). *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2), 303–338.

- For **ADE20K**, the citation is:
  > Zhou, B., Zhao, H., Puig, X., Fidler, S., Barriuso, A., & Torralba, A. (2017). *Scene parsing through ADE20K dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 633–641.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
