To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contextual Residual Aggregation for Ultra High-Resolution Image Inpainting" by Zili Yi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of high-resolution image inpainting and hints at the use of datasets for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section (Section 4)**, where the authors typically provide details about the datasets used for training and testing their model. In this section, the authors explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Places2**: This dataset is referenced as a large-scale dataset used for scene recognition and is crucial for training the inpainting model.

2. **CelebA-HQ**: This dataset is noted for its high-quality images of celebrity faces, which are used to evaluate the inpainting performance on human subjects.

3. **DIV2K**: This dataset is mentioned as a benchmark for image super-resolution, which is relevant for the inpainting task.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Places2**, the citation is:
  > Zhou, B., Lapedriza, A., Khosla, A., Oliva, A., & Torralba, A. (2017). Places: A 10 million image database for scene recognition. *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*, 40(6), 1452-1464.

- For **CelebA-HQ**, the citation is:
  > Karras, T., Aila, T., Laine, S., & Lehtinen, J. (2017). Progressive growing of gans for improved quality, stability, and variation. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.10196*.

- For **DIV2K**, the citation is:
  > Timofte, R., Gu, S., Wu, J., Van Gool, L., Zhang, L., Yang, M.H., Haris, M., et al. (2018). NTIRE 2018 challenge on single image super-resolution: Methods and results. In *The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) Workshops*.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the representation of each dataset's significance and source.
