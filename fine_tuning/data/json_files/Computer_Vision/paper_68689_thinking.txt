To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RoHM: Robust Human Motion Reconstruction via Diffusion" by Siwei Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three popular datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will navigate to **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In this section, they list three datasets:

1. **AMASS**: This is described as a large-scale motion capture dataset that collects high-quality 3D human pose and shape annotations. The authors mention using the official SMPL-X neutral body annotations for training and evaluation.

2. **PROX**: This dataset collects monocular RGB-D videos of people interacting with various 3D indoor scenes. The authors note that it does not provide ground-truth annotations, but they use a subset of sequences to evaluate physical plausibility.

3. **EgoBody**: This dataset captures sequences of people interacting in various 3D indoor environments, providing ground-truth SMPL/SMPL-X annotations. The authors specifically mention using third-person RGB sequences exhibiting severe human-scene occlusions for evaluation.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **AMASS**, the citation is:
  > Naureen Mahmood, Nima Ghorbani, Nikolaus F. Troje, Gerard Pons-Moll, and Michael J. Black. *AMASS: Archive of motion capture as surface shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019.

- For **PROX**, the citation is:
  > Mohamed Hassan, Vasileios Choutas, Dimitrios Tzionas, and Michael J. Black. *Resolving 3D human pose ambiguities with 3D scene constraints*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019.

- For **EgoBody**, the citation is:
  > Siwei Zhang, Qianli Ma, Yan Zhang, Zhiyin Qian, Taein Kwon, Marc Pollefeys, Federica Bogo, and Siyu Tang. *EgoBody: Human body shape and motion of interacting people from head-mounted devices*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2022.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
