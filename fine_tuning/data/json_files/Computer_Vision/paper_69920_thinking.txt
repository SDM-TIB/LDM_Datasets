To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Failure Cases in Multimodal Reasoning About Physical Dynamics" by Sadaf Ghaffari and Nikhil Krishnaswamy, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but I need to look for specific dataset names or descriptions in the main body of the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges faced by large language models (LLMs) in physical reasoning, but they do not mention any datasets directly. I will continue to the methodology and experiments sections for more detailed information.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the construction of a simulation environment and the types of objects used in their experiments. They mention using a specific platform called **VoxWorld** for their simulations, which indicates that the environment itself may be a dataset or a framework for generating data.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** to see if they reference any datasets used for training or evaluation. They discuss the evaluation of LLM outputs in terms of stability and correctness, but again, there are no explicit dataset names mentioned.

I will also look at the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited in the context of previous work or related studies. This could provide insights into datasets that are relevant to their research.

After reviewing the paper, I find that while the authors do not explicitly name any datasets, they reference the **VoxWorld platform** and its associated data generation capabilities. Therefore, I will treat VoxWorld as a dataset for the purpose of this extraction.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into full citations for the relevant datasets:

1. **VoxWorld**: 
   > Krishnaswamy, N., Pickard, W., Cates, B., Blanchard, N., & Pustejovsky, J. (2022). The VoxWorld platform for multimodal embodied agents. In LREC proceedings, volume 13.

Since the paper does not provide additional datasets, I will conclude my extraction here. I will ensure that the citation is formatted correctly and ready for inclusion in any further documentation or analysis.
