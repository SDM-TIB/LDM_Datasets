To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Modal Cross-Domain Alignment Network for Video Moment Retrieval" by Xiang Fang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on three challenging benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention:

1. **ActivityNet Captions**: This dataset consists of 20,000 untrimmed videos with 100,000 queries from YouTube, focusing on open-domain activities. The average video length is about 117.61 seconds, with an average query length of 14.78 words.

2. **Charades-STA**: This dataset contains 6,672 videos and is centered around indoor activities. It has 16,128 annotations, with an average video length of 30.59 seconds and an average query length of 7.22 words.

3. **TACoS**: This dataset includes 127 cooking-related videos, with 18,818 annotations. The average video length is 287.14 seconds, and the average query length is 10.05 words.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **ActivityNet Captions**:
  > A. Krishnan, K. Hata, F. Ren, L. Fei-Fei, and J. C. Niebles. *Dense-captioning events in videos*. In ICCV, 2017, pp. 706–715.

- For **Charades-STA**:
  > G. A. Sigurdsson, G. Varol, X. Wang, A. Farhadi, I. Laptev, and A. Gupta. *Hollywood in homes: Crowdsourcing data collection for activity understanding*. In ECCV, 2016, pp. 510–526.

- For **TACoS**:
  > M. Regneri, M. Rohrbach, D. Wetzel, S. Thater, B. Schiele, and M. Pinkal. *Grounding action descriptions in videos*. TACL, vol. 1, pp. 25–36, 2013.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
