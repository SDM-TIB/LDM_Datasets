To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Active Learning of Neural Collision Handler for Complex 3D Mesh Deformations" by Qingyang Tan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on several datasets corresponding to different shapes and topologies, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments** section, particularly the part where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. In this section, they explicitly list five datasets used for their experiments:

1. **SCAPE Dataset**: This dataset consists of 71 meshes, each having 2161 vertices, and is used for human body shape completion and animation.
2. **MIT Swing Dataset**: This dataset contains 150 meshes, each with 9971 vertices, and is used for simulating swinging motions.
3. **MIT Jump Dataset**: Similar to the Swing dataset, this one also has 150 meshes with 10002 vertices, used for jumping actions.
4. **Skirt Dataset**: Introduced by Yang et al. (2020), this dataset includes 201 simulated skirt meshes, each with 2830 vertices, and is used for cloth simulation.
5. **Hand Dataset**: This custom dataset consists of various hand poses captured using a multi-view capture system, resulting in 7314 meshes with 2825 vertices each.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

- For the **SCAPE Dataset**:

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
