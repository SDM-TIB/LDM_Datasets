To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Bayesian Data Augmentation Approach for Learning Deep Models" by Toan Tran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method on **MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets**, indicating that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will delve into the **experiments section** to gather more details about how these datasets were utilized. The authors specify that they conducted experiments on **MNIST**, which contains 60,000 training and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits, **CIFAR-10**, consisting of 50,000 training and 10,000 testing images across 10 classes, and **CIFAR-100**, which has the same number of training and testing samples as CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **MNIST**, the citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

2. For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

3. For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is the same as CIFAR-10 since it is derived from the same dataset:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help in organizing the datasets for further analysis or processing.
