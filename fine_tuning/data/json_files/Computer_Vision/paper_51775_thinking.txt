To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simpler is Better: Spectral Regularization and Up-Sampling Techniques for Variational Autoencoders" by Sara Björk et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference the **CelebA dataset** as an example of a dataset used in their work. This is a good starting point, but I need to confirm the details in the methodology and experiments sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Shape Dataset**: A simple gray-scale dataset analyzed at a resolution of 32x32. The authors cite Jing et al. (2020) for this dataset.
   
2. **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits, also analyzed at a resolution of 32x32. The citation for this dataset is LeCun et al. (1998).

3. **CelebA Dataset**: An RGB dataset of celebrity faces analyzed at a resolution of 64x64. The citation for this dataset is Liu et al. (2015).

Now, I will check the **References section** to ensure I have the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Shape Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li Jing, Jure Zbontar, and Yann LeCun. *Implicit Rank-Minimizing Autoencoder*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, vol. 33, 2020.

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 86, no. 11, pp. 2278–2324, 1998.

- For the **CelebA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2015, pp. 3730–3738.

With these citations confirmed, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
