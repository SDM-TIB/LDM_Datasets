To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uplift Modeling based on Graph Neural Network Combined with Causal Knowledge" by Haowen Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses uplift modeling and mentions the use of both synthetic and real-world datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their study. In this section, they mention:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: The authors state that they used a method to simulate a dataset containing individual treatment effects, which is available in the CausalML library. They reference Chen et al. [4] for the generation mechanism, indicating that this synthetic dataset is based on a specific methodology.

2. **Criteo Uplift Dataset**: This real-world dataset is described as being constructed from incremental tests, with 25 million rows and 11 characteristics per user. The authors specify that this dataset is used for evaluating uplift modeling.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **CausalML synthetic dataset**, the citation is:
  > Huigang Chen, Totte Harinen, Jeong-Yoon Lee, Mike Yung, and Zhenyu Zhao. *Causalml: Python package for causal machine learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2002.11631, 2020.

- For the **Criteo Uplift Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Eustache Diemert, Artem Betlei, Christophe Renaudin, and Massih-Reza Amini. *A large scale benchmark for uplift modeling*. In Proceedings of the KDD, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
