To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CogMol: Target-Specific and Selective Drug Design for COVID-19 Using Deep Generative Models" by Vijil Chenthamarakshan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a framework for designing drug-like small molecules, which suggests that datasets related to molecular structures or binding affinities may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, specifically looking for any subsections that detail the datasets used for training or evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using the **Moses benchmarking dataset** for unsupervised training, which includes 1.6 million molecules, and the **BindingDB** for target-specific compound design, which contains curated IC50-labeled compound-protein binding data.

I will also check the **Results section** for any additional datasets that may have been used for validation or comparison. The authors discuss the performance of their model on various targets, indicating that they generated molecules for three SARS-CoV-2 target proteins and human HDAC1, but they do not introduce new datasets here.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Moses Benchmarking Dataset**:
   - Citation: 
     > Polykovskiy, D., Zhebrak, A., Sanchez-Lengeling, B., Golovanov, A., Tatanov, O., Belyaev, S., Kurbanov, R., Artamonov, A., Aladinskiy, V., Veselov, M., Kadurin, A., Nikolenko, S., Aspuru-Guzik, A., & Zhavoronkov, A. (2018). *Molecular sets (MOSES): A benchmarking platform for molecular generation models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.12823.

2. **BindingDB**:
   - Citation:
     > Gilson, M. K., Liu, T., Baitaluk, M., Nicola, G., Hwang, L., & Chong, J. (2015). *BindingDB in 2015: a public database for medicinal chemistry, computational chemistry and systems pharmacology*. Nucleic Acids Research, 44(D1), D1045-D1053.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the relevant details, including the purpose of each dataset and how they were utilized in the study. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research in the field.
