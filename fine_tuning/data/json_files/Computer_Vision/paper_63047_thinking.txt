To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fashion Matrix: Editing Photos by Just Talking" by Zheng Chong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the Fashion Matrix system and its capabilities but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the integration of various models and systems. While they mention several models and frameworks, there are no specific datasets mentioned yet. I will continue to the **experiments section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of evaluating the Fashion Matrix.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any references to datasets used for training or testing the Fashion Matrix. If the authors mention any datasets, I will take note of their names, descriptions, and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will also consider looking for any supplementary materials or appendices that might contain additional information about datasets used in the research.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and experiments sections to identify any datasets.
2. Take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names and descriptions.
3. Check the References section for full citations of the identified datasets.
4. Compile the information into a structured format for clarity and accessibility.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all relevant datasets from the paper.
