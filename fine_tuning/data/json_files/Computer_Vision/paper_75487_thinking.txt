To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mutual Learning for Acoustic Matching and Dereverberation via Visual Scene-driven Diffusion" by Jian Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, particularly the subsections that discuss the datasets used. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **SoundSpaces-Speech**: This dataset is described as employing a simulated environment to generate reverberation audio, with perfectly aligned paired audio and accurate ground truth. The dataset is split into train, validation, and test sets with specific sample counts.

2. **Acoustic AVSpeech**: This dataset is a subset of the AVSpeech dataset and is noted for its realism but presents challenges due to the lack of corresponding reverberant audios. It contains a large number of video clips for training, validation, and testing.

To confirm the details and obtain the full citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **SoundSpaces-Speech**, the citation is:
  > Chen, C., Gao, R., Calamia, P., & Grauman, K. (2022). Visual acoustic matching. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For **AVSpeech**, the citation is:
  > Ephrat, A., Mosseri, I., Lang, O., Dekel, T., Wilson, K., Hassidim, A., Freeman, W.T., & Rubinstein, M. (2018). Looking to listen at the cocktail party: A speaker-independent audio-visual model for speech separation. In Proceedings of the ACM SIGGRAPH.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their full citations.
