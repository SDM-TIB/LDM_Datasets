To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "qMRI Diffusor: Quantitative T1 Mapping of the Brain using a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model" by Shishuai Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for quantitative MRI and the challenges associated with it. They mention the use of synthetic datasets and real scan data, which indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, particularly the subsection titled **3.2 Datasets**. Here, the authors describe the datasets used in their study:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset was synthesized following the methods described in reference [17]. It consists of paired quantitative maps and weighted images, generated from 994 geometrically different axial slices drawn from 14 brain models provided by BrainWeb. The dataset includes 3976 slices in total.

2. **Testing Dataset**: The testing dataset includes data acquired from:
   - A quantitative NIST/ISMRM phantom (CaliberMRI, Boulder, CO, USA).
   - A healthy volunteer, with ethical approval and informed consent obtained.

Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **BrainWeb** dataset, the citation is:
  > Cocosco, C.A. "Brainweb: Online interface to a 3D MRI simulated brain database." NeuroImage, p. 425, 1997.

- For the **NIST/ISMRM phantom**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the text, but I will note that it is from CaliberMRI, Boulder, CO, USA.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented for future reference or analysis.
