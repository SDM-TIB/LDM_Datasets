To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-time Inflation Forecasting Using Non-linear Dimension Reduction Techniques" by Niko Hauzenberger, Florian Huber, and Karin Klieber, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors use a **monthly US dataset** from the **FRED-MD database** for their forecasting application, which is a key dataset to note.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **data overview section** (Section 4.1). Here, the authors describe the **FRED-MD database** as containing 105 monthly variables spanning from January 1963 to January 2021. This is a significant dataset for their analysis.

In the **data appendix**, the authors provide further details about the variables included in their analysis, categorizing them into slow-moving and fast-moving variables. This section lists specific FRED mnemonics for each variable, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The primary dataset is:

- **FRED-MD Database**: 
  > McCracken, M. W., & Ng, S. (2016). FRED-MD: A monthly database for macroeconomic research. *Journal of Business & Economic Statistics*, 34(4), 574-589.

Additionally, the paper references various variables from the FRED database, which are essential for their analysis. I will note the specific variables mentioned, such as **CPIAUCSL** (Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers), **HOUST** (Housing Starts), and others, as they are part of the dataset used for forecasting.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
