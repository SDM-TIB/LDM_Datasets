To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EGSDE: Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation via Energy-Guided Stochastic Differential Equations" by Min Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their method on two datasets: **AFHQ** and **CelebA-HQ**. This is a good starting point.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors provide more details about the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **CelebA-HQ**: This dataset contains high-quality face images and is divided into two domains: male and female, with 1000 testing images per category.
2. **AFHQ**: This dataset consists of high-resolution animal face images across three domains: cat, dog, and wild, with 500 testing images in each domain.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **CelebA-HQ**, the citation is:
  > Tero Karras, Timo Aila, Samuli Laine, and Jaakko Lehtinen. *Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability, and Variation*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2018.

- For **AFHQ**, the citation is:
  > Yunjey Choi, Youngjung Uh, Jaejun Yoo, and Jung-Woo Ha. *Stargan v2: Diverse Image Synthesis for Multiple Domains*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 8188–8197, 2020.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: CelebA-HQ
   - **Description**: Contains high-quality face images, separated into male and female domains, with 1000 testing images per category.
   - **Citation**: Tero Karras, Timo Aila, Samuli Laine, and Jaakko Lehtinen. *Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability, and Variation*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2018.

2. **Dataset Name**: AFHQ
   - **Description**: Comprises high-resolution animal face images across three domains: cat, dog, and wild, with 500 testing images in each domain.
   - **Citation**: Yunjey Choi, Youngjung Uh, Jaejun Yoo, and Jung-Woo Ha. *Stargan v2: Diverse Image Synthesis for Multiple Domains*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 8188–8197, 2020.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
