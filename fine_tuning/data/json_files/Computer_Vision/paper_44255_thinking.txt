To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Channel-Wise Autoregressive Entropy Models for Learned Image Compression" by David Minnen and Saurabh Singh, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions empirical results on the **Kodak image set** and the **Tecnick image set**, indicating that these are datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 5, the authors provide a comparison of their model's performance on the **Kodak image set** and mention the **Tecnick image set** as well. They state that their model achieves significant rate savings on both datasets, which confirms their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The Kodak image set is referenced as follows:
- **Kodak image set**: 
  > Kodak, Kodak lossless true color image suite (PhotoCD PCD0992). [Online]. Available: http://r0k.us/graphics/kodak/.

For the **Tecnick image set**, the citation is:
- **Tecnick image set**: 
  > N. Asuni and A. Giachetti, “TESTIMAGES: A large-scale archive for testing visual devices and basic image processing algorithms (SAMPLING 1200 RGB set),” in STAG: Smart Tools and Apps for Graphics, 2014. [Online]. Available: https://sourceforge.net/projects/testimages/files/OLD/OLD_SAMPLING/testimages.zip.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Kodak image set**: This dataset is used for evaluating image compression methods and is known for its high-quality images.
2. **Tecnick image set**: This dataset is utilized for testing visual devices and image processing algorithms, providing a diverse set of images.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or processing.
