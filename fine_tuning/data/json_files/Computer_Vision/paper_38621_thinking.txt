To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CNN based Multi-Instance Multi-Task Learning for Syndrome Differentiation of Diabetic Patients" by Zeyuan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets or data sources that the authors might have utilized. This section often discusses the background and significance of the research, which may include mentions of specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly subsection A, which is titled "Dataset of Diabetes in TCM." Here, the authors describe the dataset in detail, including its origin, structure, and the specific records it contains. They mention that the dataset comes from the Guangâ€™anmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, and consists of 1915 outpatient records with various annotations related to symptoms, syndromes, herbal prescriptions, and treatment outcomes.

The authors also specify the inclusion criteria for the dataset, which helps clarify the dataset's composition. They provide a comprehensive overview of the symptoms and syndromes included in the dataset, which is crucial for understanding its application in their study.

After identifying the dataset, I will check the **references section** for the full citation of the dataset. The authors reference previous works that may have utilized or described the dataset, which can provide authoritative citations.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Poon, S.K., Poon, J., McGrane, M., Zhou, X., Kwan, P., Zhang, R., Liu, B., Gao, J., Loy, C., Chan, K., and Man-yuen Sze, D. (2011). A novel approach in discovering significant interactions from TCM patient prescription data. *International Journal of Data Mining and Bioinformatics*, 5(4), pp. 353-368.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that the dataset's name, description, and citation are clearly articulated.
