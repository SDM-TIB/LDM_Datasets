To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Particle physics DL-simulation with control over generated data properties" by Karol Rogoziński et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the research involves simulations related to particle physics, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of simulations for the Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) in the ALICE experiment at CERN. They mention the need for efficient simulation methods, which may lead to the identification of datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **method section**, where the authors describe their approach using the CorrVAE model. They mention using a dataset described in reference [22], which includes nearly 300,000 simulated responses generated by classical Monte Carlo methods. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will extract the details of this dataset:
- **Dataset Name**: The dataset is not explicitly named in the text, but it is referred to as the dataset used for generating calorimeter responses based on classical Monte Carlo methods.
- **Description**: It contains nearly 300,000 simulated responses, each with a dimension of 44x44, and includes nine properties for each particle: momentum and velocity in three planes, mass, charge, and energy.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned in reference [22]. The citation is:
> Dubiński, J., Deja, K., Wenzel, S., Rokita, P., and Trzciński, T. *Machine learning methods for simulating particle response in the Zero Degree Calorimeter at the ALICE experiment, CERN*. Technical report, 2023. URL https://cds.cern.ch/record/2875960.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:
1. **Dataset Name**: Simulated responses dataset for ZDC calorimeter
2. **Description**: Contains nearly 300,000 simulated responses, each with dimensions of 44x44, including nine properties for each particle: momentum and velocity in three planes, mass, charge, and energy.
3. **Full Citation**: Dubiński, J., Deja, K., Wenzel, S., Rokita, P., and Trzciński, T. *Machine learning methods for simulating particle response in the Zero Degree Calorimeter at the ALICE experiment, CERN*. Technical report, 2023. URL https://cds.cern.ch/record/2875960.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all dataset details and citations are accurately captured.
