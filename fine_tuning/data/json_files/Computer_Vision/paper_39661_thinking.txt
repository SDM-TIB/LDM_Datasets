To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A new definition of artificial neuron" by Adriano Baldeschi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their new neuron architecture on the **MNIST dataset** and the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. This is a good starting point, as it explicitly names the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Data analysis)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. Here, they confirm that:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits. It is widely used for training image processing systems.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images across 10 classes. It is also a standard benchmark in image classification tasks.

Both datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper, and their mention in the data analysis section confirms their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

With this information, I have successfully identified and documented the datasets used in the paper, along with their full citations. I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
