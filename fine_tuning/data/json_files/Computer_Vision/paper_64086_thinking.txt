To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gradient Domain Diffusion Models for Image Synthesis" by Yuanhao Gong, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract discusses the efficiency of diffusion models in image synthesis but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction elaborates on the applications of generative models but again does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section III), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing Section III, I find that the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets used for their experiments. Instead, they discuss the methodology and results of their proposed models without referencing specific datasets. This indicates that the paper may not rely on publicly available datasets or may be using synthetic data generated by their own methods.

Since no datasets are explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any cited works include datasets that could be relevant. I will look for papers that might describe datasets used in similar contexts or methodologies.

After reviewing the references, I find several citations that may relate to datasets in the field of image processing and generative models. However, none of these references explicitly mention datasets used in the experiments of this paper.

In conclusion, it appears that this paper does not provide specific datasets for extraction. Therefore, I will note that no datasets were identified in the paper "Gradient Domain Diffusion Models for Image Synthesis" by Yuanhao Gong, and I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none were mentioned.

If I were to summarize my findings, I would state that the paper focuses on a novel approach to diffusion models without referencing specific datasets, which limits the ability to extract dataset information.
