To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Investigating Language Impact in Bilingual Approaches for Computational Language Documentation" by Marcely Zanon Boito et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used the **MaSS multilingual speech corpus** for their experiments, which is a strong candidate for a dataset.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail, particularly the **experimental settings** section. Here, the authors mention using the **MaSS dataset** (Boito et al., 2020) for their experiments, which contains 8,130 sentences extracted from the Bible, providing multilingual speech and text alignment across several languages.

In the **experimental settings** section, I will note the details about the dataset, including the languages involved: English (EN), Spanish (ES), Basque (EU), Finnish (FI), French (FR), Hungarian (HU), Romanian (RO), and Russian (RU). The authors also mention that they down-sampled the corpus to 5,324 sentences to simulate a low-resource setting.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **MaSS dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Boito, M. Z., Havard, W. N., Garnerin, M., Ferrand, Ã‰. L., and Besacier, L. (2020). *MaSS: A large and clean multilingual corpus of sentence-aligned spoken utterances extracted from the Bible*. Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC).

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about the **MaSS dataset** and its citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry with the necessary details, ensuring that the citation is included in full to maintain academic integrity and provide proper attribution.
