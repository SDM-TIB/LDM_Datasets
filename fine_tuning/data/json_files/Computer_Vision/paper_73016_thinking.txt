To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Dynamic Data Sampler for Cross-Language Transfer Learning in Large Language Models" by Yudong Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors use a mix of Chinese, English, and parallel corpus for training their model, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **approach** section, particularly the subsection titled **2.2 Training Data**. Here, the authors provide a detailed description of the various data sources they utilized. I will note down the datasets mentioned, including their sizes and types.

The paper lists several datasets:
1. **CLUECorpus**: A large-scale Chinese corpus used for pre-training language models.
2. **WuDao**: A dataset that is part of the training data, specifically for Chinese language understanding.
3. **CSL**: Another large-scale Chinese scientific literature dataset.
4. **ParaCrawl v9**: A parallel corpus for bridging Chinese and English knowledge representation.
5. **WikiMatrix**: A dataset that provides parallel sentences in multiple languages.
6. **RefinedWeb**: An unsupervised English corpus used to balance the training distribution.
7. **BELLE**: An instruction dataset for enhancing interaction capabilities.
8. **UltraChat**: Another instruction dataset used in the training process.
9. **FLAN**: A supervised dataset that includes prompts for instruction learning.
10. **COIG**: A dataset that contributes to the instruction data.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and reproducibility.

The citations I will extract are:

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset used in the research.
