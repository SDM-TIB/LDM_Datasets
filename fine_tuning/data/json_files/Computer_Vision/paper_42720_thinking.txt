To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Permutation Invariant Convolution for Recognizing Long-range Activities" by Noureldien Hussein et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors study the effectiveness of their proposed method on several benchmarks, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Charades**: This dataset is described as a video dataset for multi-label action classification, containing 8,000 training videos, 1,200 validation videos, and 2,000 test videos. Each video has an average length of 30 seconds and includes 157 unit-action classes.

2. **Breakfast**: This dataset consists of 1,712 videos focused on unscripted cooking activities, with 1,357 videos for training and 335 for testing. Each video represents a single activity and has an average length of 2.3 minutes, with 10 categories of breakfast activities.

3. **MultiThumos**: This dataset is for untrimmed human activities in videos, containing 400 videos and 65 action classes. Each video can be thought of as a complex action comprising an average of 11 unit-actions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Charades**, the citation is:
  > Gunnar A Sigurdsson, Gül Varol, Xiaolong Wang, Ali Farhadi, Ivan Laptev, and Abhinav Gupta. *Hollywood in homes: Crowdsourcing data collection for activity understanding*. In ECCV, 2016.

- For **Breakfast**, the citation is:
  > Hilde Kuehne, Ali Arslan, and Thomas Serre. *The language of actions: Recovering the syntax and semantics of goal-directed human activities*. In CVPR, 2014.

- For **MultiThumos**, the citation is:
  > Haroon Idrees, Amir R Zamir, Yu-Gang Jiang, Alex Gorban, Ivan Laptev, Rahul Sukthankar, and Mubarak Shah. *The thumos challenge on action recognition for videos “in the wild”*. In CVIU, 2017.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
