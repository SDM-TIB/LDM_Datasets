To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Item Promotion on Visually-Aware Recommender Systems by Guided Diffusion" by Lijian Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two commonly used e-commerce recommendation datasets, specifically **Amazon Beauty** and **Amazon Baby**. This is a strong indication that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention the datasets in **section 5.1.1 (Dataset)**, where they describe the Amazon Beauty and Amazon Baby datasets in detail. They provide statistics about the number of users, items, and interactions, which confirms their relevance to the study.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **references section** of the paper. While the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, it does mention that they are derived from the Amazon website. Therefore, I will cite them as follows:

1. **Amazon Beauty Dataset**: 
   > Amazon Beauty. Retrieved from https://www.amazon.com/beauty

2. **Amazon Baby Dataset**: 
   > Amazon Baby. Retrieved from https://www.amazon.com/baby

Since these datasets are commonly known and publicly available, I will use the URLs as citations.

Finally, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that I follow the required format for clarity and completeness. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
