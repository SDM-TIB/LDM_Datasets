To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational Information Bottleneck on Vector Quantized Autoencoders" by Hanwei Wu and Markus Flierl, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the introduction and methodology sections, where datasets are more likely to be discussed in the context of experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. These sections typically provide detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. If the paper includes a dedicated section on datasets, I will focus on that as it will likely contain the most relevant information.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

If the paper does not provide explicit dataset names, I will look for any figures, tables, or supplementary materials that might list datasets or provide additional context about the data used in the experiments.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, making sure to include all relevant details for each dataset extracted from the paper.
