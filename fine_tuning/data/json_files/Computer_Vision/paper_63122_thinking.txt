To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning multi-modal representations by watching hundreds of surgical video lectures" by Kun Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets. The abstract mentions the creation of a **Surgical Video Lecture (SVL) dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe how they constructed the SVL dataset. They detail that the dataset consists of **1.4k procedural videos** sourced from various platforms, including **WebSurg**, **EAES**, and **YouTube**. This section provides crucial information about the dataset's size and the platforms used for data collection.

In the **experiments section**, the authors discuss how they utilized the SVL dataset for various tasks, confirming its role in their experiments. They also mention the use of **AWS Medical Transcribe** and **Whisper ASR systems** for generating text transcriptions from the videos, which further emphasizes the dataset's significance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the following:

1. **Surgical Video Lecture (SVL) dataset**: This dataset is described in detail in the paper, but it does not have a separate citation since it is a novel dataset created by the authors. However, I will note that it is derived from:
   - **WebSurg**: The online university of IRCAD, which can be cited as:
     > Websurg, 2023. Websurg, the online university of IRCAD. URL: https://websurg.com/en/.
   - **EAES**: The European Association of Endoscopic Surgery, which can be cited as:
     > EAES, 2023. The European Association of Endoscopic Surgery. URL: https://eaes.eu/.
   - **YouTube**: A widely known platform, which can be cited as:
     > YouTube, 2023. YouTube. URL: https://www.youtube.com/.

2. **AWS Medical Transcribe**: This is a service used for transcription, which can be cited as:
   > AWS, 2023. Amazon Transcribe Medical. URL: https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/medical/.

3. **Whisper ASR system**: This is referenced in the context of the authors' methodology but does not have a separate citation. However, it can be cited as:
   > Radford, A., Kim, J.W., Xu, T., et al., 2023. Robust speech recognition via large-scale weak supervision. In: International Conference on Machine Learning, PMLR.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset and relevant sources. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture the datasets and their citations from the paper.
