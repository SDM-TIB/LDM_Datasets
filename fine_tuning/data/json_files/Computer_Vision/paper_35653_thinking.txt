To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Context-Aware Single-Shot Detector" by Wei Xiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the experimental results show improvements on several datasets, which suggests that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 6) where the authors discuss their results. Here, they specifically mention using the **MS-COCO** and **DETRAC** datasets for evaluation. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets.

1. **MS-COCO Dataset**: The authors state that they compare their proposed method against SSD on the MS-COCO dataset, which is a well-known dataset for object detection. They mention using the trainval35k training set for their experiments.

2. **DETRAC Dataset**: The authors describe the DETRAC dataset as a challenging real-world vehicle detection dataset, consisting of 60 sequences for training and 40 for testing. They provide additional details about the dataset's characteristics, such as variations in vehicle categories and occlusion ratios.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MS-COCO**, the citation is:
  > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755. Springer, 2014.

- For **DETRAC**, the citation is:
  > L. Wen, D. Du, Z. Cai, Z. Lei, M. Chang, H. Qi, J. Lim, M. Yang, and S. Lyu. *DETRAC: A New Benchmark and Protocol for Multi-Object Detection and Tracking*. arXiv CoRR, abs/1511.04136, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation as required. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
