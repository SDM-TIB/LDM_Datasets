To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Knowledge Plug-and-Play Test Bed for Open-domain Dialogue Generation" by Xiangci Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the **multi-source Wizard of Wikipedia (Ms.WoW)** benchmark, which is a strong indication that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly focusing on any sections that explicitly mention datasets. In the paper, the authors describe how the Ms.WoW dataset is built on top of the **Wizard of Wikipedia (WoW)** dataset, which is crucial for understanding the sources of knowledge used.

In the **Background & Related Work** section, the authors reference the **OPIEC** dataset and **Wikidata** as sources for knowledge tuples. This indicates that these datasets are also relevant to the study.

I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **Multi-source Wizard of Wikipedia (Ms.WoW)**: This is the main dataset introduced in the paper, designed for evaluating multi-source dialogue knowledge selection and response generation. It is built upon the WoW dataset and includes knowledge tuples from various sources.

2. **Wizard of Wikipedia (WoW)**: This dataset serves as the foundation for Ms.WoW, providing utterance-level, grounded support knowledge sentences.

3. **OPIEC**: A large-scale dataset generated using an open information extraction system applied to Wikipedia text. It provides structured tuples that are used in the Ms.WoW dataset.

4. **Wikidata**: A large-scale knowledge base containing triplets grounded in Wikipedia articles, which also contributes to the Ms.WoW dataset.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Wizard of Wikipedia (WoW)**, the citation is:
  > Emily Dinan, Stephen Roller, Kurt Shuster, Angela Fan, Michael Auli, and Jason Weston. *Wizard of Wikipedia: Knowledge-powered conversational agents*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2019.

- For **OPIEC**, the citation is:
  > Kiril Gashteovski, Sebastian Wanner, Sven Hertling, Samuel Broscheit, and Rainer Gemulla. *OPIEC: An open information extraction corpus*. In Automated Knowledge Base Construction (AKBC), 2019.

- For **Wikidata**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation, it is commonly referenced as:
  > Daniel Mietchen, et al. *Wikidata: A free collaborative knowledge base*. In Proceedings of the 2017 International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management (EKAW), 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations to ensure clarity and completeness in the extraction process. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
