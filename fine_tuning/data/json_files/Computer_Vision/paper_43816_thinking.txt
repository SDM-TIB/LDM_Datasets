To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explaining Predictions by Approximating the Local Decision Boundary" by Georgios Vlassopoulos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a "new benchmark data set with artificially generated Iris images," which indicates that a dataset is introduced in the paper.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In the **experiments section**, I will focus on any subsections that explicitly mention datasets. For instance, the paper discusses the **AIris dataset**, which is described as containing simulated images of flowers generated based on specific parameters. This dataset is crucial for evaluating the explainability methods proposed in the paper.

I will also check for any other datasets mentioned, such as the **CelebA dataset**, which is referenced in the context of evaluating the proposed methods on real-world data. The CelebA dataset is noted for containing celebrity images annotated with various attributes.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **AIris dataset**, the citation is:
> Vlassopoulos, G., van Erven, T., Brighton, H., & Menkovski, V. (2020). *Explaining Predictions by Approximating the Local Decision Boundary*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.00001.

For the **CelebA dataset**, the citation is:
> Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while providing proper citations for future reference.
