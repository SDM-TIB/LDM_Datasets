To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A2-GCN: An Attribute-aware Attentive GCN Model for Recommendation" by Fan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on several publicly accessible datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In **Section 4.1.1 (Datasets)**, the authors list four datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Office Products**: This dataset includes user-item interactions and attributes related to office products.
2. **Clothing**: This dataset contains user-item interactions and attributes for clothing items.
3. **Toys Games**: This dataset consists of user-item interactions and attributes for toys and games.
4. **Kindle Store**: This dataset includes user-item interactions and attributes for Kindle products.

The authors provide basic statistics for each dataset, such as the number of users, items, interactions, and attributes, which helps in understanding the scale and nature of the datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that the datasets are derived from the Amazon review dataset, which is widely used in recommendation evaluation. The citation for the Amazon review dataset is:

- **Amazon Review Dataset**:
  > J. McAuley and J. Leskovec. "Hidden factors and hidden topics: understanding rating dimensions with review text." In Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems. ACM, 2013, pp. 165â€“172.

Since the datasets are specific categories from the Amazon review dataset, I will note that the citation for each dataset is essentially the same as the citation for the Amazon review dataset.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citation is included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
