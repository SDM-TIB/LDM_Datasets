To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ZegOT: Zero-shot Segmentation Through Optimal Transport of Text Prompts" by Kwanyoung Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **PASCAL VOC 2012**: This dataset is noted for its use in semantic segmentation tasks and consists of 10,582 training images and 1,449 validation images across 20 categories, divided into 15 seen and 5 unseen classes.

2. **PASCAL Context**: An extension of the PASCAL VOC dataset, it contains 4,996 training images and 5,104 test images with 60 categories, categorized into 50 seen and 10 unseen classes.

3. **COCO-Stuff164K**: A large-scale dataset with 118,287 training images and 5,000 validation images, containing 171 classes, divided into 156 seen and 15 unseen classes.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **PASCAL VOC 2012**, the citation is:
  > Everingham, M., & Winn, J. (2012). The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2012 (VOC2012) Development Kit. Pattern Anal. Stat. Model. Comput. Learn., Tech. Rep, 2007: 1–45.

- For **PASCAL Context**, the citation is:
  > Mottaghi, R., Chen, X., Liu, X., Cho, N.-G., Lee, S.-W., Fidler, S., Urtasun, R., & Yuille, A. (2014). The role of context for object detection and semantic segmentation in the wild. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 891–898.

- For **COCO-Stuff164K**, the citation is:
  > Caesar, H., Uijlings, J., & Ferrari, V. (2018). COCO-Stuff: Thing and stuff classes in context. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 1209–1218.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
