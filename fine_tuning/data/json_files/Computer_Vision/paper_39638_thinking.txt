To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Virtual Mixup Training for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation" by Xudong Mao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that they conducted extensive experiments on **six domain adaptation benchmark datasets**. This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the experiments section, the authors explicitly list the datasets they evaluated their method on. They mention the following datasets:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits, commonly used for training various image processing systems.
2. **MNIST-M**: A modified version of the MNIST dataset that includes images from different domains to challenge domain adaptation methods.
3. **Synthetic Digits (SYN)**: A dataset created by synthesizing digits to further test domain adaptation techniques.
4. **Street View House Numbers (SVHN)**: A real-world dataset containing images of house numbers from Google Street View, used for digit recognition.
5. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, widely used for machine learning and computer vision tasks.
6. **STL-10**: A dataset with 10 classes, containing 500 labeled training images and 8,000 unlabeled images, designed for unsupervised learning.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their full citations for reference.
