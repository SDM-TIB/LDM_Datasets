To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Applications of the multi-sigmoidal deterministic and stochastic logistic models for plant dynamics" by Antonio Di Crescenzo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any datasets or real-world data applications. The introduction often sets the context for the research and may highlight key datasets that are central to the study.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used in the experiments or analyses. This section typically details the data collection process, including any datasets that were analyzed or modeled.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** for any references to datasets, as the authors may discuss their findings in relation to specific datasets.

If the paper includes a **results section** that presents data or findings based on specific datasets, I will take note of these datasets and their characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset related to coffee fruit maturation, I will look for the original source of that dataset in the references. If the dataset is derived from a specific study, I will ensure to include that citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
