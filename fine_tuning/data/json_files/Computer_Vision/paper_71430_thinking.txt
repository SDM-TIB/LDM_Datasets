To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Medical Visual Prompting (MVP): A Unified Framework for Versatile and High-Quality Medical Image Segmentation" by Yulin Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on five datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section IV (Experiment)**, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they mention three tasks: Endoscopic polyp segmentation, CT segmentation, and MRI segmentation, and list the datasets associated with each task.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Kvasir-SEG**: An open-access dataset of gastrointestinal polyp images and corresponding segmentation masks, manually labeled by a physician and validated by an experienced gastroenterologist.

2. **Nasopharynx**: A dataset collected by Dr. Jie Deng in 2021, approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. Labels were annotated by two specialized endoscopists.

3. **2D-CT-Lung**: A public dataset for medical image segmentation from the Kaggle Data Science Bowl 2017.

4. **ESOCT**: A dataset provided by Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, consisting of CT scans from 30 esophageal cancer patients.

5. **BIMR**: A privately owned breast dataset obtained from a novel 3D breast imaging device, labeled by medical experts.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** or any relevant sections in the paper. However, the paper does not provide explicit citations for these datasets, so I will note that they are either publicly available or privately owned without specific citations.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and any relevant details, ensuring to include the context of their use in the experiments.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

- **Kvasir-SEG**: Open-access dataset for gastrointestinal polyp segmentation.
- **Nasopharynx**: Dataset for nasopharynx segmentation, annotated by specialists.
- **2D-CT-Lung**: Public dataset from Kaggle for lung segmentation.
- **ESOCT**: Dataset from esophageal cancer patients.
- **BIMR**: Private dataset for breast imaging.

I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
