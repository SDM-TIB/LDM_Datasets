To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BRI3L: A BRIGHTNESS ILLUSION IMAGE DATASET FOR IDENTIFICATION AND LOCALIZATION OF REGIONS OF ILLUSORY PERCEPTION" by Aniket Roy et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract states that the authors generated a large-scale dataset of **22,366 images** (BRI3L) for studying brightness illusions, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the dataset. The introduction mentions the dataset's purpose and the types of brightness illusions included, but I need to find specific details about the dataset's structure and contents.

In **section 3 (BRI3L: A BRIGHTNESS ILLUSION IMAGE DATASET)**, the authors provide a comprehensive description of the dataset. They specify that it contains images of five types of brightness illusions: 
1. **Hermann grid**
2. **Simultaneous Brightness Contrast (SBC)**
3. **White illusion**
4. **Induced grating**
5. **Grid illusion**

The dataset also includes **1,149 non-illusion images** generated to serve as a control group. Each image is annotated with binary segmentation masks corresponding to the illusory regions.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors do not provide separate citations for the dataset itself, as it is their original contribution. However, they reference several foundational papers related to the types of illusions included in the dataset. I will extract these references to provide context for the dataset's development.

The relevant citations from the references section include:
- Hermann grid: 
  > Ludimar Hermann, “Eine erscheinung simultanen contrasts,” Pflügers Archiv European Journal of Physiology, vol. 3, no. 1, pp. 13–15, 1870.
  
- Simultaneous Brightness Contrast:
  > Eric G Heinemann, “Simultaneous brightness induction as a function of inducing-and test-field luminances,” Journal of experimental psychology, vol. 50, no. 2, pp. 89, 1955.

- White illusion:
  > Michael White, “A new effect of pattern on perceived lightness,” Perception, vol. 8, no. 4, pp. 413–416, 1979.

- Induced grating:
  > John M Foley and Mark E McCourt, “Visual grating induction,” JOSA A, vol. 2, no. 7, pp. 1220–1230, 1985.

- Grid illusion:
  > Alan Gilchrist, “A gestalt account of lightness illusions,” Perception, vol. 43, no. 9, pp. 881–895, 2014.

Now, I will compile the dataset information and citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and the relevant citations for each type of illusion included in the BRI3L dataset.
