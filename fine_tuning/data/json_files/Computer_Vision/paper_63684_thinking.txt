To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "A Novel Loss Function Utilizing Wasserstein Distance to Reduce Subject-Dependent Noise for Generalizable Models in Affective Computing" by Nibraas A. Khan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the performance of the proposed cost function is demonstrated through an autoencoder trained on four different datasets. This suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.4 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **WESAD**: A multimodal dataset for wearable stress and affect detection, recorded using various sensors from 15 subjects. The dataset aims to detect three affective states: neutral, stress, and amusement.

2. **AMIGOS**: This dataset includes physiological data from 40 volunteers while watching videos. It contains sensor data (EEG, ECG, GSR) and is annotated with self-assessments of emotional states.

3. **DEAP**: A dataset that includes physiological signals from 32 volunteers while they watched music videos. It is self-annotated with labels for arousal, valence, and other emotional dimensions.

4. **CLAS**: This dataset consists of physiological data from 60 patients engaged in cognitively difficult tasks, with labels based on the cognitive load experienced during these tasks.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
