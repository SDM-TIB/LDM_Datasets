To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PatchVAE: Learning Local Latent Codes for Recognition" by Kamal Gupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are present in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they explicitly mention the datasets they used, which are:

1. **CIFAR100**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 100 classes, with 600 images per class. The authors mention that there are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

2. **MIT Indoor Scene Recognition**: This dataset contains 67 categories and a total of 15,620 images, with training and testing subsets consisting of 80 and 20 images per class, respectively.

3. **Places**: This dataset has 2.5 million images across 205 categories, which is significant for evaluating the performance of their model.

4. **ImageNet**: This is a well-known dataset with over a million images from 1,000 categories, widely used for image classification tasks.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
