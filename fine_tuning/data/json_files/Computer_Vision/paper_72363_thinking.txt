To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Realisation of Channel Emulation in a Reverberation Chamber method for Over-the-Air Compliance Testing in Support of 3GPP Standardisation" by Yunsong Gui and Tian Hong Loh, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of channel emulation and mentions a novel approach, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss various methods and technologies related to over-the-air (OTA) testing. They reference existing methods and standards but do not specify any datasets at this point.

I will then examine the **measurement setup and results section**. Here, the authors describe the experimental setup and the parameters used for channel sounding measurements. They mention using a high accuracy channel sounder and specific channel models defined in 3GPP standards, but again, no specific datasets are named.

In the **results section**, the authors present measurement results and analysis, including figures and tables that detail the parameters of the channel sounder and the channel models used. They reference two channel models: the **Pedestrian-B model** and the **Tapped Delay Line B (TDL-B) model**. However, they do not provide specific datasets or citations for these models.

Finally, I will check the **references section** for any citations that might correspond to datasets or models used in the experiments. The references include various 3GPP technical reports and papers that describe the channel models, but they do not provide specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets with full citations, I will summarize the relevant channel models used in the experiments:

1. **Pedestrian-B Model**: This model is defined in the 3GPP specifications and is used for simulating a scenario with fewer multipaths. The reference for this model is:
   > 3GPP TR 38.901 V17.0.0 (2022-03), “Study on channel model for frequencies from 0.5 to 100 GHz”, March. 2022.

2. **Tapped Delay Line B (TDL-B) Model**: This model is also defined in the 3GPP specifications and is used for simulating a rich multipath environment. The reference for this model is:
   > 3GPP TR 38.901 V17.0.0 (2022-03), “Study on channel model for frequencies from 0.5 to 100 GHz”, March. 2022.

Since both models are part of the same 3GPP technical report, I will note that they share the same citation.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets (or models) into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the full citations for each model as required.
