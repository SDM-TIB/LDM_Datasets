To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "DIALCLIP: EMPOWERING CLIP AS MULTI-MODAL DIALOG RETRIEVER" by Zhichao Yin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that their method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two widely recognized benchmark datasets. This indicates that datasets are indeed involved, and I need to find their names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the experiments section, the authors explicitly mention using **PhotoChat** and **MMDialog** as the benchmark datasets for their evaluations. This is a clear indication that these are the datasets I need to document.

Now, I will gather detailed descriptions of each dataset. The paper mentions that **PhotoChat** is a dataset for a photo-sharing task, while **MMDialog** is described as the largest multimodal dialogue dataset. However, I need to find more specific details about these datasets, such as their structure, size, and any unique characteristics.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. Here, I will locate the full citations for both datasets:

- For **PhotoChat**, the citation is:
  > Xiaoxue Zang, Lijuan Liu, Maria Wang, Yang Song, Hao Zhang, and Jindong Chen. *Photochat: A human-human dialogue dataset with photo sharing behavior for joint image-text modeling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2108.01453, 2021.

- For **MMDialog**, the citation is:
  > Jiazhan Feng, Qingfeng Sun, Can Xu, Pu Zhao, Yaming Yang, Chongyang Tao, Dongyan Zhao, and Qingwei Lin. *MMDIALOG: A large-scale multi-turn dialogue dataset towards multi-modal open-domain conversation*. In ACL (1). 2023, pp. 7348â€“7363, Association for Computational Linguistics.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **PhotoChat**: A dataset designed for a photo-sharing task, facilitating joint image-text modeling.
2. **MMDialog**: The largest multimodal dialogue dataset, used for evaluating multi-modal dialog systems.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or analysis.
