To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Optimal Patch Size in Vision Transformers for Tumor Segmentation" by Ramtin Mojtahedi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validated their framework using a "multi-resolution public dataset" and a "private multi-resolution mCRC dataset." This suggests that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experimental results** sections, particularly focusing on **section 3 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe two datasets:

1. **LiTS Dataset**: This dataset consists of 201 CT images with liver and liver tumor annotations, with 131 images for training and 70 for testing. The dataset includes a variety of cancer types and has voxel spacings ranging from 0.56 mm to 1.0 mm in the axial plane.

2. **mCRC Dataset**: This private dataset contains 198 CT scans of patients who underwent hepatic resection for colorectal liver metastasis. The scans have voxel spacings ranging from 0.61 mm to 0.98 mm in the axial plane.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **LiTS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bilic, P., Christ, P.F., Vorontsov, E., et al. *The Liver Tumor Segmentation Benchmark (LiTS)*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.04056, 2019.

- For the **mCRC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Simpson, A.L., Doussot, A., Creasy, J.M., et al. *Computed tomography image texture: A noninvasive prognostic marker of hepatic recurrence after hepatectomy for metastatic colorectal cancer*. Annals of Surgical Oncology, 24, 2482â€“2490, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its respective citation, ready for any downstream tasks or reviews.
