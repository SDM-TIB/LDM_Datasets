To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Spatial-temporal Graph Deep Learning Model for Urban Flood Nowcasting Leveraging Heterogeneous Community Features" by Hamed Farahmand et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves a novel modeling framework for urban flood nowcasting, which suggests that various datasets are likely used.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, specifically the **data collection and preprocessing** subsection. Here, the authors describe the datasets they utilized for their model. They mention using traffic condition data from INRIX, which is crucial for determining flooded road segments. 

1. **INRIX Traffic Data**: This dataset includes traffic condition data for 19,712 road segments in Harris County, collected at 5-minute intervals. The authors specify that this data is used to identify flooded road segments based on average traffic speed.

In addition to INRIX, the authors mention other datasets:

2. **Flood Gauge Data**: The study utilizes data from 175 flood gauge stations in Harris County, which provide rainfall accumulation and water elevation data. This dataset is essential for capturing physics-based features related to flooding.

3. **3-1-1 Flood Reports**: The authors collected 4,275 flood-related reports from the City of Houston's 3-1-1 platform during the study period. This dataset is used to assess flood status based on community reports.

4. **Twitter Data**: The authors gathered 29,256 geotagged tweets related to flooding during the study period, which serves as a source of human-sensed data for flood nowcasting.

5. **Mapbox Human Activity Data**: The study also incorporates telemetry-based human activity data from Mapbox, which provides insights into human activity levels during the flood event.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **INRIX Traffic Data**:
  > INRIX. "Traffic Condition Data." [Online]. Available: https://www.inrix.com/. [Accessed: Date].

- For **Flood Gauge Data**:
  > Harris County Flood Control District. "Harris County Flood Warning System." [Online]. Available: https://www.harriscountyfws.org/. [Accessed: Date].

- For **3-1-1 Flood Reports**:
  > City of Houston. "Houston 3-1-1 Help Information." [Online]. Available: https://www.houstontx.gov/311/. [Accessed: Date].

- For **Mapbox Human Activity Data**:
  > Mapbox. "Telemetry-based Human Activity Data." [Online]. Available: https://www.mapbox.com/. [Accessed: Date].

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant datasets are documented with proper citations, which is crucial for academic integrity and reproducibility.
