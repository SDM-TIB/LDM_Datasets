To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Eliminating Lipschitz Singularities in Diffusion Models" by Zhantao Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors discuss conducting experiments on various datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 5)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention implementing their method on several widely evaluated datasets, specifically:

1. **FFHQ 256 × 256**: This dataset is referenced multiple times throughout the paper, indicating its significance in the experiments.
2. **CelebAHQ 256 × 256**: Another dataset mentioned in the context of performance evaluation.
3. **AFHQ-Cat 256 × 256**: This dataset is used for comparative analysis.
4. **AFHQ-Wild 256 × 256**: Similar to AFHQ-Cat, this dataset is also utilized in the experiments.
5. **Lsun-Church 256 × 256**: This dataset is included in the evaluation of the proposed method.
6. **Lsun-Cat 256 × 256**: Another dataset mentioned in the context of performance metrics.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
