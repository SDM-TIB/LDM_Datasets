To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compiler-Driven Simulation of Reconfigurable Hardware Accelerators" by Zhijing Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a compiler-driven simulation workflow but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **case studies and experiments sections**. These sections often contain specific references to datasets used for validation or testing. I will look for any mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics.

In the **case studies**, particularly the one on the systolic array, the authors might refer to datasets used for performance evaluation. I will pay close attention to any figures, tables, or descriptions that might indicate the datasets utilized in their experiments.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "SCALE-Sim" in the context of comparing simulation results, I will ensure to find its full citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> A. Samajdar, Y. Zhu, P. Whatmough, M. Mattina, and T. Krishna. *SCALE-Sim: Systolic CNN Accelerator Simulator*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.02883, 2018.

Once I have gathered all the relevant datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation for each dataset.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and complete, ready for any further processing or review.
