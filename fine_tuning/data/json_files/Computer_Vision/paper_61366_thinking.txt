To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RewriteLM: An Instruction-Tuned Large Language Model for Text Rewriting" by Lei Shu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the introduction of a novel benchmark called **OPENREWRITEEVAL**, which suggests that this is a key dataset related to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation Framework)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the **OPENREWRITEEVAL** benchmark. They describe it as a dataset designed for cross-sentence rewriting tasks, which includes various subtasks such as formality, paraphrasing, shortening, and elaboration. This section will provide insights into the structure and purpose of the dataset.

In **section 4.1**, the authors list the specific datasets included in **OPENREWRITEEVAL**:
1. **DFormality**: A dataset with 200 examples focused on making text more formal.
2. **DParaphrase**: A dataset with 102 examples aimed at paraphrasing text.
3. **DShorten**: A dataset with 102 examples for shortening text.
4. **DElaborate**: A dataset with 102 examples for elaborating on text.
5. **DMixedWiki**: A dataset with 606 examples sourced from Wikipedia.
6. **DMixedOthers**: A dataset with 517 examples from various sources.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference several sources for the datasets used in **OPENREWRITEEVAL**. For example, they mention that the source texts for the datasets come from various datasets, including Multi-News, Wikipedia, PG-19, BIGPATENT, BillSum, and others.

Here are the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing.
