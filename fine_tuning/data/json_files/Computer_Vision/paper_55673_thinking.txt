To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Text2Light: Zero-Shot Text-Driven HDR Panorama Generation" by Zhaoxi Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a framework for generating HDR panoramas and mentions the construction of a dataset, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their research. In this section, they introduce the **HDR360-UHD dataset**, which is central to their experiments. The authors provide details about this dataset, including the number of panoramas, the types of scenes included (indoor and outdoor), and the resolution range.

The authors state that the **HDR360-UHD dataset** contains 4,392 HDR panoramas with resolutions ranging from 4096 × 2048 (4K) to 8192 × 4096 (8K). They also mention that the dataset includes 1,891 outdoor scenes and 2,501 indoor scenes, and that they augmented the data by rotating the panoramas to increase the total number to 48,312. Additionally, they collected 1,901 scene descriptions to facilitate text-driven scene synthesis.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the HDR360-UHD dataset. However, since this dataset is newly constructed by the authors and does not have a separate publication, I will note that the citation for the dataset will reference the paper itself.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> Zhaoxi Chen, Guangcong Wang, and Ziwei Liu. 2022. Text2Light: Zero-Shot Text-Driven HDR Panorama Generation. ACM Trans. Graph. 41, 6, Article 195 (December 2022), 16 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3550454.3555447

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the dataset is properly documented for future reference or use in related research.
