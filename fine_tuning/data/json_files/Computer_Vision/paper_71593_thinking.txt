To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Generative Models through the Lens of the Manifold Hypothesis: A Survey and New Connections" by Gabriel Loaiza-Ganem et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or datasets**. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the datasets used, while the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any subsections that explicitly mention datasets. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

As I identify datasets, I will take note of their names and any citations provided in the text. It is crucial to ensure that I capture the full citation for each dataset, as this will be important for proper attribution and further reference.

After gathering the dataset names and their descriptions, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This may involve looking for specific papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, if the paper mentions the "CIFAR-10 dataset," I will look for its citation in the References section, which typically includes the authors, title, conference or journal name, and year of publication.

Once I have compiled the dataset names and their full citations, I will organize this information clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its corresponding citation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that I have captured all relevant datasets mentioned in the paper, along with their full citations, ready for further processing or review.
