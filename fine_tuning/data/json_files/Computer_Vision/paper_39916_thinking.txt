To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Rotation Adaptive Correlation Filters in Robust Visual Object Tracking" by Litu Rout et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights that the authors conducted experiments on the **VOT2016 dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The introduction discusses challenges in visual object tracking but does not explicitly name additional datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **experiments section** for more detailed information.

In the **experiments section (Section 6)**, the authors mention that they evaluated their methods on the **VOT2016** and **OTB100** benchmarks. This confirms that both datasets are used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **VOT2016 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Kristan, M., Matas, J., Leonardis, A., Vojir, T., Pflugfelder, R., Fernandez, G., Nebehay, G., Porikli, F., Cehovin, L. (2016). *A novel performance evaluation methodology for single-target trackers*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 38(11), 2137â€“2155. https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2016.2516982

2. **OTB100 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Wu, Y., Lim, J., Yang, M.H. (2013). *Online object tracking: A benchmark*. In: IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **VOT2016**: A benchmark dataset for evaluating single-target trackers, providing a comprehensive evaluation methodology.
- **OTB100**: A widely used dataset for online object tracking, consisting of 100 video sequences with various challenges.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
