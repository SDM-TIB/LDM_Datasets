To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Modular Deep Learning Pipeline for Galaxy-Scale Strong Gravitational Lens Detection and Modeling" by Sandeep Madireddy et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a synthetic dataset of 120,000 images, which is a significant clue that I should explore further.

Next, I will focus on the **Data Generation section (Section 2)**, where the authors describe the creation of their dataset in detail. They mention generating a dataset consisting of **60,000 galaxy-galaxy strong lenses (GGSLs)** and **60,000 non-GGSLs**. This section provides essential information about the dataset's composition and purpose.

I will also look for any references to the datasets in the **Results and Discussion section (Section 4)**, where the authors discuss how they used the dataset for training and evaluating their deep learning models. They mention splitting the dataset into training and test sets, which further confirms the dataset's structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or catalogs mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to the **cosmoDC2 catalog** and the **PICS simulation program**. I will need to find the full citations for these resources.

1. **CosmoDC2 Catalog**: The citation is:
   > Danila Korytov, Andrew Hearin, Eve Kovacs, Patricia Larsen, Esteban Rangel, Joseph Hollowed, Andrew J. Benson, Katrin Heitmann, Yao-Yuan Mao, Anita Bahmanyar, Chihway Chang, Duncan Campbell, Joseph Derose, Hal Finkel, Nicholas Frontiere, Eric Gawiser, Salman Habib, Benjamin Joachimi, FranÃ§ois Lanusse, Nan Li, Rachel Mandelbaum, Christopher Morrison, Jeffrey A. Newman, Adrian Pope, Eli Rykoff, Melanie Simet, Chun-Hao To, Vinu Vikraman, Risa H. Wechsler, and Martin White. *CosmoDC2: A Synthetic Sky Catalog for Dark Energy Science with LSST*. arXiv e-prints, Article arXiv:1907.06530 (Jul 2019).

2. **PICS Simulation Program**: The citation is:
   > Nan Li, Michael D. Gladders, Esteban M. Rangel, Michael K. Florian, Lindsey E. Bleem, Katrin Heitmann, Salman Habib, and Patricia Fasel. *PICS: Simulations of Strong Gravitational Lensing in Galaxy Clusters*. ApJ 828, 1, Article 54 (Sep 2016), 54 pages. https://doi.org/10.3847/0004-637X/828/1/54.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
