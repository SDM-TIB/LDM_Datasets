To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic of Cloud Computing services for Time Series workflow" by Manuel Parra et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the importance of time series (TS) data in various fields and mentions the need for effective processing and analysis methods. However, it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the significance of TS data but again does not provide specific dataset names.

Next, I will examine the **related work section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of previous studies. This section discusses various methodologies and applications of time series analysis but does not cite specific datasets.

I will then look into the **methodology and proposed schema sections**. Here, the authors describe the tswf-schema for time series workflow modeling. While they mention various operations and algorithms related to time series analysis, they do not provide specific datasets used for validation or experimentation.

After that, I will check the **examples and use cases** presented in the paper. The authors mention using R and Python for implementing time series analysis but do not specify any datasets used in these examples. They refer to a repository for code but do not provide dataset citations.

Finally, I will review the **conclusion and future work sections**. The authors summarize their contributions and suggest future directions for research but do not mention any datasets.

Throughout the paper, there are no explicit mentions of datasets or their citations. Therefore, I will conclude that this paper does not provide specific datasets for extraction.

Since no datasets are identified, I will not be able to provide full citations for any datasets as none are present in the text. If I were to find datasets, I would ensure to extract their names, descriptions, and full citations from the references section, similar to the approach taken in the previous example.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were found in this paper and that the focus was primarily on the methodology and framework for time series analysis rather than specific datasets.
