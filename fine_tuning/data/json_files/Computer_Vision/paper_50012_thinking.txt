To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Forecasting at Scale" by Philippe Chatigny et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental setup)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list six datasets utilized in their evaluation:

1. **M4 Dataset**: A large dataset containing 100,000 heterogeneous time series from various sectors, used in the M4 time series forecasting competition.
2. **M3 Dataset**: Comprising 3,003 heterogeneous time series primarily from financial and economic domains.
3. **Tourism Dataset**: Contains 1,311 time series related to tourism activities, sampled at different frequencies.
4. **Electricity Dataset**: Includes 370 time series representing hourly electricity usage from various customers over three years.
5. **Traffic Dataset**: Comprises 963 time series of hourly occupancy rates on freeways in the San Francisco Bay Area.
6. **Finance Dataset**: A proprietary dataset containing 321 time series of daily closing prices of various U.S. mutual funds and exchange-traded funds.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations:

- **M4 Dataset**:
  > Makridakis, S., Spiliotis, E., & Assimakopoulos, V. (2020). The M4 competition: Results, findings, and conclusions. *International Journal of Forecasting*, 34(4), 802-808.

- **M3 Dataset**:
  > Hyndman, R. J., Koehler, A. B., Ord, J. K., & Snyder, R. D. (2005). The M3 competition: Statistical tests of the results. *International Journal of Forecasting*, 21(3), 397-409.

- **Tourism Dataset**:
  > Athanasopoulos, G., Hyndman, R. J., Song, H., & Wu, D. C. (2011). The tourism forecasting competition. *International Journal of Forecasting*, 27(3), 822-844.

- **Electricity Dataset**:
  > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). UCI machine learning repository. Retrieved from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml

- **Traffic Dataset**:

- **Finance Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is not explicitly provided in the references, as it is proprietary. However, the authors mention that details are available in Appendix A.5.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset used in the research.
