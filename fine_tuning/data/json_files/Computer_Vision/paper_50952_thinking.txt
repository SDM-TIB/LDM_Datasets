To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Calibrated Diffusion Tensor Estimation" by Davood Karimi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may include references to datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods section**, specifically looking for any subsection that discusses the datasets. In this paper, the authors mention using the **developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) dataset** and the **Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics (PING) dataset**. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets, such as the number of scans, age ranges of subjects, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study.

In the **Results and Discussion section**, I will look for any additional context or insights regarding the datasets, such as how they were utilized in the experiments or any comparisons made between them. This may help clarify the significance of each dataset in the context of the research findings.

After gathering information about the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For the **dHCP dataset**, the citation is:
> Developing Human Connectome Project, KCL-Imperial-Oxford Consortium funded by the European Research Council under the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP/2007-2013) / ERC Grant Agreement no. [319456].

For the **PING dataset**, the citation is:
> T. L. Jernigan et al., “The pediatric imaging, neurocognition, and genetics (PING) data repository,” Neuroimage, vol. 124, pp. 1149–1154, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the extracted information is organized and easily accessible for further use or analysis.
