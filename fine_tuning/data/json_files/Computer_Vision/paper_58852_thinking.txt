To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion Models in Bioinformatics: A New Wave of Deep Learning Revolution in Action" by Zhiye Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and applications sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on diffusion models in bioinformatics, but I need to look for specific datasets in the detailed sections.

Next, I will focus on the **applications section**, where the authors discuss various domains of bioinformatics where diffusion models have been applied. This section is likely to contain references to specific datasets used in their studies.

As I read through the applications, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, such as:

1. **Cryo-EM data**: The authors reference the CryoDRGN model, which utilizes cryo-EM data for protein structure reconstruction. I will need to find the original source or citation for this dataset.

2. **Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data**: The paper discusses the DEWAKSS model, which applies a diffusion model to scRNA-seq data. I will look for the citation that describes this dataset.

3. **Protein Data Bank (PDB)**: The authors mention using the PDB for generating realistic proteins. I will ensure to include the citation for the PDB.

4. **Other specific models and datasets**: Throughout the applications, the authors mention various models like RFDiffusion, SMCDiff, and others that likely have associated datasets. I will need to identify and cite these as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** of the paper to gather full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper documentation.

For example, I will look for citations like:
- For **Cryo-EM data**, I might find a reference such as:
  > Zhong, E. D., et al. "CryoDRGN: reconstruction of heterogeneous cryo-EM structures using neural networks." *Nature Methods* 18, 176-185 (2021).

- For **scRNA-seq data**, I might find:
  > TjÃ¤rnberg, A. et al. "Optimal tuning of weighted kNN-and diffusion-based methods for denoising single cell genomics data." *PLoS Computational Biology* 17, e1008569 (2021).

- For the **Protein Data Bank**, the citation is:
  > Berman, H. M., et al. "The protein data bank." *Nucleic Acids Research* 28, 235-242 (2000).

Once I have gathered all the necessary information and citations, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that the information is accurate and complete for future reference or analysis.
