To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Low-tubal-rank Tensor Completion using Alternating Minimization" by Xiao-Yang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, dimensions, or characteristics of the datasets.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any references to synthetic data or real-world datasets used for evaluation. The authors may also mention the source of these datasets or any preprocessing steps taken.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a synthetic dataset generated according to a specific model, I will note that down along with any parameters used for generation. If they reference a well-known dataset, I will ensure to capture the full citation as provided in the references.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for detailed descriptions of datasets used.
3. Note any specific characteristics or parameters related to the datasets.
4. Check the references for full citations of the datasets.
5. Compile the information into a clear and structured format for documentation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing complete citations for each.
