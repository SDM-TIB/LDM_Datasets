To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Annotator Consensus Prediction for Medical Image Segmentation with Diffusion Models" by Tomer Amit et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on several datasets of medical segmentation annotated by multiple experts, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. Here, they mention the **QUBIQ benchmark**, which is a challenge dataset specifically designed for evaluating inter-rater variability in medical image segmentation. The details provided in this section are crucial for identifying the datasets used.

The authors describe four different segmentation datasets included in the QUBIQ benchmark:
1. **Brain Growth Dataset**: This dataset consists of MRI images with one task, annotated by seven raters, containing 34 cases for training and 5 cases for testing.
2. **Brain Tumor Dataset**: This dataset also consists of MRI images, with one task, annotated by three raters, containing 28 cases for training and 4 cases for testing.
3. **Prostate Dataset**: This dataset includes two subtasks, using MRI images, annotated by six raters, with 33 cases for training and 15 cases for testing.
4. **Kidney Dataset**: This dataset consists of CT images, annotated by three raters, containing 20 cases for training and 4 cases for testing.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. However, the QUBIQ benchmark is a challenge dataset, and it may not have a single citation but rather be referenced as part of the challenge details.

The authors mention that the QUBIQ dataset is available for evaluation in the context of the MICCAI 2020 conference. Therefore, I will look for the official citation for the QUBIQ benchmark, which is likely to be found in the conference proceedings or related publications.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the QUBIQ benchmark as follows:

- **QUBIQ Benchmark**: 
  > "Quantification of Uncertainties in Biomedical Image Quantification Challenge." In Proceedings of the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), 2020.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
