To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data augmentation with Mobius transformations" by Sharon Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on several benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The authors note that it has a standard split of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 60,000 images but is divided into 100 classes, with 600 images per class. The training and test splits are the same as CIFAR-10.

3. **Tiny ImageNet**: This dataset is a subset of ImageNet, containing 100,000 images across 200 classes, with 500 training images per class and 10,000 test images.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics for their method on these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **Tiny ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > J. Wu, Q. Zhang, G. Xu. *Tiny ImageNet Challenge*. Technical report, Stanford University, 2017.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets, ensuring to include the full citations for each one. This will allow for clear documentation and reference in any subsequent analysis or processing.
