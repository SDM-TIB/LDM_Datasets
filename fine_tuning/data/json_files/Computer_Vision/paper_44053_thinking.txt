To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Crack Detection on Road Pavements Using Encoder-Decoder Architecture" by Zhun Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on public crack databases, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant subsections within the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention using two public databases: **CFD** and **AigleRN**. I will note the details provided about these datasets, including the number of images, types of images, and any specific characteristics mentioned.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide additional context about how these datasets were used, including the number of images allocated for training and testing. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' application in their research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the following:

1. **CFD Database**: 
   > Shi, Y.; Cui, L.; Qi, Z.; Meng, F.; Chen, Z. Automatic road crack detection using random structured forests. *IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems* 2016, 17, 3434–3445.

2. **AigleRN Database**: 
   > Amhaz, R.; Chambon, S.; Idier, J.; Baltazart, V. Automatic Crack Detection on Two-Dimensional Pavement Images: An Algorithm Based on Minimal Path Selection. *IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems* 2016, 17, 2718–2729.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as noted above.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured and cited.
