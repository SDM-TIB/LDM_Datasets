To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Image Synthesis with Graph Conditioning: CLIP-Guided Diffusion Models for Scene Graphs" by Rameshwar Mishra and A V Subramanyam, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks, specifically **COCO-stuff** and **Visual Genome** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look closely at the **experiments section** (section 4) to confirm the datasets used. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they train and evaluate their model on the **COCO-stuff** and **Visual Genome** datasets. They provide details about the number of image-graph pairs in each dataset, which further confirms their usage.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **COCO-stuff dataset**, the citation is:
   > Holger Caesar, Jasper Uijlings, and Vittorio Ferrari. *Coco-stuff: Thing and stuff classes in context*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 1209–1218, 2018.

2. For the **Visual Genome dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ranjay Krishna, Yuke Zhu, Oliver Groth, Joshua Kravitz, Stephanie Chen, Yannis Kalantidis, Li-Jia Li, David A Shamma, et al. *Visual genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations*. International journal of computer vision, 123:32–73, 2017.

Having gathered this information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
