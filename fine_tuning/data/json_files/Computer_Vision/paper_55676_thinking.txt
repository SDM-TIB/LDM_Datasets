To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Review of data types and model dimensionality for cardiac DTI SMS-related artefact removal" by Michael T. Tanzer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly looking for any mention of datasets used for training, validation, or testing the models. The authors describe their experimental setup, including the data acquisition process, which is crucial for identifying the datasets.

In the **experimental setting subsection**, the authors mention that the data used for training came from **31 ex-vivo swine hearts**. They specify that the data was acquired with a simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) factor equal to 2 and a distance factor equal to 400%. This indicates that the dataset is derived from a specific imaging protocol, but I need to find the formal name or citation for this dataset.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors refer to any specific datasets when discussing their findings. They mention the number of slices used for training, validation, and testing, which reinforces the importance of the dataset.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The authors may reference previous works that describe the datasets or the protocols used to acquire them.

Based on my findings, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset. For example, if the authors refer to a specific dataset or imaging protocol, I will note it down along with its citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the citations are complete and correctly formatted for future reference.
