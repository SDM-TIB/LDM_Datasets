To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Wrapped Distributions on Homogeneous Riemannian Manifolds" by Fernando Galaz-Garc√≠a et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for validation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference datasets that are relevant to their research. I will look for phrases that indicate the use of datasets, such as "we evaluated our method on," "we used the following datasets," or similar expressions.

Then, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used the **MNIST dataset**, I would look for its citation in the references, which typically includes the authors, title, source, and year of publication. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ready for further processing or review, while ensuring that the full citations are included for each dataset identified.
