To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Bayesian Permutation Training Deep Representation Learning Method for Speech Enhancement with Variational Autoencoder" by Yang Xiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but the details about datasets are likely to be found in the experiments section.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that they used the **TIMIT database**, **DEMAND database**, **NOISEX-92 database**, and **environmental noises** for their experiments. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about each dataset. The authors describe how they used the **TIMIT database** for training and testing, mentioning that all 4620 utterances were corrupted by various types of noise. They also specify that they used **100 environmental noises** and **92 types of noise** from the NOISEX-92 database, which adds context to the datasets used.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **TIMIT Database**:
   > Garofolo, J. S., Lamel, L. F., Fisher, W. M., Fiscus, J. G., & Pallett, D. S. (1993). *DARPA TIMIT acoustic-phonetic continuous speech corpus CD-ROM. NIST speech disc 1-1.1*. NASA STI/Recon technical report n, vol. 93.

2. **DEMAND Database**:

3. **NOISEX-92 Database**:
   > Varga, A., & Steeneken, H. J. (1993). *Assessment for automatic speech recognition: II. NOISEX-92: A database and an experiment to study the effect of additive noise on speech recognition systems*. Speech Communication, 12(3), 247-251.

4. **Environmental Noises**: The paper mentions using 100 environmental noises but does not provide a specific citation for this dataset. It may be part of the DEMAND database or another source that is not explicitly cited.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
