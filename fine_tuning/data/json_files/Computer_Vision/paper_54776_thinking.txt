To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning Leads to Higher Adversarial Susceptibility" by Rohit Gupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of contrastive self-supervised learning (CSL) on image and video classification tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their use in the experiments.

Upon reviewing Section 4.3, I find that the authors mention two datasets used for video classification:

1. **UCF101**: This dataset is a widely used benchmark for action recognition in videos, containing 13,320 videos across 101 action categories.

2. **HMDB51**: Another popular dataset for action recognition, consisting of 7,000 clips from 51 action categories.

Both datasets are confirmed to be used in the experiments, as the authors compare the robustness of models trained on these datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

- For **UCF101**, the citation is:
  > Soomro, K., Zamir, A. R., & Shah, M. (2012). *UCF101: A Dataset of 101 Human Actions Classes From Videos in the Wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402.

- For **HMDB51**, the citation is:
  > Kuehne, H., Jhuang, H., Garofalo, J., & Black, M. J. (2011). *HMDB: A Large Human Motion Database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2556-2563.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for structured output or further processing.
