To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MOFA-Video: Controllable Image Animation via Generative Motion Field Adaptions in Frozen Image-to-Video Diffusion Model" by Muyao Niu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the method's capabilities but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methods sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of various control signals for video generation, but again, no specific datasets are named. I will proceed to the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed.

In **section 4 (Experiment)**, the authors describe their implementation details and mention training their model on **WebVid-10M**. This dataset is crucial as it is used for training the proposed MOFA-Adapter. The authors also mention that they trained a portrait-based model on a self-compiled dataset consisting of **5,889 different human portrait videos**. This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved in their experiments.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets:

1. **WebVid-10M**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Bain, M., Nagrani, A., Varol, G., Zisserman, A. "Frozen in time: A joint video and image encoder for end-to-end retrieval." In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021.

2. **Self-compiled dataset**: Since this dataset is self-compiled and does not have a formal citation, I will note that it consists of **5,889 different human portrait videos** but will not provide a citation.

Now, I will summarize the datasets extracted:

- **WebVid-10M**: A large-scale dataset used for training the MOFA-Adapter.
- **Self-compiled dataset**: A dataset of 5,889 human portrait videos used for training the portrait-based MOFA-Adapter.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
