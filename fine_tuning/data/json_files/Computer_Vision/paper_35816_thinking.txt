To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Expressive Power of Overlapping Architectures of Deep Learning" by Or Sharir and Amnon Shashua, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract typically provides a summary of the work and may reference datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section usually contains detailed information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including any tables or figures that may summarize the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will look for any papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail.

For each dataset identified, I will note the following details:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of data).
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, formatted according to academic standards.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the information is organized and accessible for future reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and proper citation practices.
