To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "Model Detoxification Through the Lens of Prompt Dependence" by Daniel Scalena et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experimental setup, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions the application of detoxification approaches to several language models, which suggests that datasets are involved in the evaluation process.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of detoxifying language models and reference various techniques, but I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section**. Here, the authors mention that they evaluate their detoxification methods on two instruction-tuned language models: **RedPajama 3B** and **Falcon 7B**. They also specify that they perform detoxification using the **DIALOCONAN** dataset for counter-narrative fine-tuning and evaluate the models on the **RealToxicityPrompts (RTP)** dataset.

Now, I will gather detailed information about each dataset:

1. **DIALOCONAN Dataset**: This dataset is used for counter-narrative fine-tuning. I will need to find the full citation for this dataset in the references section.

2. **RealToxicityPrompts (RTP) Dataset**: This dataset is used to evaluate the toxicity of model generations. I will also look for its full citation in the references section.

In the **references section**, I will locate the citations for both datasets:

- For the **DIALOCONAN dataset**, the citation is:
  > Helena Bonaldi, Sara Dellantonio, Serra Sinem Tekiro˘glu, and Marco Guerini. *Human-machine collaboration approaches to build a dialogue dataset for hate speech countering*. In Proceedings of the 2022 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 8031–8049, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **RealToxicityPrompts (RTP) dataset**, the citation is:
  > Samuel Gehman, Suchin Gururangan, Maarten Sap, Yejin Choi, and Noah A. Smith. *RealToxicityPrompts: Evaluating neural toxic degeneration in language models*. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2020, pages 3356–3369, Online. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This will prepare the information for any further processing or review.
