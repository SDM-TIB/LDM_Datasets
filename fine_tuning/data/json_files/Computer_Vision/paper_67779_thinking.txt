To extract datasets from the research paper titled "I’m HOI: Inertia-aware Monocular Capture of 3D Human-Object Interactions" by Chengfeng Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors contribute a large dataset with ground truth human and object motions, dense RGB inputs, and rich object-mounted IMU measurements. This suggests that a specific dataset is being introduced.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this case, I find that the authors explicitly describe their dataset in **section 4 (Dataset)**. They mention the **Inertial and Multi-view Highly Dynamic human-object interactions Dataset (IMHD2)**, which consists of human and object motions, inertial measurements, and object 3D scans.

In this section, the authors provide details about the dataset, including:
- The dataset contains **295 interaction sequences** with **10 diverse objects** and a total of **892k frames** of recording.
- It includes ground truth body, hand, and 3D object meshes, along with dense RGB inputs and rich object-mounted IMU measurements.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the IMHD2 dataset. However, since the dataset is newly introduced in this paper, it may not have a separate citation. Instead, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> Zhao, C., Zhang, J., Yu, J., Du, J., Wang, J., Shan, Z., Xu, L., & Wang, J. (2023). I’m HOI: Inertia-aware Monocular Capture of 3D Human-Object Interactions. *Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset extracted from the paper.
