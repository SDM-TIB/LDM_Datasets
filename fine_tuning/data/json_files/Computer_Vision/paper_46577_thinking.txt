To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Biomimetic peptide enriched nonwoven scaffolds promote calcium phosphate mineralisation" by Robabeh Gharaei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of self-assembling peptides (SAPs) and their role in promoting mineralization, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the challenges of bone repair and the properties of mineralized tissues, but again, there are no specific datasets mentioned.

Moving on to the **materials and methods** section, I will look for any experimental datasets or data collection methods. The authors describe the preparation of electrospun scaffolds and the use of simulated body fluid (SBF) for testing apatite formation. However, they do not provide specific datasets in this section.

In the **results and discussion** section, I will focus on the findings related to the apatite nucleation and growth capabilities of the scaffolds. The authors present data on the calcium to phosphorus (Ca:P) ratios from energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis and other quantitative results. I will extract these specific datasets, including the mean Ca:P ratios at different time points and conditions.

Finally, I will check the **references** section to find full citations for any datasets or studies referenced in the paper. However, since the paper primarily discusses experimental results without referencing external datasets, I will focus on the data presented within the paper itself.

The key datasets I will extract include:

1. **Calcium to Phosphorus Ratios**: The mean Ca:P ratios for PCL scaffolds supplemented with P11-4 and P11-8 at various incubation times in SBF.
   - For example, the Ca:P ratio for P11-4 after 1 week is 1.68, and after 4 weeks, it is 1.76.

2. **Peptide Release Kinetics**: Data on the percentage of peptide retained in the scaffolds after incubation at different pH levels.

3. **Cell Viability Data**: The percentage of cell viability for L929 cells in contact with the scaffolds.

After identifying these datasets, I will compile the full citations for any referenced studies or datasets mentioned in the paper. Since the paper does not reference external datasets, I will focus on documenting the experimental results as the primary datasets.

Now, I will prepare to format these datasets into a structured output for further analysis or review.
