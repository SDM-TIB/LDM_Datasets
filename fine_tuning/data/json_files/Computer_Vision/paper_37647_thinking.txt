To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient identification, localization and quantification of grapevine inflorescences in unprepared field images using Fully Convolutional Networks" by Robert Rudolph et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of an automated image-based workflow for quantifying inflorescences, which suggests that image datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods section**, specifically looking for any mention of datasets used for training or evaluation. In this section, the authors describe the image capture process, indicating that they used **108 field images** of the grapevine cultivars 'Riesling' and 'Chardonnay'. They also mention that these images were divided into a training set (98 images) and an evaluation set (10 images), which is crucial information for dataset extraction.

I will also check the **Results section** to see if the authors provide any additional details about the datasets used, such as performance metrics or characteristics of the images. However, the primary dataset information is already captured in the Materials and Methods section.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets. The authors reference several studies that may have used similar datasets or methodologies, but the specific dataset used in this study is primarily the images they captured themselves.

The full citation for the dataset is as follows:
- **Dataset of grapevine images**: Rudolph, R., Herzog, K., TÃ¶pfer, R., & Steinhage, V. (2018). Efficient identification, localization and quantification of grapevine inflorescences in unprepared field images using Fully Convolutional Networks. *Computers and Electronics in Agriculture*. 

In summary, I have identified the dataset as the collection of 108 field images of grapevine cultivars 'Riesling' and 'Chardonnay', which were used for training and evaluation in the study. I will now compile this information into the required format for further processing.
