To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discovering Influential Factors in Variational Autoencoder" by Shiqi Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention using several datasets for their experiments, specifically **MNIST**, **CelebA**, and **DEAP**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research and should be detailed further.

Next, I will look into the **experimental results section**, where the authors describe how they utilized these datasets. They provide specific details about each dataset, including their purpose and characteristics. 

1. **MNIST**: The authors state that MNIST is a database of handwritten digits, which is widely used for training various image processing systems. This dataset is essential for estimating mutual information and testing the proposed methods.

2. **CelebA**: This dataset is described as a large-scale dataset of celebrity faces with various attributes. The authors used images from CelebA to sustain influential factor discovery, which is critical for their analysis.

3. **DEAP**: The DEAP dataset is noted as a multi-modal emotion recognition dataset. The authors explain that they transformed the EEG signals into video sequences for emotion prediction tasks, highlighting its relevance to their research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Z. Liu, P. Luo, X. Wang, and X. Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 3730–3738, 2015.

- For **DEAP**, the citation is:
  > Koelstra, S., Muhl, C., Soleymani, M., Lee, J.-S., Yazdani, A., Ebrahimi, T., Pun, T., Nijholt, A., and Patras, I. *DEAP: A database for emotion analysis using physiological signals*. IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, 3(1):18–31, 2012.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the extraction is complete and ready for further processing or review.
