To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Information Diffusion in Time-Varying Graphs through Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Matheus R. F. Mendonça, André M. S. Barreto, and Artur Ziviani, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a model trained on a set of artificial time-varying graphs (TVGs) for their experiments, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges of information diffusion in dynamic networks and mention that they trained their model using a series of artificial TVGs. This implies that there are datasets used for training, but I need to find more details.

In the **background and methodology sections**, I will look for any explicit descriptions of the datasets. The authors describe the characteristics of the artificial TVGs they created, including the number of nodes, time steps, and the specific behaviors of the nodes. They mention that the training dataset consists of 500 artificial TVGs and the test dataset consists of 50 artificial TVGs. This is crucial information for dataset extraction.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if any real-world datasets are mentioned. The authors state that they evaluated their model on a real-world TVG built from email exchanges, which has 986 nodes and 332,334 temporal edges. This is another dataset that needs to be documented.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **Artificial TVGs**: The authors do not provide a formal citation for the artificial TVGs since they created them for the study. However, I will note that they are described in detail in the paper.

2. **Real-world Email Dataset**: The citation for the email dataset is:
   > "E-mail communication network dataset." Available at: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/email-Eu-core-temporal.html

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets as required. This will provide a clear overview of the datasets used in the research.
