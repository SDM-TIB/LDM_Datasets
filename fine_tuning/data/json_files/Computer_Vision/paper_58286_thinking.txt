To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Importance of Noise Scheduling for Diffusion Models" by Ting Chen, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the empirical study of noise scheduling strategies for denoising diffusion generative models, but it does not specify any datasets directly.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention conducting experiments on **class-conditional ImageNet** image generation. This indicates that the ImageNet dataset is used, which is a well-known dataset in the field of computer vision.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The relevant citation for the ImageNet dataset is:

- **ImageNet**: 
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *Imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge*. International journal of computer vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the ImageNet dataset for its experiments, I will document this dataset along with its citation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for ImageNet, ensuring that the full citation is included as required. This will provide a clear and complete reference for the dataset used in the research.

After completing this process, I will have a structured entry for the dataset that can be used for further analysis or integration into a larger dataset repository.
