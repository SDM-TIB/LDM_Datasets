To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Listen, Denoise, Action! Audio-Driven Motion Synthesis with Diffusion Models" by Simon Alexanderson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors have made available a new dataset with audio and high-quality 3D motion capture from diverse genres of dance, which suggests that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Data and modelling)**, where the authors provide an overview of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention five different datasets, which I will list and describe in detail:

1. **TSG (Trinity Speech Gesture) Dataset**: This dataset contains around four hours of full-body motion capture and speech audio from a male actor delivering spontaneous monologues. It is used for gesture generation.

2. **ZeroEGGS Dataset**: This dataset includes two hours of speech and full-body motion capture of a female actor delivering monologues in 19 diverse styles. It allows for control over a range of style expressions.

3. **Dance MMA Dataset**: This dataset consists of high-quality recordings of mixed martial arts motion capture, which includes various fighting moves.

4. **100STYLE Dataset**: This dataset contains high-quality 3D motion capture in 100 diverse styles of locomotion, which is used for path-driven locomotion generation.

5. **Dance Dataset**: This dataset combines new and existing high-quality motion-capture data, specifically capturing dance styles such as Jazz, Charleston, Tap dancing, and Locking.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
