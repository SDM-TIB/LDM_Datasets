To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Synthesis of Human Pose From Text" by Yifei Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the **COCO dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Dataset and Training)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset used for training and evaluation. Here, they explicitly state that they use the **COCO (Common Objects in Context)** dataset, which contains over 100,000 annotated images of everyday scenes, each with five human-written text descriptions and annotations for 17 body keypoints. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides additional context about its structure and purpose.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the COCO dataset, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citation for the COCO dataset is as follows:
> Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollar, P., Zitnick, C.L. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **COCO Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for training and evaluating the model. It includes over 100,000 annotated images, each with five text descriptions and annotations for 17 body keypoints.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset and its citation, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
