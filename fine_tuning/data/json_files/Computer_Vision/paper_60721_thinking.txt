To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DiffuSum: Generation Enhanced Extractive Summarization with Diffusion" by Haopeng Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three benchmark summarization datasets: **CNN/DailyMail**, **XSum**, and **PubMed**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are relevant to the research.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiment)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention the three datasets and provide context about each:

1. **CNN/DailyMail**: This dataset is described as containing news articles and corresponding human-written news highlights as summaries. The authors specify the training, validation, and testing splits as (287,084/13,367/11,489).

2. **XSum**: This dataset is characterized as a one-sentence news summarization dataset, with all summaries professionally written by the original authors of the documents. The splits are given as (204,045/11,332/11,334).

3. **PubMed**: This dataset is noted for summarizing scientific papers, specifically using the introduction section as the article and the abstract section as the summary. The splits are (83,233/4,946/5,025).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **CNN/DailyMail**, the citation is:
  > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomas Kocisky, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend*. In Advances in neural information processing systems, pages 1693–1701, 2015.

- For **XSum**, the citation is:
  > Shashi Narayan, Shay B Cohen, and Mirella Lapata. *Don’t give me the details, just the summary! A summary-level framework for extreme summarization*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1808.08745, 2018.

- For **PubMed**, the citation is:
  > Arman Cohan, Franck Dernoncourt, Doo Soon Kim, Trung Bui, Seokhwan Kim, Walter Chang, and Nazli Goharian. *A discourse-aware attention model for abstractive summarization of long documents*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.05685, 2018.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
