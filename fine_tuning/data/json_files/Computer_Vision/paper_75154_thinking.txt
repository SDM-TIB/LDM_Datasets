To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Autoencoder Architecture for L-band Passive Microwave Retrieval of Landscape Freeze-Thaw Cycle" by Divya Kumawat et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses data from the **Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will examine **Section II (Data and Study Area)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they mention:

1. **SMAP Level-3 Enhanced Brightness Temperatures (TB)**: This dataset is used for the analysis of freeze-thaw cycles and is gridded on a 9 km grid from the SMAP satellite observations between 2015 and 2020.

2. **ERA5 Land Data**: The authors utilize gridded hourly and daily surface soil and air temperatures from the ERA5 land reanalysis data at a nominal resolution of 9 km.

3. **In Situ Data**: The paper references the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN), which contains measurements from over 1,500 gauge stations, providing ground-based observations for validation.

In the **References section**, I will look for the full citations of these datasets to ensure proper attribution. The citations I need to gather are:

- For the **SMAP Level-3 Enhanced Brightness Temperatures**, the citation is:
  > Dunbar, S., Xu, X., Colliander, A., Derksen, C., Kimball, J., & Kim, Y. (2016). Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD): SMAP Level 3 Radiometer Freeze/Thaw Data Products (L3 FT P and L3 FT P E). Technical Document JPL D-56288.

- For the **ERA5 Land Data**, the citation is:
  > Hersbach, H., Bell, B., Berrisford, P., Biavati, G., & Horaanyi, A. (2018). Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) Climate Data Store (CDS), ERA5 hourly data on single levels from 1979 to present.

- For the **International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN)**, the citation is:
  > Dorigo, W., Wagner, W., Hohensinn, R., Hahn, S., & Paulik, C. (2011). The International Soil Moisture Network: A data hosting facility for global in situ soil moisture measurements. Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 15(5), 1675â€“1698.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
