To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PHYSCENE: Physically Interactable 3D Scene Synthesis for Embodied AI" by Yandan Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the introduction of PHYSCENE and mentions the need for high-quality interactive scene generation, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using the **3D-FRONT dataset** for training their diffusion model. They specify that this dataset contains 6813 houses with 14629 rooms, which is a significant detail.

Additionally, they mention using the **3D-FUTURE dataset** for object retrieval, which contains CAD models used in the 3D-FRONT dataset. They also refer to **GAPartNet**, which includes articulated objects that are crucial for their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **3D-FRONT Dataset**:
   > Huan Fu, Bowen Cai, Lin Gao, Ling-Xiao Zhang, Jiaming Wang, Cao Li, Qixun Zeng, Chengyue Sun, Rongfei Jia, Binqiang Zhao, et al. *3D-FRONT: 3D Furnished Rooms with Layouts and Semantics*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021.

2. **3D-FUTURE Dataset**:
   > Huan Fu, Rongfei Jia, Lin Gao, Mingming Gong, Binqiang Zhao, Steve Maybank, and Dacheng Tao. *3D-FUTURE: 3D Furniture Shape with Texture*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 129:3313â€“3337, 2021.

3. **GAPartNet**:
   > Haoran Geng, Helin Xu, Chengyang Zhao, Chao Xu, Li Yi, Siyuan Huang, and He Wang. *GAPartNet: Cross-Category Domain-Generalizable Object Perception and Manipulation via Generalizable and Actionable Parts*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
