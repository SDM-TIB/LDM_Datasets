To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STEM Rebalance: A Novel Approach for Tackling Imbalanced Datasets using SMOTE, Edited Nearest Neighbour, and Mixup" by Yumnah Hasan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method using two publicly available datasets: the **Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM)** and the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer (Diagnostics) (WBC)** dataset. This is a strong indication that these datasets will be detailed further in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **dataset preparation section** (Section III) where the authors provide specific details about the datasets used. Here, they describe the DDSM dataset as a public database of digital mammograms containing both normal and abnormal images, and they specify that it consists of 43 volumes of mammogram samples. They also mention the WBC dataset, which contains 30 features extracted from breast mass Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) samples.

In the **table provided in Section III**, the authors summarize the dataset setups, including the number of positive and negative samples for the DDSM dataset, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for both datasets:

1. For the **Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM)**, the citation is:
   > Heath, M., Bowyer, K., Kopans, D., Kegelmeyer Jr, P., Moore, R., Chang, K., and Munishkumaran, S. (1998). Current status of the digital database for screening mammography. In Digital Mammography: Nijmegen, 1998 (pp. 457-460). Dordrecht: Springer Netherlands.

2. For the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer (Diagnostics) (WBC)** dataset, the citation is:
   > Wolberg, W. H., Street, W. N., and Mangasarian, O. L. (1992). Breast cancer Wisconsin (diagnostic) data set. UCI Machine Learning Repository [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/].

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
