To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PhysioGAN: Training High Fidelity Generative Model for Physiological Sensor Readings" by Moustafa Alzantot et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model using two real-world datasets: one for ECG classification and another for activity recognition from motion sensors. This suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will look for the names, characteristics, and any relevant details about the datasets.

1. **AFib Classification Dataset**: The authors mention that this dataset is from Yıldırım et al. (2018) and contains 1000 fragments of ECG signals from 45 individuals, focusing on two classes: Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR) and Atrial Fibrillation (AFib). Each segment corresponds to 10 seconds of ECG data recorded at a sampling rate of 300 Hz.

2. **Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Dataset**: The authors refer to the HAR dataset from Anguita et al. (2013), which includes 10,299 examples collected from smartphones worn by 30 volunteers performing six different activities. The dataset is split into training and test sets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **AFib Classification Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yıldırım, Ö., Pławiak, P., Tan, R.-S., & Acharya, U. R. (2018). Arrhythmia detection using deep convolutional neural network with long duration ECG signals. *Computers in Biology and Medicine*, 102, 411-420.

- For the **HAR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Anguita, D., Ghio, A., Oneto, L., Parra, X., & Reyes-Ortiz, J. L. (2013). A public domain dataset for human activity recognition using smartphones. In *Esann*.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include all relevant details and citations for each dataset as I prepare the final structured output.
