To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-time FPGA Design for OMP Targeting 8K Image Reconstruction" by Jiayao Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the implementation of reconstruction algorithms and mentions performance metrics, but it does not explicitly name any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the experiments. The introduction primarily discusses the theoretical background of Compressed Sensing and the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm, but it does not specify any datasets.

I will then focus on the **experimental results section**. In **section 4.1 (Design Details)**, the authors mention using **200 images with the size of 320x480** from the **BSD 500 dataset** for quality comparison with Gaussian matrices. This is a clear indication of a dataset used in their experiments.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the BSD 500 dataset, I will check the **References section**. The BSD 500 dataset is cited as follows:
> Martin, D., Fowlkes, C., Tal, D., & Malik, J. (2001). *A database of human segmented natural images and its application to evaluating segmentation algorithms and measuring ecological statistics*. In Proceedings Eighth IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV 2001), vol. 2, pp. 416-423. IEEE.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **BSD 500 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 500 images that are human-segmented, used for evaluating segmentation algorithms and measuring ecological statistics.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation is included for the BSD 500 dataset.
