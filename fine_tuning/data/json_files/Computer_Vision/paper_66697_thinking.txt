To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adapting Segment Anything Model (SAM) through Prompt-based Learning for Enhanced Protein Identification in Cryo-EM Micrographs" by Fei He et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **CryoPPP dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically **section 2.5 (CryoPPP dataset and Metrics)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They describe the **CryoPPP dataset** as encompassing a diverse set of 27 protein types, consisting of **6,893 high-resolution micrographs**, each annotated with protein coordinates. This section confirms the dataset's significance in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **CryoPPP dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Dhakal, Ashwin, et al. "A large expert-curated cryo-EM image dataset for machine learning protein particle picking." *Scientific Data* 10.1 (2023): 392.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **CryoPPP Dataset**: This dataset is essential for validating the proposed prompt-based learning methods. It includes 6,893 high-resolution micrographs of 27 different protein types, with annotations for protein coordinates.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
