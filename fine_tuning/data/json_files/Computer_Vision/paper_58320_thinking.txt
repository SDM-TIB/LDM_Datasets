To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ERA-Solver: Error-Robust Adams Solver for Fast Sampling of Diffusion Probabilistic Models" by Shengmeng Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on **Cifar10, LSUN-Church, and LSUN-Bedroom datasets**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the study.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Cifar10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, commonly used for image classification tasks.
2. **LSUN-Church**: A dataset containing images of churches, used for various image generation tasks.
3. **LSUN-Bedroom**: Similar to LSUN-Church, this dataset contains images of bedrooms, also used for image generation tasks.
4. **Celeba**: A dataset with images of celebrity faces, often used for tasks involving facial recognition and generation.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Cifar10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Nair, V., & Hinton, G. (2009). CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research). URL: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

- For **LSUN-Church**, the citation is:
  > Yu, F., Seff, A., Zhang, Y., Song, S., Funkhouser, T., & Xiao, J. (2015). LSUN: Construction of a large-scale image dataset using deep learning with humans in the loop. arXiv:1506.03365.

- For **LSUN-Bedroom**, the citation is the same as LSUN-Church since they are part of the same dataset collection:
  > Yu, F., Seff, A., Zhang, Y., Song, S., Funkhouser, T., & Xiao, J. (2015). LSUN: Construction of a large-scale image dataset using deep learning with humans in the loop. arXiv:1506.03365.

- For **Celeba**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). Deep learning face attributes in the wild. In Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or citations.
