To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Adapting Noise-Contrastive Estimation for Energy-Based Models" by Nathaniel Xu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract typically provides a concise overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets. If the authors discuss their experiments or evaluations, they may name specific datasets that were used. 

Next, I will focus on **Chapter 5 (Experiments & Results)**, as this section usually contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any subsections that describe the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, I notice that the author mentions three datasets:
1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits, commonly used for training various image processing systems.
2. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, widely used for machine learning and computer vision tasks.
3. **CelebA**: A large-scale face attributes dataset with more than 200,000 celebrity images, each with 40 attribute labels.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

The full citations I will extract are:
- For **MNIST**:
  > Deng, L. (2012). The MNIST database of handwritten digit images for machine learning research. *IEEE Signal Processing Magazine*, 29(6), 141-142.

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Krizhevsky, A. (2012). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. *University of Toronto*.

- For **CelebA**:
  > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., et al. (2015). Deep learning face attributes in the wild. In *Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)*.

Finally, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the documentation process.
