To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pointwise Convergence of Fourier Series and Deep Neural Network for the Indicator Function of D-Dimensional Ball" by Ryota Kawasumi and Tsuyoshi Yoneda, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the theoretical aspects of deep neural networks and Fourier series but do not reference any datasets. I will continue to the subsequent sections.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (The Fourier series case)** and **section 3 (The specific deep neural network case)**. These sections focus on theoretical discussions and do not mention any datasets either. 

I will then check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. However, the references primarily consist of theoretical papers and do not indicate any specific datasets used in the experiments.

Since the paper does not provide any explicit datasets or mention any datasets used for experiments, I conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

In summary, I will note that no datasets were identified in this research paper, and therefore, there are no citations to provide. 

This process highlights the importance of thoroughly reviewing all relevant sections of a paper to ensure that any datasets are not overlooked, even if they are not explicitly mentioned in the abstract or introduction.
