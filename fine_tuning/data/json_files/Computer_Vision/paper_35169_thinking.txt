To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Limitations of First-Order Approximation in GAN Dynamics" by Jerry Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I will need to look deeper into the paper for specific dataset references.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where datasets are typically discussed. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments involving a specific model (GMM-GAN) and its dynamics. I will look for any mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not explicitly mention any standard datasets like CIFAR-10 or MNIST, which are common in GAN research. Instead, they focus on a theoretical model and its dynamics without referencing external datasets. However, they do mention using simulated data generated from Gaussian distributions for their experiments.

Since there are no external datasets cited, I will note that the authors used synthetic data generated from their model rather than established datasets. This is important to document as it reflects the nature of their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if any foundational datasets or related works are cited that might imply the use of datasets. However, the references primarily focus on theoretical aspects and previous GAN works without specific datasets.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings as follows:

1. **Synthetic Data from GMM-GAN**: The authors used synthetic data generated from their GMM-GAN model for their experiments. This is not a standard dataset but rather data created specifically for the purpose of their research.

Since there are no formal datasets to cite, I will note the absence of traditional datasets and emphasize the use of synthetic data in the context of their experiments. This will be crucial for understanding the experimental setup and results presented in the paper.
