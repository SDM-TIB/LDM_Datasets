To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Hyperbolic-to-Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Network" by Jindou Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted, which suggests that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in the context of link prediction and node classification tasks. Specifically, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets and their characteristics.

Upon reviewing the text, I find that the authors explicitly mention the following datasets:

1. **DISEASE Dataset**: This dataset is constructed by simulating the SIR disease spreading model, where the label of a node indicates whether the node was infected or not, and the feature of a node indicates the susceptibility of the node to the disease.

2. **CORA Dataset**: This is a citation network dataset where nodes represent scientific papers and edges represent citation links. It contains 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, and 1,433 features per node, with 7 classes of machine learning papers.

3. **PUBMED Dataset**: Another citation network dataset, which contains 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, and 500 features per node, categorized into 3 classes of medicine publications.

4. **AIRPORT Dataset**: This dataset represents a flight network where nodes are airports and edges represent airline routes. It consists of 2,236 nodes, with the label of a node indicating the population of the country where the airport is located.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

- For the **DISEASE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ines Chami, Zhitao Ying, Christopher Ré, and Jure Leskovec. *Hyperbolic graph convolutional neural networks*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), pages 4868–4879, 2019.

- For the **CORA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Prithviraj Sen, Galileo Namata, Mustafa Bilgic, Lise Getoor, Brian Galligher, and Tina Eliassi-Rad. *Collective classification in network data*. AI magazine, 29(3):93–93, 2008.

- For the **PUBMED Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Karsten M Borgwardt, Cheng Soon Ong, Stefan Schönauer, SVN Vishwanathan, Alex J Smola, and Hans-Peter Kriegel. *Protein function prediction via graph kernels*. Bioinformatics, 21(suppl 1):i47–i56, 2005.

- For the **AIRPORT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ines Chami, Zhitao Ying, Christopher Ré, and Jure Leskovec. *Hyperbolic graph convolutional neural networks*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), pages 4868–4879, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations for future reference.
