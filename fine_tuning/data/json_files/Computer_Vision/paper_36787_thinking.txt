To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sparse Autoencoder for Unsupervised Nucleus Detection and Representation in Histopathology Images" by Le Hou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The authors state that they evaluate their method on four datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments sections** to gather more context about these datasets. In the introduction, the authors discuss the challenges of collecting large-scale supervised datasets and hint at the datasets used for their experiments.

I will then navigate to **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used. They mention four datasets:

1. **Unsupervised Learning Dataset**: This dataset consists of 0.5 million unlabeled small images cropped from 400 lung adenocarcinoma histopathology images obtained from the public TCGA repository. The images are 100×100 pixels in size at 20X magnification.

2. **Lymphocyte Classification Dataset**: This dataset contains 23,356 images labeled as lymphocyte-rich or not, cropped from lung adenocarcinoma tissue images in the TCGA dataset. Each image is 300×300 pixels at 20X magnification.

3. **Individual Lymphocyte Classification Dataset**: This dataset includes 1,785 images of individual objects labeled as lymphocyte or non-lymphocyte, cropped from 12 representative lung adenocarcinoma whole slide tissue images from the TCGA repository.

4. **Nuclear Shape and Attribute Classification Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,000 images of nuclei labeled with fifteen morphology attributes and shapes.

5. **MICCAI 2015 Nucleus Segmentation Challenge Dataset**: This dataset contains 15 training images and 18 testing images, with ground truth masks of nuclei provided in the training dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The TCGA repository is referenced as a source for multiple datasets, and I will ensure to include the relevant citations for the datasets that are derived from it.

The citations I will include are:

- For the TCGA repository:
  > The Cancer Genome Atlas. *https://cancergenome.nih.gov/*.

- For the dataset used for nuclear shape and attribute classification, I will refer to the original paper cited in the text:
  > Murthy, V., Hou, L., Samaras, D., Kurc, T. M., & Saltz, J. H. (2017). Center-focusing multi-task CNN with injected features for classification of glioma nuclear images. In *Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)*.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
