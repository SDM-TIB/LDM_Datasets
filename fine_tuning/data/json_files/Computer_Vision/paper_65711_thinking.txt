To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DREAMCRAFT3D: HIERARCHICAL 3D GENERATION WITH BOOTSTRAPPED DIFFUSION PRIOR" by Jingxiang Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I will focus on the introduction and experiments for detailed information about datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of 3D content creation and mention the need for extensive 3D data. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention establishing a test benchmark that includes **300 images**, which consist of a mix of real pictures and those produced by Stable Diffusion and Deep Floyd. This indicates that they have created a dataset for their experiments.

The authors also mention that each image in this benchmark comes with an alpha mask for the foreground, a predicted depth map, and a text prompt. This provides additional context about the dataset's structure and content.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the following works related to the datasets:

1. **Stable Diffusion**: 
   > Rombach, R., Blattmann, A., Lorenz, D., Esser, P., & Ommer, B. (2021). High-resolution image synthesis with latent diffusion models.

2. **Deep Floyd**: 
   > Shonenkov, A., Konstantinov, M., Bakshandaeva, D., Schuhmann, C., Ivanova, K., & Klokova, N. (2023). DeepFloyd IF: A modular cascaded diffusion model. Retrieved from https://github.com/deep-floyd/IF/tree/develop.

Since the authors created a benchmark dataset from these sources, I will note that the dataset is a combination of images generated from these models, rather than a standalone dataset with a specific citation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets:

- **Dataset Name**: Test Benchmark Dataset
  - **Description**: A dataset consisting of 300 images, including real pictures and those generated by Stable Diffusion and Deep Floyd. Each image includes an alpha mask for the foreground, a predicted depth map, and a text prompt.
  - **Citations**:
    - Rombach et al. (2021). High-resolution image synthesis with latent diffusion models.
    - Shonenkov et al. (2023). DeepFloyd IF: A modular cascaded diffusion model.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
