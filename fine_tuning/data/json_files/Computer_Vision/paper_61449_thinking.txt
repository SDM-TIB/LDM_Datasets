To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Multi-task Learning for End-to-end Metaphor Detection" by Shenglong Zhang and Ying Liu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors report competitive results on four public datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, they mention four metaphor detection datasets:

1. **VUA All**: This dataset is the largest metaphor detection dataset, containing sentences from four genres: academic, conversation, fiction, and news. It labels each word in a sentence for metaphorical usage.

2. **VUA Verb**: A subset of the VUA All dataset, focusing specifically on verb targets.

3. **MOH-X**: This dataset is sampled from WordNet and includes only verb targets, which may have metaphorical senses.

4. **TroFi**: Collected from the Wall Street Journal Corpus, this dataset also focuses on verb targets and was created using an unsupervised method.

Additionally, the authors mention a dataset for basic sense discrimination (BSD) created from **SemCor**, which is the largest manually annotated dataset for word sense disambiguation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **VUA All** and **VUA Verb**, the citation is:
  > Steen, G. (2010). A method for linguistic metaphor identification: From MIP to MIPVU. John Benjamins Publishing.

- For **MOH-X**, the citation is:
  > Mohammad, S., Shutova, E., & Turney, P. (2016). Metaphor as a medium for emotion: An empirical study. In Proceedings of the Fifth Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics, pages 23–33, Berlin, Germany. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **TroFi**, the citation is:
  > Birke, J., & Sarkar, A. (2006). A clustering approach for nearly unsupervised recognition of nonliteral language. In 11th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 329–336, Trento, Italy. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **SemCor**, the citation is:

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that all relevant datasets are accurately captured and cited.
