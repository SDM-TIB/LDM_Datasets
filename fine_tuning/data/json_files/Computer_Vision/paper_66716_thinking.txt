To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Multi-Pattern Normalities in the Frequency Domain for Efficient Time Series Anomaly Detection" by Feiyi Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference specific datasets. I will look for any statements that indicate the use of datasets for evaluating their proposed method.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any subsections that detail the datasets used for testing the proposed method. This section typically provides the most comprehensive information about the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant statistics.

From the provided text, I can identify the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Server Machine Dataset (SMD)**: This dataset spans a 5-week period and originates from a major Internet company, incorporating data from 28 distinct machines. The anomaly ratio in SMD is 4.16%.

2. **J-D1 Dataset**: This dataset includes logs of 19 metrics from 30 services, with an anomaly ratio of 5.25%.

3. **J-D2 Dataset**: Similar to J-D1, this dataset also includes logs from 30 services, but with a higher anomaly ratio of 20.26%.

4. **Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)**: This dataset comprises real spacecraft telemetry data and anomalies from the Soil Moisture Active Passive satellite, featuring an anomaly ratio of 13.13%.

5. **MC Dataset**: This dataset consists of monitoring data from 25 services over 15 days, with an anomaly ratio of 3.6%.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Based on the information provided in the paper, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
