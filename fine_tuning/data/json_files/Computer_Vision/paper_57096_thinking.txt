To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FLNeRF: 3D Facial Landmarks Estimation in Neural Radiance Fields" by Hao Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors will make an "augmented dataset with 110 expressions" available, which indicates that a dataset is indeed involved. I will note this down as it suggests the presence of a dataset that is central to their research.

Next, I will examine the **related work** section to see if any datasets are referenced that may have been used in previous studies. This could provide context or additional datasets that are relevant to the current work.

Moving on to the **experiments** section, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation. The authors mention "FaceScape" as a dataset in the context of their work, specifically stating that it consists of 20 basic expressions and that they augment this dataset to create their own. This is a crucial point as it indicates the source of their data.

In the **data augmentation** section, the authors describe how they augment the FaceScape dataset to create a more diverse set of expressions. They mention that they generate 110 expressions from the original dataset. This is important for understanding the dataset's composition and its application in their model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the FaceScape dataset. The relevant citation is:
> Hao Zhu, Haotian Yang, Longwei Guo, Yidi Zhang, Yanru Wang, Mingkai Huang, Qiu Shen, Ruigang Yang, and Xun Cao. *Facescape: 3D facial dataset and benchmark for single-view 3D face reconstruction*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.01082, 2021.

Since the authors also mention that their augmented dataset will be made available, I will note that this dataset is derived from FaceScape but does not have a separate citation yet, as it is a product of their own work.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets I have identified:
1. **FaceScape Dataset**: This dataset is the primary source for the authors' work, consisting of 20 basic expressions, which they augment to create a dataset of 110 expressions for training their model.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
