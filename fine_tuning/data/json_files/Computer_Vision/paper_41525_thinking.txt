To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Human Body is a Black Box”: Supporting Clinical Decision-Making with Deep Learning by Mark Sendak et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Case Study: Sepsis Watch)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the development and evaluation of the Sepsis Watch tool. In this section, the authors mention curating local electronic health record (EHR) data to understand the problem and build relevant data elements for training the machine learning model. They state that the model development and evaluation dataset contained over 32 million data points, which indicates a substantial dataset.

I will also look for any specific names or references to datasets within the text. If the authors mention any publicly available datasets or specific studies that contributed data, I will note those as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the study.

In this case, the primary dataset mentioned is the local EHR data used for the Sepsis Watch model. Since it is not a publicly available dataset, I will note that it is specific to the local quaternary academic hospital where the study was conducted.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper itself, as well as any relevant details about the dataset used in the study.

The citation for the paper is:

With this information, I will be ready to create entries for the datasets in the required format.
