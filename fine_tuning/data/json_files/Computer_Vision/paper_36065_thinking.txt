To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Binary Residual Representations for Domain-specific Video Streaming" by Yi-Hsuan Tsai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on several benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are present. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will move to the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using the **KITTI dataset** and three video game datasets: **Assassins Creed**, **Skyrim**, and **Borderlands**. I will note down these names and any relevant details provided about them.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors provide a table (Table 2) that summarizes the number of videos and frames for each dataset. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope and scale.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. **KITTI Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3354â€“3361, 2012.

2. **Assassins Creed**: This dataset is typically associated with the game itself, and specific citation details may not be available in the paper. However, I will note that it is a popular video game dataset used for video compression experiments.

3. **Skyrim**: Similar to Assassins Creed, this dataset is derived from the game, and specific citation details may not be provided. I will acknowledge it as a commonly used dataset in video processing research.

4. **Borderlands**: Again, this dataset is linked to the game, and specific citation details may not be available. I will treat it similarly to the other game datasets.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations where available and clearly indicate the datasets derived from video games without specific citations.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset.
