To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data is Overrated: Perceptual Metrics Can Lead Learning in the Absence of Training Data" by Tashi Namgyal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of perceptual metrics and mentions training on uniform noise and a music dataset, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will examine the **Methods section**, particularly the **Data subsection**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training and testing. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **MusicCaps Dataset**: This dataset consists of 10-second music clips with human-generated captions. It is used for training the autoencoder on mel-spectrograms.

2. **Perceived Music Quality Dataset (PMQD)**: This dataset contains 195 reference music clips, which are used for testing the model's performance in reconstructing audio from mel-spectrograms.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

For the **MusicCaps Dataset**, the citation is:
> MusicCaps Dataset. Available at: https://research.google/resources/datasets/musicaps

For the **Perceived Music Quality Dataset (PMQD)**, the citation is:
> A. Hilmkil, C. Thom√©, and A. Arpteg. *Perceiving music quality with gans*. In Proc. Northern Lights Deep Learning Workshop (NLDL), 2020. Available at: https://github.com/carlthome/pmqd

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations for future use or analysis.
