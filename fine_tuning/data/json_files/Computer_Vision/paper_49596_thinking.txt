To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "DECA: Deep viewpoint-Equivariant human pose estimation using Capsule Autoencoders" by Nicola Garau et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the research, but the experiments section is likely to contain specific details about the datasets used.

In **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **ITOP Dataset**: This dataset contains depth images from top and front views, with a training split of 40,000 images and a test split of 10,000 images. It features 15 videos of 20 actors recorded using two Axus Xtion Pro cameras, and the 3D skeleton model consists of 15 joints.

2. **PanopTOP31K Dataset**: This dataset consists of 34,000 top-view and 34,000 front-view images from video sequences of 24 different actors, totaling 68,000 images. The ground truth 3D skeleton consists of 19 joints.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **ITOP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Albert Haque, Boya Peng, Zelun Luo, Alexandre Alahi, Serena Yeung, and Li Fei-Fei. *Towards viewpoint invariant 3D human pose estimation*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 160–177. Springer, 2016.

- For the **PanopTOP31K Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nicola Garau, Giulia Martinelli, Piotr Bródka, Niccolò Bisagno, and Nicola Conci. *Panoptop: a framework for generating viewpoint-invariant human pose estimation datasets*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops, 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
