To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Computer‚Äêaided Recognition and Assessment of a Porous Bioelastomer on Ultrasound Images for Regenerative Medicine Applications," I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a computer-aided method for analyzing ultrasound images of biodegradable elastic scaffolds, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these images.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the **ultrasound image acquisition** subsection. Here, the authors describe using a high-frequency ultrasound scanner (Vevo 2100) to capture images of a poly(carbonate urethane) urea bioelastomer implanted in a rat. They mention that the images were collected over a period of 12 weeks, which indicates a time-series dataset of ultrasound images.

In the **results section**, the authors present findings related to the analysis of texture features extracted from the ultrasound images. They mention two groups of regions of interest (ROIs) for texture feature extraction, which implies that the dataset includes specific ROIs within the ultrasound images.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets used. The paper references previous studies that may have datasets relevant to the analysis of ultrasound images and texture features. However, it does not explicitly provide a separate dataset citation.

Based on the information gathered, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Ultrasound Image Dataset**: This dataset consists of ultrasound images of a poly(carbonate urethane) urea bioelastomer implanted in a rat, collected over a 12-week period. The images were analyzed for contour extraction and texture feature analysis.

2. **Texture Feature Dataset**: This dataset includes statistical features extracted from the ultrasound images, specifically first-order and second-order statistical features calculated from the ROIs within the images.

Since the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets, I will note that the ultrasound image dataset is derived from the experimental setup described in the methods section, and the texture feature dataset is based on the analysis performed in the results section.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
