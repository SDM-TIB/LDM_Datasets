To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Classification by Re-generation-Towards Classification Based on Variational Inference" by Shideh Rezaeifar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and the need for better classification methods, but they do not specify any datasets yet. I will continue to the **experimental results section**.

In **section IV (Experimental Results)**, the authors mention using the **MNIST** and **Fashion-MNIST** datasets for their experiments. They describe how these datasets are commonly known and tested for classification and generation tasks. This is a clear indication that these datasets are integral to their research.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The MNIST dataset is widely recognized, and its citation is:

- **MNIST Dataset**:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

The Fashion-MNIST dataset is also well-known, and its citation is:

- **Fashion-MNIST Dataset**:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Ludwig Van der Maaten. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. 2017. Available: https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **MNIST Dataset** - A dataset of handwritten digits.
2. **Fashion-MNIST Dataset** - A dataset of fashion items for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

I will ensure to include the full citations for both datasets in the final output.
