To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UNIAA: A Unified Multi-modal Image Aesthetic Assessment Baseline and Benchmark" by Zhaokun Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a framework that includes a benchmark named **UNIAA-Bench** and mentions the construction of datasets for aesthetic assessment. This suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will look into the **related work** section, where the authors discuss various datasets used in Image Aesthetic Assessment (IAA). They mention several datasets, including:

1. **AVA (Aesthetic Visual Analysis)**: This dataset is noted for its popularity and includes aesthetic scores and comments.
2. **Aesthetics and Attributes Database (AADB)**: This dataset contains subjective aesthetic scores and attributes.
3. **Photo Critique Captioning Dataset (PCCD)**: This dataset is designed for generating captions based on photo aesthetics.
4. **TAD66K**: An extensive dataset encompassing various subjects.
5. **Personalized Image Aesthetics Database (PARA)**: This dataset includes both objective and subjective attributes related to aesthetics.
6. **ICAA17K**: A dataset comprising images capturing popular color combinations.

In the **methodology** section, the authors describe their **IAA Datasets Conversion Paradigm (IDCP)**, which utilizes these datasets to create a unified format for training their model. This section provides further confirmation of the datasets being used.

I will then check the **experiments** section to see if the authors provide any additional details about the datasets used for their experiments. They mention that they selected five open-source mainstream IAA datasets: **AVA, AADB, ICAA17K, PARA, and PCCD**. This confirms the datasets that are integral to their research.

Finally, I will refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

- **AVA**: 
  > Naila Murray, Luca Marchesotti, and Florent Perronnin. *AVA: A large-scale database for aesthetic visual analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2408–2415, 2012.

  > Shuai He, Yongchang Zhang, Rui Xie, Dongxiang Jiang, and Anlong Ming. *Personalized Image Aesthetics*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 638–647, 2017.

- **PARA**: 
  > Yuzhe Yang, Liwu Xu, Leida Li, Nan Qie, Yaqian Li, Peng Zhang, and Yandong Guo. *Personalized Image Aesthetics Assessment With Rich Attributes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 19861–19869, 2022.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
