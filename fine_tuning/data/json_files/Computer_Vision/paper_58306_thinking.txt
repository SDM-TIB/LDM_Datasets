To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accelerating Guided Diffusion Sampling with Splitting Numerical Methods" by Suttisak Wizadwongsa and Supasorn Suwajanakorn, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their studies. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **ImageNet dataset** for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its relevance to the study and any specific configurations or subsets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For the **ImageNet dataset**, the citation is:
> Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

In summary, I will ensure that I have accurately extracted the dataset information, including its name, description, and full citation, to maintain the integrity of the research documentation.
