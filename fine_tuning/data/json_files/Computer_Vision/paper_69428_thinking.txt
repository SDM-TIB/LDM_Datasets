To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion-ES: Gradient-free Planning with Diffusion for Autonomous Driving and Zero-Shot Instruction Following," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that Diffusion-ES achieves state-of-the-art performance on **nuPlan**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in their experiments. The introduction further emphasizes the use of nuPlan as a benchmark for evaluating their method.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in detail in **section 4 (Experiments)**. Here, they explicitly state that they evaluate their model on the **nuPlan** benchmark, which is a closed-loop planning benchmark for autonomous driving.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the nuPlan dataset. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and understanding the dataset's context. The relevant citation for the nuPlan dataset is:

> Holger Caesar, Juraj Kabzan, Kok Seang Tan, Whye Kit Fong, Eric Wolff, Alex Lang, Luke Fletcher, Oscar Beijbom, and Sammy Omari. *Nuplan: A closed-loop ML-based planning benchmark for autonomous vehicles*. 2022.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the nuPlan dataset, I will ensure to document it thoroughly. 

Now, I will compile the dataset information, including the dataset name, description, and full citation, into a structured format for clarity and future reference. 

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify potential datasets.
2. Look for explicit mentions of datasets in the methodology and experiments sections.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references section for proper documentation.

The only dataset identified in this paper is the **nuPlan** dataset, and I will ensure to include its full citation in my final output.
