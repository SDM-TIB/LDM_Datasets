To extract datasets from the research paper titled "High-Fidelity Synthesis with Disentangled Representation" by Wonkwang Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of the **CelebA-HQ dataset** for generating high-resolution images, which indicates that this dataset is relevant to the research. The introduction may provide additional context or mention other datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments and the datasets used. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as they often provide concise information.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **dSprites Dataset**: This dataset consists of 737,280 binary images of 2D sprites with five ground-truth factors, including shape, scale, orientation, and position. The paper references it as a foundational dataset for evaluating disentanglement learning.

2. **Color-dSprites Dataset**: This is a variant of the dSprites dataset where the sprites are filled with random colors. It is used to assess the model's ability to handle color variations.

3. **Noisy-dSprites Dataset**: Another variant of the dSprites dataset, where the background is filled with random uniform noise, testing the robustness of the model against noise.

4. **Scream-dSprites Dataset**: This dataset replaces the background of the dSprites images with a randomly cropped patch from Edvard Munch's painting "The Scream," adding complexity to the evaluation.

5. **CelebA Dataset**: A large-scale dataset containing 202,599 RGB images of celebrity faces, which includes various attributes and is used for training and evaluating generative models.

6. **CelebA-HQ Dataset**: A high-resolution subset of the CelebA dataset, consisting of 30,000 RGB images at 1024x1024 resolution, used for high-fidelity image synthesis.

7. **3D Chairs Dataset**: This dataset contains 86,366 RGB images of chair CAD models, used to evaluate the model's performance on 3D object representations.

8. **Cars Dataset**: A dataset with 16,185 RGB images of cars, used to assess the model's ability to generate realistic images of vehicles.

After identifying these datasets, I will now gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

- **dSprites Dataset**:

  > Jonathan Krause, Michael Stark, Jia Deng, and Li Fei-Fei. *3D object representations for fine-grained categorization*. In 4th International IEEE Workshop on 3D Representation and Recognition (3dRR-13), 2013.

The Color-dSprites and Noisy-dSprites datasets are variations of the dSprites dataset and do not have separate citations, as they are derived from the original dataset.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
