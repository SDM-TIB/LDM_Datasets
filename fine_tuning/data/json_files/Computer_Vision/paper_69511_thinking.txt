To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking Graph Masked Autoencoders through Alignment and Uniformity" by Liang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that "Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over existing state-of-the-art methods." This indicates that datasets are likely discussed in the experiments section.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. They mention using **nine node classification datasets** and **six graph classification datasets**. I will list these datasets and gather specific details about each one.

In **subsection 5.1 (Evaluation Setups)**, the authors provide a comprehensive list of the datasets used for node classification, which includes:

1. **Cora**: A dataset with 2,708 nodes, 5,278 edges, 7 classes, and 1,433 features.
2. **Citeseer**: A dataset with 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, 6 classes, and 3,703 features.
3. **Pubmed**: A dataset with 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, 3 classes, and 500 features.
4. **Ogbn-arxiv**: A dataset with 169,343 nodes, 1,166,243 edges, 40 classes, and 767 features.
5. **PPI**: A dataset with 56,944 nodes, 818,736 edges, 121 classes, and 50 features.
6. **Reddit**: A dataset with 232,965 nodes, 11,606,919 edges, 41 classes, and 602 features.
7. **Cora-full**: A dataset with 19,793 nodes, 126,842 edges, 70 classes, and 8,710 features.
8. **Flickr**: A dataset with 89,250 nodes, 899,756 edges, 7 classes, and 500 features.
9. **WikiCS**: A dataset with 11,701 nodes, 431,726 edges, 10 classes, and 300 features.

For graph classification, the authors mention:

1. **IMDB-B**: 1,000 graphs, 2 classes, average 19.8 nodes, average 96.5 edges.
2. **IMDB-M**: 1,500 graphs, 3 classes, average 13.0 nodes, average 65.9 edges.
3. **PROTEINS**: 1,113 graphs, 2 classes, average 39.1 nodes, average 72.8 edges.
4. **COLLAB**: 5,000 graphs, 3 classes, average 74.5 nodes, average 2,457.5 edges.
5. **MUTAG**: 188 graphs, 2 classes, average 17.9 nodes, average 19.8 edges.
6. **REDDIT-B**: 2,000 graphs, 2 classes, average 429.7 nodes, average 497.8 edges.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing.
