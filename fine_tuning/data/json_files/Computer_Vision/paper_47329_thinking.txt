To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EADNet: Efficient Asymmetric Dilated Network for Semantic Segmentation" by Qihang Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that their experimental results are based on the **Cityscapes dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly the **Experiments** section. In this section, the authors explicitly state that they evaluated their method on the **Cityscapes dataset** and also mention the **CamVid dataset**. This suggests that both datasets are important for their experiments.

Now, I will gather detailed descriptions of these datasets:

1. **Cityscapes Dataset**: The authors reference this dataset as a benchmark for semantic segmentation, noting that their proposed EADNet achieves a segmentation mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 67.1% on this dataset.

2. **CamVid Dataset**: The authors also evaluate their method on the CamVid dataset, reporting a competitive mIoU of 68.3%. This indicates that the CamVid dataset is also significant for their research.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Cityscapes dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. "The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding." 2016.

- For the **CamVid dataset**, the citation is:
  > Vijay Badrinarayanan, Alex Kendall, and Roberto Cipolla. "SegNet: A Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Image Segmentation." IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 39, no. 12, pp. 2481â€“2495, 2017.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
