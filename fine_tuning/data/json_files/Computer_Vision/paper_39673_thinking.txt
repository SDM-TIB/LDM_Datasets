To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Atom Responding Machine for Dialog Generation" by Ganbin Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experiments are conducted on a dataset collected from Tencent Weibo, which indicates that a dataset is indeed involved. I will note this down as a potential dataset.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiment Process)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Dataset Details)**, where the authors provide explicit details about the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of 815,852 post-response pairs, with 775,852 for training and 40,000 for validation. They also state that 300 posts were randomly sampled for testing, which are not included in the training and validation sets. This section confirms the dataset's existence and provides key details about its structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors refer to the dataset as being collected from Tencent Weibo, but I need to ensure I have the correct citation format. Since the dataset is not attributed to a specific paper or publication, I will note it as follows:

- **Tencent Weibo Dataset**: This dataset is collected from Tencent Weibo and contains 815,852 post-response pairs. The citation can be formatted as:
  > Tencent Weibo. *Dataset for dialogue generation*. Available at: http://t.qq.com/?lang=en US.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, including its name, description, and citation, ensuring that I adhere to the required format.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and completeness.
