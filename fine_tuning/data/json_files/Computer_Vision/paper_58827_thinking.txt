To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Open-domain Visual Entity Recognition: Towards Recognizing Millions of Wikipedia Entities" by Hexiang Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the construction of the **OVEN-Wiki dataset**, which is a key dataset for the proposed task. This indicates that I should look for details about this dataset in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on the **section 3 (The OVEN-Wiki dataset)**, where the authors provide a comprehensive description of how the dataset was created. They mention that the OVEN-Wiki dataset is constructed by repurposing **14 existing datasets** and grounding their labels to Wikipedia entities. This section will likely contain the specific datasets that were combined to create OVEN-Wiki.

In this section, the authors list the **14 existing datasets** used to construct OVEN-Wiki, which include:

1. **ImageNet21k-P**: A large-scale image classification dataset.
2. **iNaturalist2017**: A dataset for species classification.
3. **Cars196**: A dataset for fine-grained classification of car models.
4. **SUN397**: A scene recognition dataset.
5. **Food101**: A dataset for food classification.
6. **Sports100**: A dataset for sports image classification.
7. **Aircraft**: A dataset for aircraft classification.
8. **Oxford Flower**: A dataset for flower classification.
9. **Google Landmarks v2**: A dataset for landmark recognition.
10. **VQA v2**: A visual question answering dataset.
11. **Visual7W**: A dataset for grounded question answering in images.
12. **Visual Genome**: A dataset that connects language and vision.
13. **OK-VQA**: A visual question answering benchmark requiring external knowledge.
14. **Text-VQA**: A dataset for visual question answering that requires reading text in images.

I will also note that the authors provide a detailed explanation of how they linked the labels from these datasets to Wikipedia entities, which is crucial for understanding the OVEN-Wiki dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of the datasets mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate these datasets.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for downstream processing or review.
