To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Relational Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Vinicius Zambaldi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a novel navigation and planning task called **Box-World** and the **StarCraft II Learning Environment**, which suggests that these may be datasets or environments used in the experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In section 4.1, the authors describe the **Box-World** task, which is a procedurally generated environment rather than a traditional dataset. However, they mention that the environment will be made publicly available online, which is important for citation purposes.

In section 4.2, the authors discuss the **StarCraft II mini-games**, which are also not traditional datasets but rather environments used for training agents. They specify that these mini-games were developed for the **StarCraft II Learning Environment (SC2LE)**, which is a recognized benchmark in reinforcement learning.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to these environments. The authors reference the **StarCraft II Learning Environment** in their citations, specifically:

- For the **StarCraft II Learning Environment**, the citation is:
  > Oriol Vinyals, Timo Ewalds, Sergey Bartunov, Petko Georgiev, Alexander Sasha Vezhnevets, Michelle Yeo, Alireza Makhzani, Heinrich Küttler, John Agapiou, Julian Schrittwieser, et al. *Starcraft II: A New Challenge for Reinforcement Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.04782, 2017.

Since **Box-World** is mentioned as a task that will be made publicly available but does not have a formal citation in the references, I will note that it is an important environment for the study but lacks a specific citation.

In summary, I will document the following datasets/environments:

1. **Box-World**: A novel navigation and planning task that will be made publicly available online. No formal citation is provided.
2. **StarCraft II Learning Environment**: A suite of mini-games used for training agents in reinforcement learning.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
