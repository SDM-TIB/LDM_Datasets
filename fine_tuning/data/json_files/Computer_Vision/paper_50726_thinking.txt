To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accelerated replica exchange stochastic gradient Langevin diffusion enhanced Bayesian DeepONet for solving noisy parametric PDEs" by Guang Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of DeepONets for approximating nonlinear operators and mentions experiments on four parametric PDE problems, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors describe their experiments in detail, particularly in **section 5 (Numerical experiments)**, where they outline the four parametric PDE problems they tested their framework on. 

1. **Anti-derivative Operator**: The authors mention that they sampled the external force from a mean-zero Gaussian Random Field (GRF) with a specific covariance kernel. This indicates that the dataset consists of samples generated from this GRF.

2. **Gravity Pendulum System**: Similar to the first experiment, the authors state that the external force is also sampled from a mean-zero GRF. This suggests that the dataset for this experiment is constructed in the same manner as the first.

3. **Diffusion Reaction Equation**: The authors again mention using a GRF to generate the input samples for this experiment, indicating that the dataset is derived from this stochastic process.

4. **Advection-Diffusion System**: The authors describe the initial condition sampled from a GRF, which again indicates that the dataset is based on this stochastic process.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or the methods used to generate them. Since the datasets are derived from Gaussian Random Fields, I will look for relevant references that describe the GRF methodology.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **mean-zero Gaussian Random Field (GRF)** used in the experiments, the citation is:
  > G. Lin, Y. Wang, and Z. Zhang. *Multi-variance replica exchange stochastic gradient MCMC for inverse and forward Bayesian physics-informed neural network*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2107.06330, 2021.

Since the datasets are generated from the GRF methodology, this citation serves as the authoritative reference for the datasets used in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names and their respective citations, ensuring that all necessary information is included for future reference or processing.
