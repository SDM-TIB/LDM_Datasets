To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RL-GAN-Net: A Reinforcement Learning Agent Controlled GAN Network for Real-Time Point Cloud Shape Completion" by Muhammad Sarmad et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference existing datasets relevant to their research. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to previous works that utilized specific datasets.

In the **methods section**, particularly in subsections that describe the experimental setup, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. The authors may specify the datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in their experiments.

I will also check the **experiments section** for any results that reference specific datasets. This section often includes performance metrics and comparisons that can indicate which datasets were used.

Once I identify the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions the **ShapeNet dataset**, I would look for the citation in the references, which typically includes the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all citations are complete and correctly formatted.
