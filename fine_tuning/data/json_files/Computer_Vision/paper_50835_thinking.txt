To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating Band-Limited Adversarial Surfaces Using Neural Networks" by Roee Ben-Shlomo, Yevgeny Men, and supervised by Ido Imanuel, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the project, but the introduction is likely to contain more specific information about the datasets used.

In **section 1.2 (FAUST dataset)**, the authors explicitly mention the **FAUST dataset** as the primary dataset used in their project. They describe it as containing 10 subjects, each performing 10 different poses, and detail how they split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. This section is crucial as it provides both the name of the dataset and its characteristics.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the FAUST dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Bogo, Federica et al. (June 2014). ‘FAUST: Dataset and evaluation for 3D mesh registration’. In: Proceedings IEEE Conf. on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR). Piscataway, NJ, USA: IEEE.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will focus solely on the FAUST dataset for my extraction.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for the dataset mentioned in the paper.
