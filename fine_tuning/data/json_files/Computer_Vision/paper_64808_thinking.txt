To extract datasets from the research paper titled "High Perceptual Quality Wireless Image Delivery with Denoising Diffusion Models" by Selim F. Yilmaz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments," which suggests that datasets are likely involved, so I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of wireless image transmission and mention the use of deep learning models. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets here, so I will continue to the methodology section.

In **section 3.1 (Experimental Setup and Implementation Details)**, the authors specify that they evaluate their method on the **CelebA-HQ dataset**, which contains 30,000 high-resolution images. This is a clear identification of a dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CelebA-HQ dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Tero Karras, Timo Aila, Samuli Laine, and Jaakko Lehtinen. *Progressive growing of GANs for improved quality, stability, and variation*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2018.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **CelebA-HQ Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed method and consists of 30,000 high-resolution images.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included as required.
