To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Online Multi-Source Domain Adaptation" by Xie Renchunzi and Mahardhika Pratama, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by scanning the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I anticipate that the authors will describe the datasets used for their numerical studies in detail. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize dataset properties, as these often contain valuable information.

Upon locating the relevant section, I will extract the names and descriptions of each dataset. For instance, the paper mentions several datasets, including:

1. **Weather Dataset**: A dataset that records weather data over 50 years, capturing yearly seasonal changes and long-term climate changes.
2. **Sea Dataset**: A synthetic dataset designed to model both recurring and abrupt concept drift.
3. **Hyperplane Dataset**: A dataset used to predict the position of a hyperplane in a multi-dimensional space.
4. **KDDCup Dataset**: A dataset for network intrusion detection, simulating various network attacks.
5. **SUSY Dataset**: A large dataset containing instances related to super-symmetric particles.
6. **Hepmass Dataset**: A dataset for separating particle-producing collisions from background noise.
7. **Kitti Dataset**: A real-world dataset for 3D object detection in autonomous driving scenarios.
8. **Online Quality Classification (OQC) Dataset**: A dataset for quality detection in manufacturing processes.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, the citations might look like this:

- **Weather Dataset**:

Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
