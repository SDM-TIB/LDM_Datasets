To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-supervised Learning with Missing Values Imputation" by Buliao Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental design sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the problem being addressed and may reference datasets that are central to the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental design section** (Section VI) where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, the authors mention that they used datasets from the University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository. They list several datasets, including:

1. **Iris Dataset**: A well-known dataset for classification tasks, containing 150 samples with 4 attributes and 3 classes.
2. **Parkinsons Dataset**: Contains 195 samples with 22 attributes and 2 classes.
3. **Sonar Dataset**: Comprises 208 samples with 60 attributes and 2 classes.
4. **Ecoli Dataset**: Contains 336 samples with 7 attributes and 8 classes.
5. **Banknote Dataset**: Comprises 1372 samples with 4 attributes and 2 classes.
6. **Breast Cancer Dataset**: Contains 569 samples with 32 attributes and 2 classes.
7. **Accent Recognition Dataset**: Contains 329 samples with 12 attributes and 6 classes.
8. **WiFi Localization Dataset**: Comprises 2000 samples with 7 attributes and 4 classes.
9. **Wine White Dataset**: Contains 4898 samples with 11 attributes and 7 classes.
10. **HTRU2 Dataset**: Contains 17898 samples with 8 attributes and 2 classes.
11. **Sensorless Dataset**: Contains 58509 samples with 48 attributes and 11 classes.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the UCI machine learning repository as the source for these datasets, which is a common practice. The citation for the UCI repository is:

- **UCI Machine Learning Repository**: Asuncion, A., & Newman, D. (2007). *UCI machine learning repository*. Retrieved from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations in a structured format.

After completing this process, I will have a comprehensive list of datasets used in the paper along with their citations, ready for further analysis or processing.
