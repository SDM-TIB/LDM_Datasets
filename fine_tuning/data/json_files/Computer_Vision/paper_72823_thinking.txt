To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-Uniform Spatial Alignment Errors in sUAS Imagery From Wide-Area Disasters" by Thomas Manzini et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions a publicly available dataset of imagery, building polygons, and adjustments, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets, such as **section III (Approach)** and any other relevant sections that might describe the datasets used in the analysis. In section III, the authors mention that they used **51 orthomosaics collected from sUAS at 9 wide-area disasters** and that these orthomosaics include imagery from various disasters like Hurricane Ian, Hurricane Harvey, and others. This suggests that the dataset is related to these disasters.

I will also check for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **results** or **discussion** sections, where the authors might provide more details about the datasets used for their analysis. The paper indicates that the dataset includes **21,619 building polygons**, which is a crucial detail for the dataset description.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the **Microsoft Building Footprints Dataset**, which is used for generating building polygons. I will extract the citation for this dataset.

The citation for the **Microsoft Building Footprints Dataset** is:
> Microsoft. "Microsoft US Building Footprints." Available at: https://github.com/Microsoft/USBuildingFootprints, 2021.

Additionally, I will note that the authors mention that all imagery, building polygons, and adjustments will be released upon publication, but they do not provide a specific citation for the orthomosaic imagery dataset since it is forthcoming.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **sUAS Orthomosaic Imagery Dataset**: This dataset consists of 51 orthomosaics collected from sUAS at 9 wide-area disasters, including Hurricane Ian, Hurricane Harvey, and others. The dataset includes 21,619 building polygons and is used to analyze spatial alignment errors.

2. **Microsoft Building Footprints Dataset**: This dataset provides building polygons generated through semantic segmentation on US satellite imagery.

With this information, I will prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will allow for proper documentation and referencing of the datasets used in the research.
