To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Point Cloud Registration-Driven Robust Feature Matching for 3D Siamese Object Tracking" by Haobo Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on KITTI, NuScenes, and Waymo datasets," indicating that these datasets are used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about each dataset in the **experiments section**. The authors describe their experiments on three datasets:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: This dataset is widely used for evaluating 3D object detection and tracking algorithms in autonomous driving scenarios. The paper mentions that it includes various outdoor scenes and object categories.

2. **NuScenes Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1000 driving scenes and is also used for 3D object detection and tracking. The authors specify that they split the dataset into training and validation sequences.

3. **Waymo Dataset**: This is a large-scale dataset containing 150 scenes for testing, which is noted for its complexity and size compared to KITTI and NuScenes.

I will then check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

- For the **KITTI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2012.

- For the **NuScenes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alexander H. Lang, et al. *NuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

- For the **Waymo Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pei Sun, H. Kretzschmar, X. Dotiwalla, et al. *Scalability in perception for autonomous driving: Waymo open dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
