To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Phased Consistency Model" by Fu-Yun Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction typically elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section usually contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are highlighted by the authors.

In this paper, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **CC3M Dataset**: This dataset is used for training image generation models. It is a large-scale dataset that contains image-text pairs, which are essential for training models that generate images based on textual descriptions.

2. **WebVid-2M Dataset**: This dataset is used for training video generation models. It consists of a large collection of video clips paired with captions, making it suitable for text-to-video generation tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CC3M Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Soravit Changpinyo, Piyush Sharma, Nan Ding, and Radu Soricut. *Conceptual 12m: Pushing web-scale image-text pre-training to recognize long-tail visual concepts*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3558–3568, 2021.

- For **WebVid-2M Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Max Bain, Arsha Nagrani, Gül Varol, and Andrew Zisserman. *Frozen in time: A joint video and image encoder for end-to-end retrieval*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 1728–1738, 2021.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
