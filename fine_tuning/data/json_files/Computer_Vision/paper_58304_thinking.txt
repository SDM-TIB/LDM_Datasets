To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Image Restoration with Mean-Reverting Stochastic Differential Equations" by Ziwei Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two deraining datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors evaluate their method on various tasks. In **subsection 4.1 (Image Deraining)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Rain100H**: This dataset contains 1,800 pairs of images with and without rain for training and 100 pairs for testing. The authors note that they report PSNR and SSIM scores on this dataset.

2. **Rain100L**: This dataset has 200 pairs for training and 100 pairs for testing. Similar to Rain100H, the authors report performance metrics on this dataset as well.

In **subsection 4.2 (Image Deblurring)**, the authors mention the **GoPro dataset**, which contains 2,103 image pairs for training and 1,111 image pairs for testing. This dataset is used to evaluate the deblurring performance of their method.

In **subsection 4.3 (Image Denoising)**, the authors state that they collected high-quality images from several datasets, including **DIV2K**, **Flickr2K**, **BSD500**, and **Waterloo Exploration** datasets for training. They also mention testing on the **McMaster**, **Kodak24**, and **CBSD68** datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

With all this information gathered, I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
