To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improved ArtGAN for Conditional Synthesis of Natural Image and Artwork" by Wei Ren Tan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their model on several datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets used in their experiments. I will look for explicit mentions of dataset names and any relevant details.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** (Section V), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, I will look for any specific datasets mentioned, including their characteristics, such as the number of samples, resolution, and any unique features that might be relevant for understanding their use in the study.

In this paper, the authors mention several datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. This dataset is widely used for training machine learning models in image classification tasks.

2. **STL-10**: This dataset is inspired by CIFAR-10 but contains higher resolution images (96x96 pixels) and fewer labeled training examples, making it a more challenging dataset for supervised learning.

3. **Oxford-102**: A dataset containing images of 102 flower categories, with each category having a varying number of samples. This dataset is used for fine-grained classification tasks.

4. **CUB-200**: The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset includes images of 200 bird species, providing a rich resource for studying fine-grained image classification.

5. **WikiArt**: A large dataset of fine-art paintings, which includes around 80,000 annotated paintings for various classification tasks based on genres, artists, and styles.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **STL-10**:
  > Marco Nilsback and Andrew Zisserman. *Automated Flower Classification over a Large Number of Classes*. In Proceedings of the Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics and Image Processing, 2008.

- For **Oxford-102**:
  > M.-E. Nilsback and A. Zisserman. *Automated Flower Classification over a Large Number of Classes*. In Proceedings of the Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics and Image Processing, 2008.

- For **CUB-200**:
  > C. Wah, S. Branson, P. Welinder, P. Perona, and S. Belongie. *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*. California Institute of Technology, Tech. Rep. CNS-TR-2011-001, 2011.

- For **WikiArt**:
  > Saleh, B., & Elgammal, A. *Large-scale Classification of Fine-Art Paintings: Learning the Right Metric on the Right Feature*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1505.00855, 2015.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
