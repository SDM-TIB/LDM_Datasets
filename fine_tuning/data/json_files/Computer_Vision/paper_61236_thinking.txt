To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can Large Language Models Capture Dissenting Human Voices?" by Noah Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental design sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating LLMs on "two different techniques" and implies the use of datasets, which is a good starting point.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of datasets that capture multiple interpretations and dissenting opinions. They reference recent datasets that have been developed for this purpose, which suggests that specific datasets will be mentioned later.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental design section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention several datasets:

1. **ChaosNLI**: This dataset is referenced multiple times throughout the paper, indicating its significance in evaluating LLMs against human disagreement. The authors note that it consists of multiple task settings, including ChaosNLI-α, ChaosNLI-S, and ChaosNLI-M.

2. **PK2019**: This dataset is also mentioned as part of the evaluation process, specifically in relation to human opinion distribution.

3. **ANLI (Adversarial NLI)**: The authors specify that they use the round 3 version of this dataset, which contains diverse contexts.

4. **QNLI**: This dataset is derived from the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) and is used to assess the models' inference capabilities.

5. **DisagreementNLI**: This dataset is used to analyze the sources of disagreement in LLM outputs.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **ChaosNLI**, the citation is:
  > Yixin Nie, Xiang Zhou, and Mohit Bansal. *What can we learn from collective human opinions on natural language inference data?* In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 9131–9143, Online, 2020.

- For **PK2019**, the citation is:

- For **ANLI**, the citation is:

- For **QNLI**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text.* In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2383–2392, 2016.

- For **DisagreementNLI**, the citation is:
  > Nan-Jiang Jiang and Marie-Catherine de Marneffe. *Investigating reasons for disagreement in natural language inference.* Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 10:1357–1374, 2022.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for further processing or review.
