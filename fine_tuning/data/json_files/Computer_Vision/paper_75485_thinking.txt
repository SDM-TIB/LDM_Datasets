To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LiteFocus: Accelerated Diffusion Inference for Long Audio Synthesis" by Zhenxiong Tan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of latent diffusion models for audio generation but does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss advancements in text-to-audio synthesis and mention various applications, but again, no specific datasets are cited. I will continue to the **methods section** where they describe the audio latent diffusion model and its components, but still, no datasets are explicitly mentioned.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors state that they utilized the **AudioCap Evaluation Set** to generate audio clips from captions. This is a significant finding as it indicates a dataset used for their experiments.

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **AudioCap Evaluation Set**. The relevant citation is:

- For **AudioCap Evaluation Set**:
  > C. D. Kim, B. Kim, H. Lee, and G. Kim. "Audiocaps: Generating captions for audios in the wild." In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), 2019, pp. 119â€“132.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize my findings. The only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper is the **AudioCap Evaluation Set**, which is used for evaluating the audio generation quality.

Now, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
