To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Language-Guided Diffusion Model for Visual Grounding" by Sijia Chen and Baochun Li, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to "extensive experiments for our proposed framework on five widely used datasets," indicating that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention specific datasets used for evaluation. They highlight the **Flickr30K Entities**, **ReferItGame**, **RefCOCO**, **RefCOCO+**, and **RefCOCOg** datasets. This gives me a clear list of datasets to investigate further.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors provide more details about the datasets. They describe the **Flickr30K Entities** dataset as a phrase localization dataset that includes 31,783 images and 427K referred entities. They also mention that the **ReferItGame** dataset contains 130,525 referring expressions for 96,654 objects within 19,894 natural scene images. The **RefCOCO**, **RefCOCO+**, and **RefCOCOg** datasets are described as referring expression datasets based on images from the COCO dataset, with specific numbers of images and expressions provided.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
