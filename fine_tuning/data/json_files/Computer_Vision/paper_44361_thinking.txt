To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3D Human Shape and Pose from a Single Low-Resolution Image with Self-Supervised Learning" by Xiangyu Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of 3D human shape and pose estimation from low-resolution images, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using both 3D and 2D datasets. Specifically, they state that they use the **Human3.6M** and **MPI-INF-3DHP** datasets for 3D keypoints, and several 2D datasets including **LSP**, **LSP-Extended**, **MPII**, and **MS COCO**.

I will then gather detailed descriptions of these datasets:

1. **Human3.6M**: A large-scale dataset for 3D human pose estimation that includes 3D keypoints and SMPL parameters. It is widely used in the field for training and evaluating models.

2. **MPI-INF-3DHP**: Another dataset that provides ground truth for 3D keypoints and is used for benchmarking 3D human pose estimation methods.

3. **LSP (Leeds Sports Pose)**: A dataset containing images of sports activities with annotated 2D keypoints, commonly used for training pose estimation models.

4. **LSP-Extended**: An extension of the LSP dataset that includes additional images and annotations for improved training.

5. **MPII (MPI Human Pose Dataset)**: A dataset that provides images with annotated 2D keypoints for human pose estimation, widely used in the community.

6. **MS COCO (Microsoft Common Objects in Context)**: A large-scale dataset that includes images with various objects and annotations, including human keypoints.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- **Human3.6M**:

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete for future reference.
