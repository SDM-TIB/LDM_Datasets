To extract datasets from the research paper titled "InstantID: Zero-shot Identity-Preserving Generation in Seconds" by Qixun Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a large-scale open-source dataset, which indicates that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention training on the **LAION-Face dataset**, which consists of 50 million image-text pairs. This is a significant dataset for their work, and I will need to note its details.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **related work** or **methods sections**. However, the primary dataset of interest appears to be the LAION-Face dataset, as it is specifically highlighted in the context of their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the LAION-Face dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Zheng, Y., Yang, H., Zhang, T., Bao, J., Chen, D., Huang, Y., Yuan, L., Chen, D., Zeng, M., Wen, F. "General facial representation learning in a visual-linguistic manner." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 18697â€“18709, 2022.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the LAION-Face dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read through the abstract, introduction, and methods sections to identify datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for explicit mentions of datasets.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references section for any identified datasets.

This structured approach ensures that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
