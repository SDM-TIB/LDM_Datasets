To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Latent Diffusion for Language Generation" by Justin Lovelace et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets section** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their approach across multiple diverse datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets they evaluated their method on. This section is crucial as it typically contains detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their names, purposes, and any relevant statistics.

In this paper, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **ROCStories**: A corpus of 98,161 five-sentence commonsense stories. This dataset is used to evaluate the model's performance in generating coherent narratives.

2. **AG News Topic Classification**: This dataset consists of news articles across four topics (World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech) with 120,000 training instances. The authors focus on generating article descriptions.

3. **XSum**: A dataset consisting of BBC articles from 2010 to 2017, with 204,045 training instances. Each example contains a document and a summary, making it suitable for summarization tasks.

4. **QQP (Quora Question Pairs)**: This dataset includes 400,000 question pairs, where each example consists of two similar questions and a binary label indicating whether they have the same meaning.

5. **WMT 2014 English-German**: A widely used machine translation dataset consisting of approximately 4.5 million sentence pairs.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
