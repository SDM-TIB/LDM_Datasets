To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Learning a Vocabulary of Visual Concepts and Operators using Deep Neural Networks" by Sunil Kumar Vengalil and Neelam Sinha, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using the **MNIST dataset**, which is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition. This is a strong indication that I should focus on this dataset.

Next, I will look into **section II (Related Work)** and **section III (Proposed Method)**, where the authors discuss their experiments in detail. In section III, specifically under **subsection B (Dataset)**, they mention that they conducted experiments on the **MNIST dataset** and augmented it by adding 3000 training images for each of the 18 visual concepts they generated. This confirms that the MNIST dataset is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

The authors also describe the process of augmenting the MNIST dataset with additional images generated from visual concepts. They state that the final training set consists of the original 60,000 MNIST images plus 54,000 generated images, leading to a total of 114,000 images. This is important information for understanding the dataset's composition.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is commonly cited, and I can use the following citation:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 2010. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The original dataset contains 60,000 training images of handwritten digits (0-9). The authors augmented this dataset by generating an additional 54,000 images based on 18 visual concepts, resulting in a total of 114,000 images for training.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset details along with the full citation, ensuring that all necessary information is included for future reference or analysis.
