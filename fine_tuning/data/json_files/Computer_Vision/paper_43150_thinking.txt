To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Relational Modeling for Robust and Efficient Pulmonary Lobe Segmentation in CT Scans" by Weiyi Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of CT scans for pulmonary lobe segmentation and indicates that the authors utilized data from the COPDGene study and a dataset from Radboud University Medical Center for their experiments. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into the **Methods** section, specifically the **Data** subsection, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they mention two primary datasets:

1. **COPDGene Study Dataset**: This dataset consists of CT scans from a cohort of 5000 subjects with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), with 4000 scans used for training and 1000 for evaluation. The authors note that the data is publicly available after submitting an ancillary study proposal.

2. **COVID-19 Dataset**: This dataset includes CT scans from 470 subjects suspected of having COVID-19, with 370 scans used for retraining and 100 for evaluation. The authors specify that these scans were obtained from Radboud University Medical Center and that permission for research use was obtained.

I will then check the **References** section to find the full citations for these datasets. The COPDGene study is referenced as follows:

- **COPDGene Study**: 
  > Regan, E. A., Hokanson, J. E., Murphy, J. R., Make, B., Lynch, D. A., Beaty, T. H., Curran-Everett, D., Silverman, E. K., & Crapo, J. D. (2011). Genetic epidemiology of COPD (COPDGene) study design. *COPD*, 7(1), 32-43.

For the COVID-19 dataset, while the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, it mentions that the scans were collected under local guidelines and with ethical approval. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is from Radboud University Medical Center, but a formal citation may not be available.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **COPDGene Study Dataset**: A dataset of CT scans from 5000 subjects with COPD, publicly available after proposal submission.
   - Citation: Regan, E. A., et al. (2011). Genetic epidemiology of COPD (COPDGene) study design. *COPD*, 7(1), 32-43.

2. **COVID-19 Dataset**: CT scans from 470 subjects suspected of having COVID-19, collected under ethical guidelines from Radboud University Medical Center.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
