To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Portrait Stylization: Artistic Style Transfer with Auxiliary Networks for Human Face Stylization" by Thiago Ambiel, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the use of embeddings from a pre-trained face recognition model, which suggests that there may be datasets related to face recognition or style transfer. I need to identify any specific datasets mentioned.

Next, I will examine the **background and proposed method sections**. Here, the author discusses the use of the FaceNet model, which is pre-trained on the VGGFace2 dataset. This indicates that VGGFace2 is a dataset used in the research, and I need to note its details.

In the **references section**, I will look for the full citation of the VGGFace2 dataset. The citation is:
> Cao, Q., Shen, L., Xie, W., Parkhi, O. M., and Zisserman, A. (2017). VGGFace2: A dataset for recognising faces across pose and age. CoRR, abs/1710.08092.

Additionally, I will check if there are any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, particularly in sections discussing experiments or results. The paper does not explicitly mention any other datasets, but it does reference the use of the FaceNet model, which is based on the VGGFace2 dataset.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the VGGFace2 dataset. 

In summary, the key dataset extracted from this paper is:
1. **VGGFace2 Dataset**: Used for face recognition and feature extraction in the proposed method.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Cao, Q., Shen, L., Xie, W., Parkhi, O. M., and Zisserman, A. (2017). VGGFace2: A dataset for recognising faces across pose and age. CoRR, abs/1710.08092.

With this information, I am ready to create the dataset entry in the required format for further processing.
