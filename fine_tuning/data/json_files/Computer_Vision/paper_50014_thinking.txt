To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Contrastive Learning of Subject-Invariant EEG Representations for Cross-Subject Emotion Recognition" by Xinke Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to their method achieving state-of-the-art performance on the **THU-EP dataset** and the **SEED dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In **section 4.1**, they describe the **THU-EP dataset** in detail, mentioning that it consists of data from 80 subjects and includes emotional video clips designed to elicit various emotions. They also provide specifics about the subjects and the experimental setup.

In **section 4.2**, the authors briefly describe the **SEED dataset**, noting that it contains EEG data from 15 subjects who watched film clips designed to elicit different emotions. This section confirms that both datasets are used for evaluating their proposed method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **THU-EP dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hu, X., Wang, F., & Zhang, D. (2021). Similar Brains Blend Emotion in Similar Ways: Neural Representations of Individual Difference in Emotion Profiles. *NeuroImage*, 147, 118819. doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.118819.

- For the **SEED dataset**, the citation is:
  > Duan, R.-N., Zhu, J.-Y., & Lu, B.-L. (2013). Differential Entropy Feature for EEG-Based Emotion Classification. In *Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)*, pp. 81-84.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **THU-EP Dataset**: A dataset consisting of EEG data from 80 subjects, designed to study cross-subject emotion recognition through emotional video clips.
2. **SEED Dataset**: A widely-used dataset containing EEG data from 15 subjects who watched film clips to elicit various emotions.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
