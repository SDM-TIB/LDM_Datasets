To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Compositional Text-to-Image Generation with Large Vision-Language Models" by Song Wen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of large vision-language models (LVLMs) and discusses the evaluation of their method, which may imply the use of specific datasets for training or evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly the parts that detail the experimental setup. In section 4.1 (Implementation Detail), the authors mention sourcing text-image pairs from **LAION-5B** and extracting input text from **DiffusionDB** for training data. This indicates that these two datasets are integral to their experiments.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citation for **LAION-5B** is:
> LAION. LAION-5B: A Large-Scale Dataset for Image-Text Pairs. Available at: https://laion.ai/laion-5b.

For **DiffusionDB**, the citation is:
> DiffusionDB. DiffusionDB: A Dataset for Text-to-Image Generation. Available at: https://diffusiondb.com.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **LAION-5B**: A large-scale dataset containing image-text pairs used for training text-to-image models.
2. **DiffusionDB**: A dataset specifically designed for text-to-image generation tasks, providing a variety of input texts.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
