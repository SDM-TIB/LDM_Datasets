To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Survival Cluster Analysis" by Paidamoyo Chapfuwa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for a table or a list that summarizes the datasets, including their characteristics such as the number of observations, types of covariates, and any relevant statistics.

In the paper, I find a **Table 1** that summarizes six datasets used in the experiments. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **ehr**: A large study from the Duke University Health System centered around multiple inpatient visits due to comorbidities in patients with Type-2 diabetes.
2. **flchain**: A study of non-clonal serum immunoglobulin free light chains effects on survival time.
3. **support**: Investigates the survival time of seriously-ill hospitalized adults.
4. **seer**: Accessible from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, focusing on breast cancer.
5. **sleep**: A subset of the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS), focusing on cardiovascular consequences of sleep-disordered breathing.
6. **framingham**: A subset of the Framingham Offspring study, initially for predicting coronary heart disease risk.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation for future reference.
