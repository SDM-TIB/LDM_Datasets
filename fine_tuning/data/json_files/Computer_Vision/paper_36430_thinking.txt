To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Estimation of Interventional Effects of Features on Prediction" by Patrick BlÃ¶baum and Shohei Shimizu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on causal relationships and prediction mechanisms, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of understanding prediction mechanisms but does not specify any datasets used in the study.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will look for any mention of datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors describe their evaluation using both **artificial data** and **real-world data**. They mention generating random Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for artificial data and refer to the **Auto-MPG dataset** from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) database as the real-world dataset used for demonstration.

The **Auto-MPG dataset** is described as containing records of MPG consumption for 398 automobiles, with features such as the number of cylinders, weight, displacement, horsepower, acceleration, and MPG consumption. This dataset is crucial for understanding the application of their proposed framework.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Auto-MPG dataset. The citation for this dataset is typically attributed to the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which is a well-known source for various datasets.

The citation for the Auto-MPG dataset is:
> Frank, A. & Asuncion, A. (2010). *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. University of California, Irvine, School of Information and Computer Sciences. Available at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg

Since the paper does not mention any other specific datasets, I will compile the information regarding the Auto-MPG dataset for inclusion in the final output.

In summary, I have identified the following dataset from the paper:

1. **Auto-MPG Dataset**: A dataset containing MPG consumption data for 398 automobiles, with features such as the number of cylinders, weight, displacement, horsepower, acceleration, and MPG consumption.

Now, I will prepare to format this information according to the specified requirements for downstream processing.
