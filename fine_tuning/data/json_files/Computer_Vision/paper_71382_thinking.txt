To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convolutional Prompting meets Language Models for Continual Learning" by Anurag Roy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments across several rehearsal-free continual learning benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. They mention three datasets:

1. **ImageNet-R**: This dataset is formed from 200 subcategories of ImageNet but includes images from different domains such as cartoon, graffiti, and origami. It contains 24,000 training images and 6,000 test images. The authors state that they split the 200 classes into 10 tasks, with each task containing 20 classes.

2. **CIFAR-100**: A widely used dataset in continual learning, it contains 100 classes, each with 500 training and 100 test images. The authors follow a 10-task setup, with each task containing 10 classes.

3. **CUB-200**: This is a fine-grained dataset containing 200 classes of different bird species, with 5,994 training images and 5,794 test images. The authors also use a 10-task setup for this dataset, with each task containing 20 classes.

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *Imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge*. International journal of computer vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Citeseer, 2009.

- For **CUB-200**, the citation is:
  > C. Wah, S. Branson, P. Welinder, P. Perona, and S. Belongie. *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset*. California Institute of Technology, 2011.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a clear and organized presentation of the datasets used in the research.
