To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatial-Temporal Interactive Dynamic Graph Convolution Network for Traffic Forecasting" by Aoyu Liu and Yaying Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that "extensive experiments on four real-world traffic flow datasets demonstrate that STIDGCN outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines." This indicates that datasets are indeed used, and I need to find their names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets: **PEMS03, PEMS04, PEMS07, and PEMS08**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including the number of nodes, edges, time steps, time range, and missing rate.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the source of these datasets as being collected by the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Therefore, I will document the citation for the PeMS datasets as follows:

- For **PEMS03**, the citation is:
  > Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). "PEMS03 Dataset." Available at: [PeMS website link].

- For **PEMS04**, the citation is:
  > Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). "PEMS04 Dataset." Available at: [PeMS website link].

- For **PEMS07**, the citation is:
  > Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). "PEMS07 Dataset." Available at: [PeMS website link].

- For **PEMS08**, the citation is:
  > Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). "PEMS08 Dataset." Available at: [PeMS website link].

Since the datasets are publicly available and sourced from the same system, I will ensure to mention that they are part of the same collection in my documentation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately and is ready for use.
