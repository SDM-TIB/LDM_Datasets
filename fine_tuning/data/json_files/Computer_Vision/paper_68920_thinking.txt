To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SciMMIR: Benchmarking Scientific Multi-modal Information Retrieval" by Siwei Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the SciMMIR benchmark comprises **530K meticulously curated image-text pairs**, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors describe the dataset in detail in **section 3 (Dataset Collection)**. Here, they specify that the SciMMIR dataset consists of **530K scientific image-text pairs** collected from figures and tables in scholarly documents on arXiv.

I will note the following details about the dataset:

1. **SciMMIR Dataset**: This dataset includes 530,000 image-text pairs with annotations for various subcategories. It is designed to evaluate multi-modal information retrieval in the scientific domain.

In the **References section**, I will look for any citations related to the dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the SciMMIR dataset itself, as it is a new benchmark created by the authors. Instead, I will note that the dataset is publicly available and can be accessed via the provided GitHub link.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and any relevant citations or links.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the SciMMIR dataset, ready for further processing or review.
