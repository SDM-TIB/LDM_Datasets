To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Nonlinear Diffusion Method for Semi-Supervised Learning on Hypergraphs" by Konstantin Prokopchik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, which can help identify them.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, there is a **Table 1** that lists several real-world hypergraph datasets used in the experiments. This table includes key details such as the number of nodes, hyperedges, features, and labels for each dataset.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **DBLP Co-authorship**: 
   - Number of nodes: 43,413
   - Number of hyperedges: 22,535
   - Number of features: 1,425
   - Number of labels: 6

2. **Pubmed Co-citation**: 
   - Number of nodes: 19,717
   - Number of hyperedges: 7,963
   - Number of features: 500
   - Number of labels: 3

3. **Cora Co-authorship**: 
   - Number of nodes: 2,708
   - Number of hyperedges: 1,072
   - Number of features: 1,433
   - Number of labels: 7

4. **Cora Co-citation**: 
   - Number of nodes: 2,708
   - Number of hyperedges: 1,579
   - Number of features: 1,433
   - Number of labels: 7

5. **Citeseer Co-citation**: 
   - Number of nodes: 3,312
   - Number of hyperedges: 1,079
   - Number of features: 3,703
   - Number of labels: 6

6. **Foodweb Carbon-exchange**: 
   - Number of nodes: 122
   - Number of hyperedges: 141,233
   - Number of features: 0
   - Number of labels: 3

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to each dataset. The paper may not provide explicit citations for all datasets, but I can look for the original sources or related works cited in the references.

For example, the **DBLP** dataset is commonly referenced in the literature, and I can cite it as follows:
- DBLP dataset citation: 
  > Ryan Rossi and Nesreen Ahmed. *The network data repository with interactive graph analytics and visualization*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, volume 29, 2015.

For the **Pubmed** dataset, I can use:
- Pubmed dataset citation:
  > Prithviraj Sen, Galileo Namata, Mustafa Bilgic, Lise Getoor, Brian Galligher, and Tina Eliassi-Rad. *Collective classification in network data*. AI magazine, 29(3):93â€“93, 2008.

I will continue this process for the remaining datasets, ensuring that I provide full citations for each.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
