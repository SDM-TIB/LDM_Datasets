To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Extracting Domain Invariant Features by Unsupervised Learning for Robust Automatic Speech Recognition" by Wei-Ning Hsu and James Glass, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to experiments conducted on **Aurora-4** and **CHiME-4**, indicating that these are the datasets used for their evaluations.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Experiment Setup)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **Aurora-4**: This dataset is described as a broadband corpus designed for noisy speech recognition tasks based on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ0) corpus. It includes various conditions such as clean, channel, and noisy speech, which are essential for their experiments.

2. **CHiME-4**: This dataset consists of real distant-talking recordings in noisy environments. The authors specify that they used the original clean utterances and the single-channel real noisy utterances for training their models.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations I find are:

- For **Aurora-4**, the citation is:
  > David Pearce. *Aurora working group: DSR front end LVCSR evaluation AU/384/02*. Ph.D. thesis, Mississippi State University, 2002.

- For **CHiME-4**, the citation is:
  > Emmanuel Vincent, Shinji Watanabe, Aditya Arie Nugraha, Jon Barker, and Ricard Marxer. *An analysis of environment, microphone and data simulation mismatches in robust speech recognition*. Computer Speech & Language, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
