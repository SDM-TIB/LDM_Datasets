To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pattern formation in dense populations studied by inference of nonlinear diffusion-reaction mechanisms" by Siddhartha Srivastava and Krishna Garikipati, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or simulations. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. This section often includes information about the datasets used, such as their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. 

In this paper, I will look for specific mentions of datasets related to the experiments conducted, particularly in sections discussing the **variational system inference** and **data-driven inference of governing equations**. These sections may detail the datasets used for training the models or for validating the results.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset from a previous study, I will locate that study in the references and extract the full citation. If the datasets are original or newly created for this research, I will note that as well.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset descriptions, including their names, characteristics, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate.
