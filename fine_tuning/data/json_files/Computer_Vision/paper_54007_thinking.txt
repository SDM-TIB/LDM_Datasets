To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accelerating Score-based Generative Models for High-Resolution Image Synthesis" by Hengyuan Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that extensive experiments were conducted on **CIFAR-10, CelebA, LSUN, and FFHQ datasets**. This indicates that these datasets are likely important for the research.

Next, I will check the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about these datasets. The introduction confirms that the authors used these datasets for evaluating their proposed method, which reinforces their significance.

Then, I will look at the **experiments section** (section 5) to gather more specific information about how each dataset was used. In this section, the authors describe the datasets in detail:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CelebA**: A large-scale face attributes dataset with over 200,000 celebrity images, each annotated with 40 attribute labels.
3. **LSUN**: A dataset containing images from various categories, specifically mentioning the **bedroom** and **church** categories, which are used for training and evaluation.
4. **FFHQ**: The Flickr-Faces-HQ dataset, which contains 70,000 high-quality images of human faces at a resolution of 1024x1024.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), December 2015.

- For **LSUN**, the citation is:
  > Fisher Yu, Ari Seff, Yinda Zhang, Shuran Song, Thomas Funkhouser, and Jianxiong Xiao. *LSUN: Construction of a large-scale image dataset using deep learning with humans in the loop*. arXiv preprint, 2015.

- For **FFHQ**, the citation is:
  > Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. *A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks*. In CVPR, 2019.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
