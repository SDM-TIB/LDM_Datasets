To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretable Companions for Black-Box Models" by Danqing Pan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 6**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they provide a table (Table 1) that lists several datasets along with their characteristics, such as the number of instances, features, and categories. This table is crucial as it summarizes the datasets in a clear format.

The datasets mentioned in the paper include:

1. **Messidor Dataset**: A medical dataset with 1,151 instances and 19 features.
2. **German Credit Dataset**: A finance dataset with 1,000 instances and 20 features.
3. **Adult Dataset**: A finance dataset with 48,842 instances and 14 features.
4. **Juvenile Dataset**: A justice dataset with 4,023 instances and 55 features.
5. **Frisk Dataset**: A justice dataset with 80,755 instances and 26 features.
6. **Recidivism Dataset**: A justice dataset with 11,645 instances and 106 features.
7. **Magic Dataset**: A physics dataset with 19,020 instances and 10 features.
8. **Coupon Dataset**: A commerce dataset with 3,996 instances and 95 features.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper cites the sources of the datasets, which is essential for proper attribution. 

For example, the citation for the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**, which hosts many of these datasets, is:
> Dheeru Dua and Casey Graff. *UCI Machine Learning Repository*, 2017.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
