The activity sensory data is collected from 3 Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) attached to three different positions, namely the dominant wrist, the chest and the dominant sides ankle. Each IMU contains two 3-axis accelerometers, one 3-axis gyroscope, one 3-axis magnetometer and one thermometer with the sampling rate of 100 Hz.",
