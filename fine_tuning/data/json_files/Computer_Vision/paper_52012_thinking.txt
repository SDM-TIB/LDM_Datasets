To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structured Time Series Prediction without Structural Prior" by Darko Drakulic and Jean-Marc Andreoli, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **three public traffic datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental setting)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **PEMS-BAY**: This dataset consists of 207 locations and provides data as speed averages or sums of traffic flow on contiguous 5-minute intervals. The data range is from 1/1/2017 to 5/3/2017.

2. **METR-LA**: This dataset has 325 locations and also provides speed averages or sums of traffic flow on 5-minute intervals. The data range is from 3/1/2012 to 1/30/2012.

3. **PEMS07**: This dataset contains 883 locations and provides similar data as the previous datasets. The data range is from 5/1/2017 to 8/31/2017.

In the same section, the authors describe how instances in each dataset are obtained by splitting the data into 2-hour moving windows with a one-hour overlap, which provides additional context about how the datasets are structured.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are commonly used public datasets in the field of traffic prediction. Therefore, I will provide the commonly accepted references for these datasets based on existing literature:

- For **PEMS-BAY**, the citation is:
  > Yaguang Li et al. "Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network: Data-Driven Traffic Forecasting". In: arXiv:1707.01926 [cs, stat] (July 2017).

- For **METR-LA**, the citation is:
  > Yaguang Li et al. "Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network: Data-Driven Traffic Forecasting". In: arXiv:1707.01926 [cs, stat] (July 2017).

- For **PEMS07**, the citation is:
  > Yaguang Li et al. "Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network: Data-Driven Traffic Forecasting". In: arXiv:1707.01926 [cs, stat] (July 2017).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their respective citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
