To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine learning emulation of precipitation from km-scale regional climate simulations using a diffusion model" by Henry Addison et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a machine learning emulator for precipitation simulations but does not explicitly name any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the challenges of simulating precipitation and the need for high-resolution models. They mention using output from the Met Office UK convection-permitting model but do not provide specific dataset names.

I will then look into **section 4 (Materials and Methods)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Data)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. They mention using data from the UKCP Local product and the UKCP18 Global simulations. 

The specific datasets identified are:
1. **UKCP Local product**: This dataset is used for training the emulator and contains high-resolution precipitation data.
2. **UKCP18 Global simulations**: This dataset provides boundary conditions for the CPM.

In the **References section**, I will find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **UKCP Local product**:
  > Kendon, E. J., N. M. Roberts, C. A. Senior, and M. J. Roberts. "Realism of Rainfall in a Very High-Resolution Regional Climate Model." *Journal of Climate* 25.17 (2012): 5791â€“5806. doi: 10.1175/Jcli-D-11-00562.1.

- For the **UKCP18 Global simulations**:
  > Murphy, J., G. Harris, D. Sexton, E. Kendon, P. Bett, R. Clark, K. Eagle, G. Fosser, F. Fung, and J. Lowe. "UKCP18 land projections: science report." (2018).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their full citations, which is crucial for proper attribution and future reference.
