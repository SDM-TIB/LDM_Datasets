To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EASI-Tex: Edge-Aware Mesh Texturing from Single Image" by Sai Raj Kishore Perla et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **results section (4.1)**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they perform experiments on diverse 3D objects primarily chosen from the **Objaverse** dataset, along with other sources. This indicates that Objaverse is a key dataset for their research.

Next, I will look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors also reference other sources for 3D models, including:

1. **DeCarlo et al. 2003**: This refers to a dataset or models used in their experiments.
2. **Praun et al. 2000**: Another source for 3D models mentioned in the context of their evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Objaverse**, the citation is:
  > Matt Deitke, Ruoshi Liu, Matthew Wallingford, Huong Ngo, Oscar Michel, Aditya Kusupati, Alan Fan, Christian Laforte, Vikram Voleti, Samir Yitzhak Gadre, Eli VanderBilt, Aniruddha Kembhavi, Carl Vondrick, Georgia Gkioxari, Kiana Ehsani, Ludwig Schmidt, and Ali Farhadi. *Objaverse: A Universe of Annotated 3D Objects*. In IEEE Conf. Comput. Vis. Pattern Recog. 13142–13153, 2023.

- For **DeCarlo et al. 2003**, the citation is:
  > Douglas DeCarlo, Adam Finkelstein, Szymon Rusinkiewicz, and Anthony Stella. *Suggestive contours for conveying shape*. ACM Trans. Graph. 22, 3 (2003), 848–855. https://doi.org/10.1145/882262.882354

- For **Praun et al. 2000**, the citation is:
  > Emil Praun, Adam Finkelstein, and Hugues Hoppe. *Lapped textures*. In Proceedings of the 27th Annual Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques, SIGGRAPH. ACM, 465–470. https://doi.org/10.1145/344779.344987

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further studies in the field.
