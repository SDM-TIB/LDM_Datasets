To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Deep Reinforcement Learning and Unfolding: Beam Selection and Precoding for mmWave Multiuser MIMO with Lens Arrays" by Qiyu Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets used, such as **"Experiments," "Results," or "Datasets."** In this paper, the authors discuss their methodology and the simulations they conducted, which may involve datasets for training or testing their models.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention a dataset developed for investigating beam selection techniques in vehicle-to-infrastructure scenarios. This indicates that there is at least one dataset relevant to their research.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for this dataset. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the dataset.

The relevant dataset mentioned in the paper is:

1. **Beam Selection Dataset**: This dataset is used for investigating beam selection techniques in vehicle-to-infrastructure scenarios. Unfortunately, the paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset, which is a common practice in research papers. However, I will note that it is essential to provide a citation if available.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation for any datasets referenced in the paper. If the dataset is not cited, I will note that it is an internal dataset developed by the authors.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
