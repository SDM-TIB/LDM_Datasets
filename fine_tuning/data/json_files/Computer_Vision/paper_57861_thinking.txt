To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mediastinal Lymph Node Detection and Segmentation Using Deep Learning" by Al-Akhir Nayan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected CT image data from TCIA, 5-patients, and ELCAP public datasets, which suggests that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Related Works)** and **section III (Research Method)**, particularly the subsection titled **A. DATASET**. Here, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for training and testing their model. They state that they utilized the TCIA dataset, the 5-patients dataset, and the ELCAP public dataset, and they describe how these datasets were combined for testing purposes.

In **section III.A**, the authors provide details about the datasets:
1. **TCIA (The Cancer Imaging Archive)**: This dataset is a large-scale collection of CT and PET/CT images used for lung cancer diagnosis.
2. **5-patients dataset**: This dataset consists of images from five patients, specifically curated for this study.
3. **ELCAP (Early Lung Cancer Action Project)**: This public dataset is also utilized for lung cancer research.

I will now check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are as follows:

- For **TCIA**, the citation is:

After compiling this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and ease of use in future references or analyses. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
