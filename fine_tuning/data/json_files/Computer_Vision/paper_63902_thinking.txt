To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ensemble of Anchor-Free Models for Robust Bangla Document Layout Segmentation" by Sain Chak et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset for the DL Sprint 2.0 - BUET CSE Fest 2023 Competition focused on Bangla document layout segmentation. This indicates that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly the parts discussing the dataset. In the introduction, the authors highlight the lack of publicly available datasets for Bangla document layout analysis, which reinforces the importance of the competition dataset they are utilizing.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors refer to the "DL Sprint 2.0 - BUET CSE Fest 2023 Competition" as a source of the dataset, but I need to confirm if they provide a specific name or details about the dataset.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The references include a citation for the competition, which is crucial for providing the full citation of the dataset used.

The relevant dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **DL Sprint 2.0 - BUET CSE Fest 2023 Competition Dataset**: This dataset is specifically designed for Bangla document layout segmentation and is used in the authors' experiments. The competition provides a challenging dataset of Bangla documents, which is essential for developing and evaluating layout segmentation systems.

Now, I will retrieve the full citation for this dataset from the references section:

- For the **DL Sprint 2.0 - BUET CSE Fest 2023 Competition Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Haider, Md. Asif, Salman Khondker, Sameen53, Sushmit, and Tahsin. *DL Sprint 2.0 - BUET CSE Fest 2023.* Kaggle, 2023. URL: https://kaggle.com/competitions/dlsprint2.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
