To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sampling possible reconstructions of undersampled acquisitions in MR imaging with a deep learned prior" by Kerem C. Tezcan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on two datasets: the **Human Connectome Project** and **in-house measured multi-coil images**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the study.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **methods section**. The authors describe the **Human Connectome Project (HCP)** as a source of T1 weighted slices from 780 subjects, with a total of 202,800 slices of size 252x308. They also mention that the in-house measured images are T1 weighted brain images acquired with 13 coils, which have similar acquisition parameters to the HCP images.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation. The authors state that they used the HCP dataset for training the variational autoencoder and the in-house dataset for testing, which reinforces the importance of these datasets in their research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **references section**. The citation for the **Human Connectome Project** is:
> David C. Van Essen et al. "The Human Connectome Project: A data acquisition perspective." *NeuroImage*, vol. 62, no. 4, pp. 2222-2231, 2012.

For the **in-house measured images**, since they are not a publicly available dataset, I will note that they are described as T1 weighted brain images acquired with specific parameters, but they do not have a formal citation like the HCP.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the names, descriptions, and citations, into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **Human Connectome Project**: T1 weighted slices from 780 subjects, 202,800 slices of size 252x308.
   - Citation: David C. Van Essen et al. "The Human Connectome Project: A data acquisition perspective." *NeuroImage*, vol. 62, no. 4, pp. 2222-2231, 2012.
   
2. **In-house measured multi-coil images**: T1 weighted brain images acquired with 13 coils, specific acquisition parameters.

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately identified and documented the datasets used in the research paper.
