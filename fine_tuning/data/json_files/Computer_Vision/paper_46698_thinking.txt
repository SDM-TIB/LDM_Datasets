To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Disentangled Recurrent Wasserstein Autoencoder" by Jun Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that experiments were conducted on a variety of datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the datasets are described in **Appendix C**. Here, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Stochastic Moving MNIST (SM-MNIST)**: This dataset consists of sequences of frames containing one MNIST digit moving and bouncing off the edges of the frame. The authors note that the digits move with a constant velocity until they hit a wall, at which point they bounce off with a random speed and direction.

   Full citation:
   > No specific citation is provided for the SM-MNIST dataset in the paper, but it is a well-known dataset derived from the original MNIST dataset.

2. **Sprites Dataset**: This dataset consists of animated cartoon characters whose clothing, hairstyle, skin color, and action can be fully controlled. The authors mention using 6 variants in each of 4 attribute categories, resulting in a total of 1296 unique characters.

3. **MUG Facial Dataset**: The MUG Facial Expression Database consists of videos of 86 subjects, each displaying various facial expressions. The authors mention that they cropped the face regions and scaled them to a uniform size for their experiments.

4. **TIMIT Speech Dataset**: This dataset contains phonetically balanced read speech from 630 speakers. The authors describe how they preprocess the raw speech waveforms for their experiments.

After identifying these datasets and their descriptions, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for each dataset, especially for those that are well-known or derived from other works. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
