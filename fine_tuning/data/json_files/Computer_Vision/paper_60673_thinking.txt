To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Unsupervised Discovery of 3D Hierarchical Structure with Generative Diffusion Features" by Nurislam Tursynbek and Marc Niethammer, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on both synthetic datasets and a real-world dataset, which suggests that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **Biologically Inspired Synthetic Datasets**: This dataset consists of 120 volumes with a size of 50 × 50 × 50, designed to represent a three-level structure of biological components. The dataset is split into regular and irregular variants, with the regular variant containing cubical and spherical objects, while the irregular variant includes more complex shapes.

2. **BraTS’19 Dataset**: This is a well-known benchmark for 3D tumor segmentation of brain MRIs. The authors describe how the volumes are co-registered, interpolated, and cropped for their experiments, specifically using FLAIR images and whole tumor annotations for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Biologically Inspired Synthetic Datasets**, the authors reference a previous work that describes this dataset:
  > Hsu, J., Gu, J., Wu, G., Chiu, W., Yeung, S. (2021). *Capturing implicit hierarchical structure in 3D biomedical images with self-supervised hyperbolic representations*. NeurIPS 34, 5112–5123.

- For the **BraTS’19 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Menze, B.H., Jakab, A., Bauer, S., Kalpathy-Cramer, J., Farahani, K., Kirby, J., Burren, Y., Porz, N., Slotboom, J., Wiest, R., et al. (2014). *The multimodal brain tumor image segmentation benchmark (BraTS)*. IEEE TMI 34(10), 1993–2024.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for review or further processing.
