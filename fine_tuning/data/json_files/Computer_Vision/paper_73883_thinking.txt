To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Schr√∂dinger Bridge with Quadratic State Cost is Exactly Solvable" by Alexis M.H. Teter, Wenqing Wang, and Abhishek Halder, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a concise overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit references to datasets or data sources.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. I will look for any specific dataset names, descriptions, and the context in which they were used. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their characteristics, such as size, type, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the complete citation format as used in the paper.

If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will look for any supplementary materials or appendices that might contain additional information about datasets used in the research.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for any required output format, ensuring that all information is clear and well-organized for future reference or analysis.
