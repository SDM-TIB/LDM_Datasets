To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Interpretable Face Recognition" by Bangjie Yin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method on three face recognition benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (Section 4), where the authors describe their experiments in detail. They mention training on **CASIA-WebFace** and **MS-Celeb-1M** datasets, and testing on **IJB-A**, **IJB-C**, and **AR face** datasets. This is a clear indication that these datasets are critical to their research.

I will then summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **CASIA-WebFace**: This dataset contains 493,456 images of 10,575 subjects. It is used for training the CASIA-Net model.
   
2. **MS-Celeb-1M**: This dataset includes 1 million images of 100,000 subjects. The authors mention using a cleaned version of this dataset for training the ResNet50 model.

3. **IJB-A**: This is a benchmark dataset for face recognition that includes 5,000 images and 25,795 subjects. It is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method under various conditions, including synthetic and natural occlusions.

4. **IJB-C**: An extension of IJB-A, this dataset contains 3,134 images and 117,542 video frames of 3,531 subjects. It is used to evaluate occlusion-robust face recognition.

5. **AR face dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately 4,000 images of 126 subjects, specifically focusing on faces with natural occlusions such as glasses and scarves.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **AR face dataset**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
