To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Hyperscanning EEG and VR Omnidirectional Treadmill to Explore Inter-Brain Synchrony in Collaborative Spatial Navigation" by Chun-Hsiang Chuang, Po-Hsun Peng, and Yi-Chieh Chen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the parts that describe the experimental setup and data collection. This section often contains detailed information about the participants, the experimental environment, and the data collected, which may include specific datasets.

In the **participants section**, the authors mention that a group of 70 volunteers participated in the study. This indicates that demographic data is part of the dataset. I will note down the characteristics of the participants, such as age, gender, and health status.

The **VR experimental environment section** describes the use of two unique street maps (Map A and Map B) for the navigation tasks. This suggests that the experimental conditions and the maps used are part of the dataset. I will extract details about these maps, including their layouts and the specific features that were tested.

In the **data processing section**, the authors mention capturing EEG signals and behavioral data, including walking trajectories, completion times, and homing angles. This indicates that there are multiple datasets related to EEG measurements and navigation performance.

I will also check the **results section** for any specific findings related to the datasets, such as statistical analyses or comparisons between different groups (e.g., fast vs. slow task completion times). This may provide additional context for the datasets.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or methodologies referenced in the paper. This is crucial for providing proper attribution.

Based on this analysis, I will compile the datasets identified, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The datasets will include:

1. **Demographic Data**: Information about the 70 participants, including age and gender.
   - Citation: Not applicable as this is original data collected by the authors.

2. **Virtual Reality Maps**: Details about Map A and Map B used in the navigation tasks.
   - Citation: Not applicable as this is original data created for the study.

3. **EEG Data**: Data collected from the hyperscanning EEG setup during the navigation tasks.
   - Citation: Not applicable as this is original data collected by the authors.

4. **Behavioral Data**: Data on walking trajectories, completion times, and homing angles.
   - Citation: Not applicable as this is original data collected by the authors.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited, ready for further processing or review.
