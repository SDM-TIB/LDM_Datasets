To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quality Diversity through Human Feedback: Towards Open-Ended Diversity-Driven Optimization" by Li Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions empirical studies and benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors describe their experimental setup across three benchmark tasks: robotics, reinforcement learning (RL), and generative modeling. This section is crucial as it typically contains explicit mentions of datasets used for evaluation.

1. **Robotic Arm Dataset**: The authors refer to the robotic arm domain from Cully et al. (2015) and Vassiliades & Mouret (2018). This indicates that there is a specific dataset or environment used for the robotic arm experiments.

2. **Maze Navigation Dataset**: The maze navigation task is based on the Kheperax RL environment, originally proposed in Mouret & Doncieux (2012). This suggests that the authors are using a specific dataset or environment for this task as well.

3. **Latent Space Illumination (LSI) Dataset**: The authors mention using human judgment data from the NIGHTS dataset and the DreamSim model to estimate image similarity, both from Fu et al. (2023). This indicates that the LSI task relies on these datasets for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **Robotic Arm Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cully, A., Clune, J., Tarapore, D., & Mouret, J.-B. (2015). Autonomous skill discovery with quality-diversity and unsupervised descriptors. In Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, pp. 81–89.

- For the **Maze Navigation Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mouret, J.-B., & Doncieux, S. (2012). Encouraging behavioral diversity in evolutionary robotics: An empirical study. Evolutionary Computation, 20(1), 91–133.

- For the **NIGHTS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Fu, S., Tamir, N., Sundaram, S., Chai, L., Zhang, R., Dekel, T., & Isola, P. (2023). Dreamsim: Learning new dimensions of human visual similarity using synthetic data. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 36.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured for future reference or analysis.
