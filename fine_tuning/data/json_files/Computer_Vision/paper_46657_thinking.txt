To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automated 3D cephalometric landmark identification using computerized tomography" by Hye Sun Yun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilized an "anonymized landmark dataset with paired CT data being removed," which suggests that there are specific datasets involved in their study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **results** sections. In the results section, the authors mention using a dataset containing "24 paired data (multi-detector CT images and landmark data) and 229 anonymized landmark data." This is crucial information that indicates the datasets used in their experiments.

I will then extract the details of these datasets:

1. **Paired Dataset**: This dataset consists of 24 paired data points obtained from normal Korean adult volunteers, which includes both CT images and landmark data. The paper notes that this dataset was approved by the local ethics committee, which adds credibility to its use.

2. **Anonymized Landmark Dataset**: This dataset contains 229 anonymized landmark data points acquired in an Excel format from subjects with dentofacial deformities and malocclusions. The authors emphasize that manual landmarking was performed by an expert, which is important for the dataset's reliability.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but it does reference the ethical approval and the expertise of the individuals involved in the landmarking process.

Since the datasets are not associated with specific published papers, I will note that the citations for the datasets are based on the authors' descriptions and the ethical approval they received.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the names, descriptions, and any relevant details about the datasets, along with the context provided in the paper. I will also make a note that the citations are based on the authors' descriptions rather than formal publications.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets and their context as presented in the research paper.
