To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PIE-NeRF: Physics-based Interactive Elastodynamics with NeRF" by Yutao Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate PIE-NeRF with several NeRF scenes and utilize BlenderNeRF to synthesize additional scenes. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluation. They mention using "original NeRF datasets" and "BlenderNeRF" for synthesizing additional scenes. I will need to clarify what the "original NeRF datasets" refer to, as they are not explicitly named in this section.

To gather more information, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to BlenderNeRF, which is a specific dataset, and I will look for its citation. The citation for BlenderNeRF is:

- For **BlenderNeRF**:
  > Maxime Raafat. *BlenderNeRF*, May 2023.

Additionally, I will need to identify what the "original NeRF datasets" are. Since the paper does not specify them directly, I will refer to the foundational paper on NeRF to find the datasets typically used in NeRF experiments. The original NeRF paper is:

- For **NeRF**:
  > Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P. Srinivasan, Matthew Tancik, Jonathan T. Barron, Ravi Ramamoorthi, and Ren Ng. *NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis*. In The European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **BlenderNeRF**: A dataset used for synthesizing additional scenes in the PIE-NeRF experiments.
   - Citation: Maxime Raafat. *BlenderNeRF*, May 2023.

2. **Original NeRF datasets**: While not explicitly named, they refer to datasets typically used in the original NeRF paper.
   - Citation: Ben Mildenhall et al. *NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis*. In The European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2020.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation.
