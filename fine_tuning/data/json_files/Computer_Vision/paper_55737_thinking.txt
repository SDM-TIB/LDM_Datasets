To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CUTS: A Fully Unsupervised Framework for Medical Image Segmentation" by Chen Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their framework on multiple datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly the **Data Preparation** subsection, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will look for explicit mentions of dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant details about how they were used in the study.

In the **Data Preparation section**, the authors mention four datasets:

1. **Berkeley Natural Images**: This dataset consists of 200 labeled training images from the Berkeley image segmentation dataset BSDS300, which is used for evaluation purposes only.

2. **Retinal Fundus Images**: The authors describe a dataset of digitized color fundus photographs (CFPs) from eyes with geographic atrophy (GA) in the age-related eye disease study (AREDS) group. They detail the grading process and the selection of 56 retinal images with accurate segmentations.

3. **Brain MRI Images (Ventricles)**: This dataset includes magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of patients enrolled in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study. The authors mention that they randomly selected 100 T1-weighted brain MRIs for segmentation.

4. **Brain MRI Images (Tumor)**: The authors describe a dataset of MRIs from patients with glioma, consisting of 200 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) brain MRIs, with tumor regions segmented by trained medical students and finalized by a board-certified neuroradiologist.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
