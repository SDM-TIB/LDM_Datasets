To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vidu: a Highly Consistent, Dynamic and Skilled Text-to-Video Generator with Diffusion Models" by Fan Bao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the Vidu model but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation. The introduction discusses the capabilities of Vidu and mentions training on a vast amount of text-video pairs, but it does not specify any particular datasets.

I will then check the **methodology section** and any subsequent sections that might detail the training process or experiments. In this case, the paper does not have a dedicated section labeled "Datasets," so I will need to look for any mentions of datasets throughout the text.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using a high-performance video captioner to automatically annotate training videos, but they do not provide specific names or citations for the datasets used. This indicates that the datasets may not be publicly available or are not explicitly named in the paper.

Since there are no specific datasets mentioned in the text, I will consult the **References section** to see if any cited works refer to datasets. However, the references primarily cite other research papers and do not provide direct citations for datasets.

In conclusion, while the paper discusses the capabilities and training of the Vidu model, it does not provide explicit names or citations for any datasets used. Therefore, I will note that no datasets were extracted from this paper, as the authors did not specify any in the text or references.

I will summarize my findings, noting the absence of dataset information, and prepare to communicate this clearly.
