To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ROSO: Improving Robotic Policy Inference via Synthetic Observations" by Yusuke Miyashita et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of generative AI to enhance robotic policy performance, which may imply the use of specific datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention the tasks and the datasets involved. For instance, they refer to the **Google Scanned Objects dataset** as a source of objects used in their experiments.

I will also check the **related work section** for any references to datasets that might have been used in previous studies that are relevant to their work. This could provide additional context or datasets that are indirectly related to their experiments.

In the **appendix**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the tasks and datasets used, including the specifics of the **CLIPort dataset**. This dataset is crucial as it serves as the baseline for their experiments.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Google Scanned Objects Dataset**:
   > Downs, L., Francis, A., Koenig, N., et al. "Google scanned objects: A high-quality dataset of 3D scanned household items." In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2022.

2. **CLIPort Dataset**:
   > Shridhar, M., Manuelli, L., and Fox, D. "CLIPort: what and where pathways for robotic manipulation." In Proceedings of the 5th Conference on Robot Learning, volume 164, pages 894â€“906. PMLR, 2022.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations, ready for further processing or review.
