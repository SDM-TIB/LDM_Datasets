To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic Equivariant Mixup" by Zongbo Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the proposed method and its empirical studies, which may include mentions of datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on widely used datasets, specifically **CIFAR10 (C10)**, **CIFAR100 (C100)**, and **Tiny-ImageNet (TImage)**. I will note these datasets as they are crucial for understanding the context of the experiments.

I will also check the **experimental setup section** for any additional details about the datasets, such as their characteristics or how they were utilized in the experiments. The authors confirm that they used CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets, which are well-known benchmarks in the field of machine learning.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 

- For **Tiny-ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Chrabaszcz, P., Loshchilov, I., & Hutter, F. (2017). *A downsampled variant of imagenet as an alternative to the cifar datasets*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.08819.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
