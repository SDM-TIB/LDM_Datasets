To extract datasets from the research paper titled "StyLEx: Explaining Style Using Human Lexical Annotations" by Shirley Anugrah Hayati et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the introduction of StyLEx and mentions the use of human-annotated explanations, which suggests that datasets are involved in the training and evaluation of the model.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology sections**, particularly **section 2 (StyLEx: Style Classification with Human Lexical Annotations)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention the **HUMMINGBIRD dataset**, which contains 500 sentences with word-level style annotations. This dataset is crucial for training the StyLEx model.

In the same section, the authors refer to **ORIGINAL datasets**, which are used to curate HUMMINGBIRD. They specify that these datasets include:

1. **Politeness Dataset**: Derived from StackExchange and Wikipedia requests, containing 9,855 training instances.
2. **Sentiment Dataset**: A collection of movie review texts with 117,219 training instances.
3. **Offensiveness Dataset**: Sourced from Twitter, containing 20,680 training instances.
4. **Emotions Dataset**: Collected from tweets, with 6,838 training instances.

Additionally, the authors mention **Out-of-Domain (OOD) datasets** used for evaluating StyLEx's performance across different domains, including:

- Politeness: Enron email corpus.
- Sentiment: Amazon review dataset.
- Offensiveness: OffensEval dataset.
- Emotions: GoEmotions corpus.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned.

Now that I have identified and cited all relevant datasets, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
