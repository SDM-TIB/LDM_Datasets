To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Zero-Shot Generalization for CLIP with Synthesized Prompts" by Zhengbo Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on various tasks, which suggests that multiple datasets may be involved. The introduction elaborates on the challenges of zero-shot learning and references the use of a large dataset of image-text pairs for training CLIP, but I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, particularly the subsections that detail the experimental setup and results. In section 4.1, the authors provide a setup for their experiments, mentioning that they evaluate their method on several datasets. I will look for a list or description of these datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with 1,000 classes, containing 1.28 million training images. It is widely used for image classification tasks.
2. **Caltech101**: This dataset consists of 100 object categories with 4,128 training images.
3. **OxfordPets**: Contains 37 categories of pets with 2,944 training images.
4. **StanfordCars**: A dataset with 196 classes of cars, totaling 6,509 training images.
5. **Flowers102**: This dataset includes 102 categories of flowers with 4,093 training images.
6. **Food101**: Contains 101 categories of food with 50,500 training images.
7. **FGVCAircraft**: A dataset with 100 categories of aircraft, totaling 3,334 training images.
8. **SUN397**: This dataset has 397 scene categories with 15,880 training images.
9. **DTD**: Contains 47 texture categories with 2,820 training images.
10. **EuroSAT**: A dataset for land use classification with 10 categories and 13,500 training images.
11. **UCF101**: A dataset of 101 human action classes from videos, with 7,639 training images.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
