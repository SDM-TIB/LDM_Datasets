To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Engineering Safety in Machine Learning" by Kush R. Varshney, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the importance of safety in machine learning but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction continues this theme, focusing on safety definitions and implications without naming specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections II through V, where the author discusses safety, risk, and machine learning applications. I will look for any references to datasets used in experiments or case studies. However, the paper primarily discusses theoretical concepts and frameworks rather than empirical studies that utilize specific datasets.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations that might indicate datasets used in related works. The references include various studies and papers, but they do not seem to point to specific datasets directly used in the author's research.

Since the paper does not provide explicit datasets or their details, I will note that there are no datasets extracted from this paper. However, I will still compile the references that might be relevant for further exploration of datasets in the context of machine learning safety.

Finally, I will ensure to document the full citations of the references that could be useful for understanding the context of safety in machine learning, even if they do not directly mention datasets.

In summary, I will conclude that this paper does not contain specific datasets but will list the references for further investigation into related works that may involve datasets.
