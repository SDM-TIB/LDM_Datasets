To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpolation-Aware Padding for 3D Sparse Convolutional Neural Networks" by Yu-Qi Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental analysis sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that their method was validated on several large-scale benchmarks, specifically citing **ScanNet**, **KITTI**, and **PartNet**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experimental analysis section** where the authors detail their experiments. Here, they specifically mention the datasets used for segmentation and detection tasks. They describe the **PartNet dataset**, which consists of four categories (Chair, Lamp, Storage furniture, Table) with at least 1000 shapes each. They also mention the **ScanNet dataset**, which contains 1.5k indoor scenes, and the **KITTI dataset**, which is used for semantic segmentation of outdoor scenes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **PartNet Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Kaichun Mo, Shilin Zhu, Angel X. Chang, Li Yi, Subarna Tripathi, Leonidas J. Guibas, and Hao Su. *PartNet: A large-scale benchmark for fine-grained and hierarchical part-level 3D object understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019.

2. **ScanNet Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Angela Dai, Angel X. Chang, Manolis Savva, Maciej Halber, Thomas Funkhouser, and Matthias Nießner. *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

3. **KITTI Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for Autonomous Driving? The KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3354–3361, 2012.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, purpose, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
