To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Point Cloud Pre-training with Diffusion Models" by Xiao Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves substantial improvement across various real-world datasets for downstream tasks, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using **ShapeNet** for pre-training and evaluate their model on several downstream tasks using datasets like **ScanObjectNN**, **S3DIS**, and **ScanNet**.

1. **ShapeNet**: This dataset is described as a synthetic 3D dataset containing 52,470 3D shapes across 55 object categories. It is used for pre-training the model.

2. **ScanObjectNN**: This dataset is utilized for object classification tasks. It is divided into three subsets: OBJ-ONLY, OBJ-BG, and PB-T50-RS, which are used to evaluate the model's performance.

3. **S3DIS**: The Stanford Large-Scale 3D Indoor Spaces dataset is used for semantic segmentation tasks. The authors report results specifically for Area 5 of this dataset.

4. **ScanNet**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of object detection tasks, specifically the ScanNetV2 subset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **ShapeNet**, the citation is:

- For **S3DIS**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
