To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Relation extraction from clinical texts using domain invariant convolutional neural network" by Sunil Kumar Sahu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on the **i2b2-2010 clinical relation extraction challenge dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4 (Dataset and Experimental Settings)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the i2b2 dataset was collected from three different hospitals and manually annotated by medical practitioners for identifying problems, treatments, and tests, along with eight relation types among them. This section provides essential details about the dataset's purpose and structure.

The authors also provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of documents available for training and testing. They note that the original dataset had 394 documents for training and 477 for testing, but they ended up using 170 for training and 256 for testing due to availability issues. This information is critical for understanding the dataset's scope.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the i2b2-2010 dataset. The authors reference the original work that describes the dataset, which is:

- **i2b2-2010 Clinical Relation Extraction Challenge Dataset**:
  > Uzuner, Ã–., South, B. R., Shen, S., & DuVall, S. L. (2011). 2010 i2b2/VA challenge on concepts, assertions, and relations in clinical text. *Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association*, 18(5), 552-556.

Having gathered all this information, I will summarize the dataset details, including its purpose, structure, and citation, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness. This will allow for accurate representation and easy reference in future work.
