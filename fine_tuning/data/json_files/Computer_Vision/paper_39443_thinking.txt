To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Verbal and Non Verbal Signals of Depression - Combining Acoustics, Text and Visuals for Estimating Depression Level" by Syed Arbaaz Qureshi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a benchmark dataset called **Distress Analysis Interview Corpus - a Wizard of Oz (DAIC-WOZ)**, which is a strong indication that this is the primary dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of the dataset in **section 4 (DAIC-WOZ depression dataset)**. Here, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the DAIC-WOZ dataset, including its purpose, structure, and the types of data it contains. They mention that the dataset includes audio and video recordings, questionnaire responses, and various features extracted from the interviews, which confirms its relevance to their study.

In this section, the authors also describe the dataset's composition, stating that it contains **189 sessions of interviews** and detailing the types of files included (e.g., audio files, facial landmark coordinates, gaze features, etc.). This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DAIC-WOZ dataset. The authors reference the dataset as part of a larger corpus, the **Distress Analysis Interview Corpus**, and cite the following paper:

- For **DAIC-WOZ**, the citation is:
  > Jonathan Gratch, Ron Artstein, Gale M Lucas, Giota Stratou, Stefan Scherer, Angela Nazarian, Rachel Wood, Jill Boberg, David DeVault, Stacy Marsella, et al. *The distress analysis interview corpus of human and computer interviews*. In LREC, pages 3123â€“3128, 2014.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will summarize the dataset details and ensure that I include the full citation for the DAIC-WOZ dataset in my final output. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
