To extract datasets from the research paper titled "StylusAI: Stylistic Adaptation for Robust German Handwritten Text Generation" by Nauman Riaz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions the introduction of the **‘Deutscher Handschriften-Datensatz’ (DHSD)**, which is a key dataset for the study. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **IAM Handwriting Database**: This dataset is described as a comprehensive resource for handwriting recognition, containing samples from 657 writers, with a total of 1,539 pages of scanned text. It includes isolated and labeled sentences, lines, and words, making it a rich resource for studying handwriting characteristics.

2. **Deutscher Handschriften-Datensatz (DHSD)**: This is the newly proposed dataset that includes contributions from 37 individuals, each providing an average of 150 words. The dataset is specifically designed to represent the entire German alphabet and is split into training and testing subsets.

In the same section, the authors provide details about how these datasets are used in their experiments, confirming their relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **IAM Handwriting Database**, the citation is:
  > U.V. Marti and H. Bunke. *The IAM Database: An English Sentence Database for Offline Handwriting Recognition*. International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition, 5, 39–46, 2002.

- For the **Deutscher Handschriften-Datensatz (DHSD)**, since it is a newly proposed dataset by the authors, I will cite it as follows:
  > Nauman Riaz, Saifullah Saifullah, Stefan Agne, Andreas Dengel, and Sheraz Ahmed. *Deutscher Handschriften-Datensatz (DHSD)*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
