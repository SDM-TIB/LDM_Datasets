To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HeteroMILE: a Multi-Level Graph Representation Learning Framework for Heterogeneous Graphs" by Yue Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their approach using several popular heterogeneous graph datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this case, the authors explicitly list four datasets used for evaluation in the **experiments section**:

1. **AcademicII**: This dataset includes various entities such as authors, papers, and venues, with specific counts of nodes and edges provided.
2. **DBLP**: Similar to AcademicII, this dataset contains authors, papers, terms, and venues, along with their respective counts.
3. **IMDB**: This dataset consists of movies, directors, and actors, with detailed node and edge counts.
4. **OGB MAG**: This is a large dataset reflecting relationships between authors, institutions, papers, and fields, also with specific counts.

I will then gather the detailed information about each dataset, including the number of nodes and edges, as presented in the paper.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be included in the dataset descriptions.

For example, the citations might look like this (hypothetical citations for illustration):

- **AcademicII**: 
  > Zhang, Y., et al. *AcademicII: A Dataset for Academic Graph Representation Learning*. In Proceedings of the XYZ Conference, 2022.

- **DBLP**: 
  > Ley, M. *DBLP: A Computer Science Bibliography*. In Proceedings of the ABC Conference, 2002.

- **IMDB**: 
  > IMDb. *The Internet Movie Database*. Available at: https://www.imdb.com.

- **OGB MAG**: 
  > Hu, W., et al. *Open Graph Benchmark: Datasets for Machine Learning on Graphs*. In Proceedings of the DEF Conference, 2020.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, the number of nodes and edges, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
