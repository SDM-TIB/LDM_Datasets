To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Posterior Sampling with Denoising Oracles via Tilted Transport" by Joan Bruna and Jiequn Han, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of score-based diffusion models and posterior sampling, which may imply the use of datasets, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 8) where datasets are likely to be detailed. I will look for any references to datasets used for validation or testing the proposed methods. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided about them.

In the **case studies section (Section 6)**, the authors discuss various models, including Gaussian mixtures and Ising models. I will check if they reference any datasets used in these models or any experimental setups that involve datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "Flickr-Faces-HQ Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If it is not explicitly cited, I will search for the original source of the dataset online to provide a complete citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset's details.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methods sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments and case studies sections for specific datasets used.
3. Check the references for full citations of each dataset mentioned.
4. Compile the dataset information, including names, descriptions, and citations, into a clear format for easy reference.
