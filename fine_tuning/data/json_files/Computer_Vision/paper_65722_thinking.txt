To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DiffRef3D: A Diffusion-based Proposal Refinement Framework for 3D Object Detection" by Se-Ho Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate the significance of their framework through extensive experiments on the **KITTI benchmark**, indicating that this is a dataset used in their research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the application of diffusion models to 3D object detection but primarily focuses on the framework itself rather than listing datasets.

Moving on to the **experiments** section, I will look for a dedicated subsection that discusses the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention the **KITTI benchmark** as the primary dataset for their experiments. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its composition and relevance to the study.

In the **experiments** section, the authors provide a detailed description of the **KITTI benchmark**, stating that it consists of 7,481 LiDAR samples for training and 7,518 samples for testing, with a breakdown of training samples into a training set and a validation set. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and usage in their experiments.

Finally, I will check the **References** section to find the full citation for the **KITTI benchmark**. The citation is as follows:
> Geiger, A., Lenz, P., & Urtasun, R. (2012). Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite. In 2012 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 3354â€“3361. IEEE.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. The dataset extracted from the paper is the **KITTI benchmark**, and I will ensure that the citation is included in any final output or documentation.
