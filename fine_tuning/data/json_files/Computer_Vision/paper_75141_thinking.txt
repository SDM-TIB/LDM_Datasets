To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Do Generalised Classifiers really work on Human Drawn Sketches?" by Hmrishav Bandyopadhyay et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions using sketches from **QuickDraw**, **TU-Berlin**, and **Edgemaps**, which indicates that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the paper, the authors describe the datasets in detail in **section 5 (Experiments)**, where they provide specific information about each dataset:

1. **QuickDraw**: This dataset contains 50 million sketches across 345 categories. It is noted for its high abstraction level, as sketches are drawn quickly (under 20 seconds).

2. **TU-Berlin**: This dataset consists of 20,000 sketches from 250 categories. It is characterized as having medium abstraction, with sketches drawn in a more extended time frame (up to 280 seconds).

3. **Edgemaps**: This dataset is generated from 204,000 images in the TU-Berlin extended dataset, providing low abstraction sketches. The authors mention that Edgemaps are created using a specific method referenced in the paper.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

- For **QuickDraw**, the citation is:
  > Ha, D., & Eck, D. (2018). *A Neural Representation of Sketch Drawings*. In ICLR.

- For **TU-Berlin**, the citation is:
  > Eitz, M., Hays, J., & Alexa, M. (2012). *How Do Humans Sketch Objects?* ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 31(4), 1-10.

- For **Edgemaps**, the citation is:
  > Bhunia, A.K., Chowdhury, P.N., Yang, Y., Hospedales, T.M., Xiang, T., & Song, Y.Z. (2021). *Vectorization and Rasterization: Self-Supervised Learning for Sketch and Handwriting*. In CVPR.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
