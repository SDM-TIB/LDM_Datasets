To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Forensic Analysis of Synthetically Generated Western Blot Images" by Sara Mandelli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors created a new dataset comprising more than 14,000 original western blot images and 24,000 synthetic western blot images. This is a clear indication that a dataset is present.

Next, I will look into **Section II (Synthetic Western Blot Generation)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the dataset includes:

1. **Original Western Blot Images**: A total of 14,200 real images collected from various sources, including scientific publications and online resources.
2. **Synthetic Western Blot Images**: A total of 24,000 synthetic images generated using four different generative models, specifically:
   - Pix2pix
   - CycleGAN
   - StyleGAN2-ADA
   - Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)

The paper provides a breakdown of how these synthetic images were generated, but it does not provide specific citations for the original images used in the dataset. However, it does mention that the original images were sourced from scientific literature and online databases.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The authors do not provide specific citations for the original images, but they do reference several papers related to the generative models used for creating synthetic images. I will note these references as they pertain to the methods used to generate the synthetic dataset.

The relevant citations for the generative models are:

- For **Pix2pix**:
  > Isola, P., Zhu, J.-Y., Zhou, T., & Efros, A. A. (2017). *Image-to-image translation with conditional adversarial networks*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For **CycleGAN**:
  > Zhu, J.-Y., Park, T., Isola, P., & Efros, A. A. (2017). *Unpaired image-to-image translation using cycle-consistent adversarial networks*. In IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

- For **StyleGAN2-ADA**:
  > Karras, T., Laine, S., & Aila, T. (2020). *Analyzing and improving the image quality of StyleGAN*. In IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For **DDPM**:
  > Dhariwal, P., & Nichol, A. Q. (2021). *Diffusion models beat GANs on image synthesis*. In 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the generative models used to create the synthetic images, as well as a note about the original images without specific citations.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
