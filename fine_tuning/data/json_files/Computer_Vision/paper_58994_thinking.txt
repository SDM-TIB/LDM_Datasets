To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Instruction Clarification Requests in Multimodal Collaborative Dialogue Games: Tasks, and an Analysis of the CoDraw Dataset" by Brielen Madureira and David Schlangen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data and annotation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors annotate Instruction Clarification Requests (iCRs) in the CoDraw dataset, which suggests that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors reference the CoDraw dataset and describe its purpose and characteristics, which confirms its significance in their work.

In the **data and annotation section**, the authors provide detailed information about the CoDraw dataset, including its size (9,993 dialogues), the nature of the interactions, and the annotation process for iCRs. This section is crucial as it provides the necessary details about the dataset's structure and content.

I will also check the **related literature section** to see if any other datasets are mentioned. The authors reference several other datasets, but they primarily focus on the CoDraw dataset for their analysis.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The primary dataset is:

1. **CoDraw Dataset**: 
   - Citation: 
     > Kim, J.-H., Kitaev, N., Chen, X., Rohrbach, M., Zhang, B.-T., Tian, Y., Batra, D., & Parikh, D. (2019). CoDraw: Collaborative drawing as a testbed for grounded goal-driven communication. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (pp. 6495â€“6513). Florence, Italy: Association for Computational Linguistics.

The authors also mention other datasets in the context of related work, but the CoDraw dataset is the primary focus of their research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset information in the required format, ensuring that the full citations are included for each dataset identified.
