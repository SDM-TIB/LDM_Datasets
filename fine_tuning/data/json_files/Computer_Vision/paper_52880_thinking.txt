To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An End-to-end Supervised Domain Adaptation Framework for Cross-Domain Change Detection" by Jia Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the framework was validated on two benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this case, the authors explicitly mention two datasets: 

1. **CDD Dataset**: The paper describes it as a widely used dataset for change detection, containing 11 pairs of bi-temporal images obtained from Google Earth. The dataset has a spatial resolution ranging from 3 to 100 cm per pixel and was cropped to generate 10,000 image pairs for training, 3,000 for validation, and 3,000 for testing.

2. **WHU Building Dataset**: This dataset focuses on changes in buildings and consists of one pair of very high-resolution images with a spatial resolution of 0.075 m per pixel. The authors mention that the original image pair was divided into a training set of 21,243 pixels and a testing set of 11,265 pixels.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **CDD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. A. Lebedev, Yu. V. Vizilter, O. V. Vygolov, V. A. Knyaz, and A. Yu. Rubis. *Change Detection in Remote Sensing Images Using Conditional Adversarial Networks*. International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing & Spatial Information Sciences, 42, 2 (2018).

- For the **WHU Building Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shunping Ji, Shiqing Wei, and Meng Lu. *Fully Convolutional Networks for Multisource Building Extraction from an Open Aerial and Satellite Imagery Data Set*. IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 57, 1 (2019), 574â€“586.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
