To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Text2FaceGAN: Face Generation from Fine Grained Textual Descriptions" by Osaid Rehman Nasir et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the creation of captions for images in the **CelebA dataset**, indicating that this dataset is crucial for the research. The introduction further elaborates on the challenges of face generation from textual descriptions and highlights the need for a dataset that includes fine-grained attributes.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets, particularly the **methodology** and **experiments** sections. In the methodology, the authors describe how they generated captions for the **CelebA dataset** based on facial attributes. This dataset is central to their approach, as it allows them to synthesize faces from textual descriptions.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using the **CelebA dataset** for training their GAN model, confirming its significance in their research. They also discuss the limitations of other datasets like **Face2Text**, which only contains 400 images and lacks the necessary diversity for effective training.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **CelebA Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. 2015.

2. **Face2Text Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Albert Gatt, Marc Tanti, Adrian Muscat, Patrizia Paggio, Reuben A Farrugia, Claudia Borg, Kenneth P Camilleri, Mike Rosner, and Lonneke Van der Plas. *Face2Text: Collecting an Annotated Image Description Corpus for the Generation of Rich Face Descriptions*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1803.03827, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
