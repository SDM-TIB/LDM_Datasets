To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Normalized Label Distribution: Towards Learning Calibrated, Adaptable and Efficient Activation Maps" by Utkarsh Uppal and Bharat Giddwani, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the significance of their approach and mention conducting experiments on a "skewed stubble burning dataset" and the "CIFAR10 dataset." This indicates that these two datasets are relevant to their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods or experiments sections**. The paper describes the skewed stubble burning dataset, which contains 858 images divided into three classes: normal farm, farm with burning stubble, and general fire cases. The images are consistently sized at 224x224 pixels. This dataset is crucial for understanding the authors' experiments.

The paper also mentions the **CIFAR10 dataset**, which is a well-known benchmark dataset in the field of computer vision. It is important to note that while the authors use this dataset, they do not provide specific details about its usage in this paper.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **CIFAR10 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

2. For the **skewed stubble burning dataset**, since it appears to be a dataset created by the authors for their specific experiments, I will note that it does not have a formal citation in the references. However, I will describe it in detail as it is essential for their research.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for CIFAR10 and a detailed description for the skewed stubble burning dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study.
