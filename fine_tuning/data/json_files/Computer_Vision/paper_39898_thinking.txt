To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative Adversarial Networks for Operational Scenario Planning of Renewable Energy Farms: A Study on Wind and Photovoltaic" by Jens Schreiber et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves two wind and two solar datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Set-Up and Evaluation)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Data)**, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **EuropeWindFarm2015**: This dataset consists of data from 32 wind parks with a total of 414,720 samples and a resolution of 1 hour (24 measurements per day).

2. **GermanSolarFarm2015**: This dataset includes data from 16 solar farms, totaling 972,800 samples with a resolution of 3 hours (8 measurements per day).

3. **GermanWindFarm2017**: This dataset features data from 48 wind parks, with 490,752 samples and a resolution of 1 hour (24 measurements per day). It is noted that this dataset is not publicly available.

4. **GermanSolarFarm2017**: This dataset contains data from 48 solar farms, totaling 185,472 samples with a resolution of 3 hours (8 measurements per day). This dataset is also not publicly available.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets that are publicly available. However, since the GermanWindFarm2017 and GermanSolarFarm2017 datasets are not publicly available, I will only provide citations for the other datasets if they are referenced in the literature.

The citations for the publicly available datasets are as follows:

- For **EuropeWindFarm2015** and **GermanSolarFarm2015**, the authors do not provide specific citations in the paper, but they mention that these datasets can be obtained from their website.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the necessary details and citations where applicable. 

In summary, I will extract the datasets as follows:

1. **EuropeWindFarm2015**: 32 parks, 414,720 samples, 1-hour resolution.
2. **GermanSolarFarm2015**: 16 farms, 972,800 samples, 3-hour resolution.
3. **GermanWindFarm2017**: 48 parks, 490,752 samples, 1-hour resolution (not publicly available).
4. **GermanSolarFarm2017**: 48 farms, 185,472 samples, 3-hour resolution (not publicly available).

Finally, I will ensure that the information is structured clearly for any further processing or review.
