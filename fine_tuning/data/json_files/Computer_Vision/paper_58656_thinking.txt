To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SCONNA: A Stochastic Computing Based Optical Accelerator for Ultra-Fast, Energy-Efficient Inference of Integer-Quantized CNNs" by Sairam Sri Vatsavai et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments or evaluation section** of the paper, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for testing their proposed methods. In this paper, I will look for any specific datasets that are referenced or described in detail.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using a **custom dataset** for their experiments, but they do not provide a specific name or citation for it. They also refer to the **ImageNet validation dataset** for evaluating the inference accuracy of their models. This is a well-known dataset in the field of computer vision.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The citation for the ImageNet dataset is:

- **ImageNet**: 
  > J. Deng et al., "Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database," in CVPR, 2009.

Since the paper does not provide a citation for the custom dataset, I will note that it is not available for citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the ImageNet dataset while noting the absence of a citation for the custom dataset.

This process ensures that I accurately extract and cite the datasets mentioned in the research paper, adhering to the importance of proper citation in academic work.
