To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "On the Complementarity between Pre-Training and Random-Initialization for Resource-Rich Machine Translation" by Changtong Zan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experimental setup, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two resource-rich translation benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of pre-training (PT) and random-initialization (RI) in resource-rich scenarios and mention the WMT evaluations. This hints at the datasets used but does not provide specific names yet.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they conducted experiments on two widely-used benchmarks: **WMT17 English-Chinese** and **WMT19 English-German**. This is a clear identification of the datasets.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The WMT datasets are typically associated with the annual Conference on Machine Translation (WMT), so I will look for the relevant citations:

1. For **WMT17 English-Chinese**, the citation is:
   > Farhad Akhbardeh, Arkady Arkhangorodsky, Magdalena Biesialska, Ondej Bojar, Rajen Chatterjee, Vishrav Chaudhary, Marta R. Costa-jussa, Cristina Espaa-Bonet, Angela Fan, Christian Federmann, Markus Freitag, Yvette Graham, Roman Grundkiewicz, Barry Haddow, Leonie Harter, Kenneth Heaﬁeld, Christopher Homan, Matthias Huck, Kwabena Amponsah-Kaakyire, Jungo Kasai, Daniel Khashabi, Kevin Knight, Tom Kocmi, Philipp Koehn, Nicholas Lourie, Christof Monz, Makoto Morishita, Masaaki Nagata, Ajay Nagesh, Toshiaki Nakazawa, Matteo Negri, Santanu Pal, Allahsera Auguste Tapo, Marco Turchi, Valentin Vydrin, and Marcos Zampieri. *Findings of the 2021 conference on machine translation (wmt21)*. In WMT, 2021.

2. For **WMT19 English-German**, the citation is:
   > Farhad Akhbardeh, Arkady Arkhangorodsky, Magdalena Biesialska, Ondej Bojar, Rajen Chatterjee, Vishrav Chaudhary, Marta R. Costa-jussa, Cristina Espaa-Bonet, Angela Fan, Christian Federmann, Markus Freitag, Yvette Graham, Roman Grundkiewicz, Barry Haddow, Leonie Harter, Kenneth Heaﬁeld, Christopher Homan, Matthias Huck, Kwabena Amponsah-Kaakyire, Jungo Kasai, Daniel Khashabi, Kevin Knight, Tom Kocmi, Philipp Koehn, Nicholas Lourie, Christof Monz, Makoto Morishita, Masaaki Nagata, Ajay Nagesh, Toshiaki Nakazawa, Matteo Negri, Santanu Pal, Allahsera Auguste Tapo, Marco Turchi, Valentin Vydrin, and Marcos Zampieri. *Findings of the 2021 conference on machine translation (wmt21)*. In WMT, 2021.

With these citations, I have successfully identified and documented the datasets used in the paper. Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
