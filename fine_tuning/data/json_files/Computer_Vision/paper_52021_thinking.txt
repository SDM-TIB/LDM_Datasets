To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Structural Sparsity in Neural Image Compression" by Shanzhi Yin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the implementation of the proposed method on three neural image compression networks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** to identify any datasets used for training or evaluation. In this section, the authors mention using the **CLIC dataset** for training their models and the **Kodak dataset** for evaluation. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their research.

I will then look for specific details about these datasets. The authors provide a brief mention of the CLIC dataset and the Kodak dataset, but I need to ensure I have the full citations for both.

To find the full citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. Here, I will locate the entries corresponding to the CLIC dataset and the Kodak dataset:

1. **CLIC Dataset**: The citation is:
   > CLIC Dataset. Available at: http://compression.cc/

2. **Kodak Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Kodak Dataset. Available at: http://r0k.us/graphics/kodak/

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

- **CLIC Dataset**: Used for training the models. The dataset can be accessed at the provided link.
- **Kodak Dataset**: Used for evaluating the models. The dataset can also be accessed at the provided link.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete for future reference or processing.
