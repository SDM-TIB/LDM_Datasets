To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EDMP: Ensemble-of-costs-guided Diffusion for Motion Planning" by Kallol Saha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors propose a method that combines classical planning and deep learning, and it hints at the use of a dataset for training. This suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the relevant information is found in **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for benchmarking their method. They specifically mention the **MπNets dataset**, which consists of 6.54 million collision-free trajectories generated from various scenes.

I will extract the details about the dataset as follows:

1. **MπNets Dataset**: The paper states that the training dataset consists of 6.54 million collision-free trajectories generated on various scenes using two different classical planning pipelines. The test dataset is divided into three categories: Global Solvable Problems, Hybrid Solvable Problems, and Both Solvable Problems, each containing 1800 scenes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MπNets dataset. The paper cites the original work that introduced the MπNets dataset:

- For the **MπNets dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Fishman, A. Murali, C. Eppner, B. Peele, B. Boots, and D. Fox. *Motion Policy Networks*. In Conference on Robot Learning, PMLR, 2023, pp. 967–977.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and their citations clearly. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary information for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
