To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Complex-Valued Autoencoders for Object Discovery" by Sindy LÃ¶we et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on "simple multi-object datasets," which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used. In **section 4.1 (Setup)**, the authors explicitly list three datasets:

1. **2Shapes Dataset**: This dataset consists of images containing two randomly placed shapes (a square and a triangle) in each image. The authors mention generating 50,000 training images and 10,000 images for validation and testing.

2. **3Shapes Dataset**: Similar to the 2Shapes dataset, but it includes a third randomly placed shape, making it slightly more complex. The same number of images is generated for training, validation, and testing.

3. **MNIST&Shape Dataset**: This dataset combines MNIST digits with randomly placed shapes, creating a more challenging setting. The authors also generate 50,000 training images and 10,000 images for validation and testing.

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **2Shapes Dataset**, there is no specific citation as it is a synthetic dataset created by the authors for their experiments.

- For the **3Shapes Dataset**, similarly, it is a synthetic dataset created by the authors and does not have a separate citation.

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and CJ Burges. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. ATT Labs [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist, 2010.

Since the 2Shapes and 3Shapes datasets are not standard datasets with published citations, I will note that they are created by the authors for the purpose of this research.

Now, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and citations:

1. **2Shapes Dataset**: A synthetic dataset consisting of images with two randomly placed shapes (a square and a triangle). 
   - Citation: None (created by authors).

2. **3Shapes Dataset**: A synthetic dataset consisting of images with three randomly placed shapes (two triangles and one square).
   - Citation: None (created by authors).

3. **MNIST&Shape Dataset**: A dataset combining MNIST digits with randomly placed shapes, generating a more complex scenario for object discovery.
   - Citation: Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and CJ Burges. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. ATT Labs [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist, 2010.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
