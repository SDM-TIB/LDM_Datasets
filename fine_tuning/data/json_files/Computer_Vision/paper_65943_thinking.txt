To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revealing CNN Architectures via Side-Channel Analysis in Dataflow-based Inference Accelerators" by Hansika Weerasena and Prabhat Mishra, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experimental sections typically detail the datasets employed in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that were utilized in the experiments or any benchmarks that the authors compared their results against. This section may also provide insights into the types of datasets relevant to the study.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as it usually contains explicit mentions of the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for any tables, figures, or descriptions that outline the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture all necessary details, such as authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

For this paper, I will specifically look for datasets related to CNN architectures or benchmarks that are commonly used in the context of CNN model evaluation. If the authors mention specific datasets like ImageNet, CIFAR-10, or others, I will note those down.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation formatted correctly. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will organize the extracted information in a clear and concise manner, ready for any further processing or review.
