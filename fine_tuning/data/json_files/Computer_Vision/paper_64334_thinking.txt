To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DF-TransFusion: Multimodal Deepfake Detection via Lip-Audio Cross-Attention and Facial Self-Attention" by Aaditya Kharel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for datasets that include both audio and video modalities for deepfake detection, which suggests that specific datasets will be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **related work section** (Section 2), where the authors summarize existing datasets. Here, they mention several datasets, including:

1. **UADFV**: This dataset is referenced as containing 98 videos of deepfakes.
2. **DF-TIMIT**: This dataset includes audio and video deepfakes, with 320 videos.
3. **Face Forensics++**: This dataset contains 5,000 videos.
4. **CelebDF**: This dataset has 1,203 videos.
5. **DFDC**: This dataset features 119,146 videos with both audio and video modalities.
6. **Deeper Forensics 1.0**: This dataset includes 60,000 videos.
7. **FakeAVCeleb**: This dataset contains 21,566 videos with both audio and video modalities.

I will then verify the details of these datasets in the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors confirm that they used **DFDC**, **DF-TIMIT**, and **FakeAVCeleb** for their experiments. This confirms their relevance and importance in the context of the study.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. Here are the citations I will extract:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
