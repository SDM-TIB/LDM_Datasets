To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SAM4UDASS: When SAM Meets Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation in Intelligent Vehicles" by Weihao Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on synthetic-to-real and normal-to-adverse driving datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **GTA5 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 24,966 annotated images sourced from the video game Grand Theft Auto V, with a resolution of 1914 × 1052.

2. **SYNTHIA Dataset**: This dataset includes 9,400 photo-realistic frames generated from a virtual city environment, with a resolution of 1280 × 760.

3. **Cityscapes Dataset**: This dataset comprises 2,975 training images, 500 validation images, and 1,525 test images, all precisely annotated and taken from diverse urban street scenes across 50 different cities.

4. **ACDC Dataset**: This dataset is designed for semantic understanding in challenging visual conditions and includes 1,000 images each for foggy, nighttime, rainy, and snowy conditions, all annotated at a resolution of 1920 × 1080.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, along with their full citations for reference.
