To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Graph Convolution for Analyzing Brain Structural and Functional Connectome" by Yueting Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used data from the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) to predict age and sex based on functional and micro-structural white-matter networks. This suggests that NCANDA is a key dataset.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **method** and **experimental settings** sections. In the **experimental settings** section, the authors mention using longitudinal rs-fMRI and DTI data from **662 NCANDA participants**. They provide additional context about the participants, including their age range and the number of scans collected, which further confirms the dataset's relevance.

I will also check the **acknowledgment** and **references** sections for any additional datasets or related studies that might provide further context or citations. The authors reference multiple data releases from NCANDA, which are crucial for proper citation.

The specific datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **NCANDA Dataset**: This dataset includes longitudinal neuroimaging data (rs-fMRI and DTI) from 662 participants, which is central to the study's analysis.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the NCANDA dataset from the references section. The relevant citations are:

- For the NCANDA dataset, the citation is:
  > Brown, S., Brumback, T., Tomlinson, K., Cummins, K., Thompson, W., Nagel, B., de Bellis, M., Hooper, S., Clark, D., Chung, T., Hasler, B., Colrain, I., Baker, F., Prouty, D., Pfefferbaum, A., Sullivan, E., Pohl, K. (2015).

- For the specific NCANDA data releases, the citations are:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for clarity and proper attribution.
