To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Segmentation-guided MRI reconstruction for meaningfully diverse reconstructions" by Jan Nikolas Morshuis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions the use of a method that generates reconstructions based on MRI data, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.3 (Data and models)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for training and testing their method. Here, they specifically mention the **SKM-TEA dataset**, which is publicly available and used for their experiments. The authors provide details about the dataset, including its focus on E1-echoes and the number of slices analyzed.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SKM-TEA dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

> Desai, A.D., Schmidt, A.M., Rubin, E.B., Sandino, C.M., Black, M.S., Mazzoli, V., Stevens, K.J., Boutin, R., Re, C., Gold, G.E., et al. *SKM-TEA: A dataset for accelerated MRI reconstruction with dense image labels for quantitative clinical evaluation*. In: NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks Track (Round 2) (2021).

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will document it accordingly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that the full citation is included, as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference in future work.
