To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic and Effective Communication for Remote Control Tasks with Dynamic Feature Compression" by Pietro Talli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses a prototypal system and mentions testing on the **CartPole reference control problem**, which suggests that there may be a dataset associated with this problem.

Next, I will look closely at **section IV (Numerical Evaluation)**, where the authors describe the CartPole problem in detail. They mention that the problem is implemented using the **OpenAI Gym library**, which indicates that the dataset used for this problem is part of the OpenAI Gym environment.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the OpenAI Gym, as it is crucial to provide proper attribution for the dataset used in the experiments. The citation for the OpenAI Gym is:

- **OpenAI Gym**: 
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. H., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets or provide additional datasets for evaluation, I will conclude that the only dataset referenced is the one associated with the CartPole problem from the OpenAI Gym.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for clarity and completeness. This ensures that all necessary information is captured and properly attributed.
