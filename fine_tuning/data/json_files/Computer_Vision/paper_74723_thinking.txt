To extract datasets from the research paper titled "General Binding Affinity Guidance for Diffusion Models in Structure-Based Drug Design" by Yue Jian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a method called BADGER for improving ligand binding affinity, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction provides context about structure-based drug design (SBDD) and mentions the importance of binding affinity, but again, no specific datasets are named.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Results and Discussion)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset and Model Baselines)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they state that they used the **CrossDocked2020** dataset for all experiments. This is a crucial finding, as it indicates the dataset utilized in their research.

In this subsection, the authors describe the dataset in detail, mentioning that it consists of 22.5 million docked protein-ligand complexes filtered based on specific criteria, and they selected 100,000 complexes for training and 100 for testing. This detailed description helps in understanding the dataset's scope and application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **CrossDocked2020** dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> Paul G Francoeur, Tomohide Masuda, Jocelyn Sunseri, Andrew Jia, Richard B Iovanisci, Ian Snyder, and David R Koes. *Three-dimensional convolutional neural networks and a cross-docked data set for structure-based drug design*. Journal of chemical information and modeling, 60(9):4200â€“4215, 2020.

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the dataset extraction process:

1. **Identify Sections**: Focus on the abstract, introduction, and results sections to locate dataset mentions.
2. **Extract Dataset Names**: Note down any datasets explicitly mentioned, such as **CrossDocked2020**.
3. **Gather Dataset Details**: Collect relevant details about the dataset, including size, filtering criteria, and usage in experiments.
4. **Find Full Citations**: Look in the references for complete citations of the datasets mentioned.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation.
