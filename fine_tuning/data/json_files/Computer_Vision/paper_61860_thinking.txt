To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhance-NeRF: Multiple Performance Evaluation for Neural Radiance Fields" by Qianqiu Tan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets used in prior work.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experimental Results)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they describe two datasets:

1. **Tanks and Temples Dataset**: This dataset is used to evaluate the method, specifically for outdoor scenes with significant light reflections. The authors note that each scene contains approximately 300 images.

2. **Mixed Sampling Dataset**: This dataset is created from various input forms, including images captured by a DJI Mini 3 Pro drone and mobile phone. It includes 200 to 300 images per dataset and aims to reflect real shooting habits.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Tanks and Temples Dataset**, the citation is:
> Arno Knapitsch et al. "Tanks and temples: Benchmarking large-scale scene reconstruction." In: ACM Transactions on Graphics (ToG) 36.4 (2017), pp. 1–13.

For the **Mixed Sampling Dataset**, since it is a custom dataset created by the authors, it may not have a formal citation. However, I will note that it includes images from the **garden dataset from Mip-NeRF** and the **poster dataset from Nerfacto**, so I will also look for their citations.

The citation for the **Mip-NeRF dataset** is:
> Jonathan T Barron et al. "Mip-nerf: A multiscale representation for anti-aliasing neural radiance fields." In: Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision. 2021, pp. 5855–5864.

The citation for the **Nerfacto dataset** is:
> Matthew Tancik et al. "Nerfacto: Neural radiance fields for fast scene reconstruction." In: Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2022, pp. 8248–8258.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
