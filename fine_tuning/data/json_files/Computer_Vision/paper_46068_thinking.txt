To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Output Feedback Control of Coupled Linear Parabolic ODE-PDE-ODE Systems" by Joachim Deutscher and Nicole Gehring, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Experiments," "Results," or "Datasets."** In this paper, I will focus on the sections that detail the experiments conducted, as they often describe the datasets used for validation or testing.

I will pay attention to any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors refer to any datasets, I will note down their descriptions carefully.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its full citation in the references. If the dataset is not directly cited, I will search for the original source of the dataset based on the information provided in the paper.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and structured manner, ready for further processing or review.
