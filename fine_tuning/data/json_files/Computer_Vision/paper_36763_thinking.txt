To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Split-Brain Autoencoders: Unsupervised Learning by Cross-Channel Prediction" by Richard Zhang, Phillip Isola, and Alexei A. Efros, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions that the method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several large-scale transfer learning benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In **Section 4.1**, they mention using the **ImageNet dataset** for training their models. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed method.

In **Section 4.2**, they discuss applying their method to the **NYU-D dataset**, which contains RGB-D images. This dataset is also significant as it is used to evaluate the effectiveness of their approach in a different domain.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **ImageNet dataset**, the citation is:
   > O. Russakovsky, J. Deng, H. Su, J. Krause, S. Satheesh, S. Ma, Z. Huang, A. Karpathy, A. Khosla, M. Bernstein, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211–252, 2015.

2. For the **NYU-D dataset**, the citation is:
   > N. Silberman, D. Hoiem, P. Kohli, and R. Fergus. *Indoor Segmentation and Support Inference from RGBD Images*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 746–760. Springer, 2012.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
