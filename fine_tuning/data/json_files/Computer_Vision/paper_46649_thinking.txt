To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Boundary-Aware Segmentation Network for Mobile and Web Applications" by Xuebin Qin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on two reverse tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically section 4.3) where the authors detail their evaluations. Here, they explicitly mention using the following datasets for salient object segmentation:

1. **DUTS-TR Dataset**: This dataset is used for training and contains 10,553 images, which were augmented to 21,106 images through horizontal flipping.

2. **DUTS-TE Dataset**: This dataset is used for testing and contains 5,019 images.

3. **SOD Dataset**: A dataset with 300 challenging images for salient object detection.

4. **ECSSD Dataset**: This dataset contains 1,000 semantically meaningful images.

5. **DUT-OMRON Dataset**: This dataset has 5,168 images with one or multiple objects, many of which are structurally complex.

6. **PASCAL-S Dataset**: Originally created for semantic segmentation, this dataset consists of 850 challenging images.

7. **HKU-IS Dataset**: This dataset contains 4,447 images, many of which have multiple foreground objects.

8. **SOC Dataset**: This dataset is used for testing and contains 600 images with salient objects.

In section 4.4, the authors also mention datasets used for camouflaged object segmentation:

1. **CHAMELEON Dataset**: Contains 76 images marked as good examples of camouflaged animals.

2. **CAMO Dataset**: This dataset has both camouflaged and non-camouflaged subsets, with the camouflaged subset containing 1,000 images for training and 250 images for testing.

3. **COD10K Dataset**: The largest camouflaged object detection dataset, comprising 10,000 images of 78 object categories, with 5,066 images densely labeled with accurate binary masks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve full citations for these datasets:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
