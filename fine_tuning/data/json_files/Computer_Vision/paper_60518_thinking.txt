To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Causal Effect Estimation with Variational AutoEncoder and the Front Door Criterion" by Ziqi Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors applied their method to **three real-world datasets**, which indicates that there are specific datasets I need to identify.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors describe their evaluation process. In this section, they explicitly mention the three real-world datasets they used:

1. **Sachs Dataset**: This dataset contains 853 samples and 11 variables. The treatment is Erk, and the outcome is the concentration of Akt. The reference causal effect is provided along with a confidence interval.

2. **401k Dataset**: This dataset consists of 9,275 individuals and 11 variables, derived from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). The treatment is p401k, and the outcome is pira, with a reference causal effect and confidence interval mentioned.

3. **SchoolingReturns Dataset**: This dataset includes 3,010 records and 19 variables. The treatment is the education level of a person, and the outcome is raw wages in 1976. The reference causal effect and confidence interval are also provided.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Sachs Dataset**:
  > Sachs, K., Perez, O., Peâ€™er, D., Lauffenburger, D. A., & Nolan, G. P. (2005). Causal protein-signaling networks derived from multiparameter single-cell data. *Science*, 308(5721), 523-529.

- For the **401k Dataset**:
  > Chernozhukov, V., & Hansen, C. (2004). The impact of 401(k) participation on the wealth distribution: An instrumental quantile regression analysis. *Review of Economics and Statistics*, 86(3), 735-751.

- For the **SchoolingReturns Dataset**:
  > Card, D. (1995). Using geographical variation in college proximity to estimate the return to schooling. In *Aspects of Labor Market Behavior: Essays in Honor of John Vanderkamp* (pp. 201-222). University of Toronto Press.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
