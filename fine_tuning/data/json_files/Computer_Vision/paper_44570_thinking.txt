To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Text Classification Based on Multi-Granularity Attention Hybrid Neural Network" by Zhenyu Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on a variety of datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets**, which is typically where authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. In this case, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Study)**, as it is likely to contain the relevant information about the datasets.

In **section 4.1 (Experiments Datasets)**, the authors provide a summary table (Table 1) that lists several datasets along with their characteristics. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **MR (Movie Review Dataset)**: A dataset containing short movie reviews labeled with sentiment polarity (positive or negative).
2. **Subj (Subjectivity Dataset)**: A dataset containing sentences labeled as subjective or objective.
3. **MPQA (Multi-Perspective Question Answering Dataset)**: A dataset for opinion polarity detection.
4. **SST-1 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)**: An extension of the MR dataset with fine-grained sentiment labels.
5. **SST-2**: Similar to SST-1 but with neutral reviews removed, providing binary labels.

I will then confirm the details of these datasets by checking the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. 

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
