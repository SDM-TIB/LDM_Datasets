To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Echoes in the Noise: Posterior Samples of Faint Galaxy Surface Brightness Profiles with Score-Based Likelihoods and Priors" by Alexandre Adam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a framework for Bayesian analysis of image deconvolution, which suggests that datasets related to galaxy images are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of analyzing galaxy populations and refer to various imaging campaigns. This indicates that there may be specific datasets used for their analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe their approach to using datasets. Here, they mention two key datasets:

1. **PROBES Dataset**: This dataset is described as a compendium of high-quality local late-type galaxies, which have resolved structures suitable for approximating high-resolution galaxy light profiles. The authors note that this dataset has been used in previous studies to train diffusion models.

2. **SKIRT TNG Dataset**: This dataset is a large public collection of images spanning 0.3-5 microns, created by applying dust radiative transfer post-processing to galaxies from the TNG cosmological simulations. It is noted for its unique opportunity to build prior knowledge about the morphology of faint galaxies.

In the **results section**, the authors validate their method using observations from the **COSMOS survey** and the **SMACS 0723 field**, which further confirms the datasets they utilized.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **PROBES Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Connor Stone and StÃ©phane Courteau. *The Intrinsic Scatter of the Radial Acceleration Relation*. The Astrophysical Journal, 882(1):6, September 2019. doi: 10.3847/1538-4357/ab3126.

- For the **SKIRT TNG Dataset**, the citation is:
  > P. Camps and M. Baes. *Skirt 9: Redesigning an advanced dust radiative transfer code to allow kinematics, line transfer and polarization by aligned dust grains*. Astronomy and Computing, 31:100381, 2020. doi: 10.1016/j.ascom.2020.100381.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately captured the necessary information for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will be crucial for any further processing or documentation of the datasets used in this research.
