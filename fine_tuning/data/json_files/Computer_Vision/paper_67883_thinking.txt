To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding Representations Pretrained with Auxiliary Losses for Embodied Agent Planning" by Yuxuan Li and Luca Weihs, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating representations on two goal-directed tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of pretrained visual representations and mention that they are using a fixed dataset of exploration trajectories. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.1 (Pretraining)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset used for pretraining. They mention the **EXPLOREHOUSE dataset**, which consists of high-quality exploration trajectories. The dataset comprises 9.5K houses generated using ProcTHOR, with approximately 10 episodes in each house. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **ProcTHOR dataset**, which is crucial for proper attribution. The citation for ProcTHOR is:
> Matt Deitke, Eli VanderBilt, Alvaro Herrasti, Luca Weihs, Kiana Ehsani, Jordi Salvador, Winson Han, Eric Kolve, Aniruddha Kembhavi, and Roozbeh Mottaghi. *Procthor: Large-scale embodied AI using procedural generation*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35, 2022.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

I will create an entry for the **EXPLOREHOUSE dataset** using the provided citation and description, ensuring that the citation is included for proper referencing. After this, I will finalize the dataset entry for review or further processing.
