To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Easy Guided Decoding in Providing Suggestions for Interactive Machine Translation" by Ke Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to the **WeTS1** and **WMT 2022 Translation Suggestion datasets**, indicating that these are key datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets, such as a dedicated **Datasets** or **Experiments** section. In the **Experiments** section, the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention that the **WeTS** dataset consists of samples with a source sentence, a masked machine translation sentence, and a golden reference for the masked span. They also reference the **WMT22-TS** dataset, which is similarly structured.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

1. **WeTS Dataset**:
   > Yang, Z., Meng, F., Zhang, Y., Li, E., & Zhou, J. (2021). *WeTS: A Benchmark for Translation Suggestion*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.05151.

2. **WMT 2022 Translation Suggestion Dataset**:
   > Yang, Z., Meng, F., Zhang, Y., Li, E., & Zhou, J. (2022). *Findings of the WMT 2022 Shared Task on Translation Suggestion*. In Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Machine Translation, pages 821â€“829, Abu Dhabi. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **WeTS Dataset**: A benchmark dataset for translation suggestion tasks, containing pairs of source sentences and masked translations with human-annotated references for the masked spans.

2. **WMT 2022 Translation Suggestion Dataset**: A dataset used in the WMT 2022 shared task, structured similarly to WeTS, focusing on translation suggestions.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
