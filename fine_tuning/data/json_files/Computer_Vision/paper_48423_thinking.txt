To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Short-Term Stock Price-Trend Prediction Using Meta-Learning" by Shin-Hung Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the study evaluates a meta-learning framework applied to stock price predictions, specifically mentioning the **S&P500** as the dataset used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **methodology section**. The authors mention that they selected their dataset from among various component stocks of the **S&P500**, which consists of well-established firms in the United States. This suggests that the dataset is derived from historical stock price data of these companies.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their models based on the S&P500 dataset, confirming its use in their experiments. However, they do not provide additional datasets or variations, focusing solely on the S&P500 for their analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the S&P500 dataset. While the paper does not provide a specific citation for the S&P500 index itself, it is commonly referenced in financial literature. Therefore, I will use a standard citation format for the S&P500 index:

- **S&P500 Index**: 
  > Standard & Poor's. *S&P 500 Index*. Available at: https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-500/

Since the paper primarily focuses on the S&P500 dataset without mentioning any other datasets, I will document this single dataset entry.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that the citation is complete and accurate for future reference.
