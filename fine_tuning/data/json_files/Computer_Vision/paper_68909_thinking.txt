To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comprehensive View of the Biases of Toxicity and Sentiment Analysis Methods Towards Utterances with African American English Expressions" by Guilherme H. Resende et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets section** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors analyze biases in toxicity and sentiment analysis methods using various datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets and Pre-Processing)**, where the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in their analysis. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **Twitter AAE Dataset**: This dataset consists of tweets classified as African American English (AAE) or Mainstream American English (MAE). It includes a subset of tweets where the model predicted over 80% probability for each class.

2. **YouTube Dataset**: This dataset comprises subtitles extracted from YouTube movie reviews featuring a single speaker discussing a unique topic per video. The authors aimed to control for confounding variables by focusing on acclaimed films.

3. **CORAAL Dataset**: The Corpus of Regional African American Language (CORAAL) includes socio-linguistic interviews with African American English speakers. It provides transcriptions of interviews along with demographic information.

4. **Buckeye Dataset**: This dataset focuses on Caucasian speakers from central Ohio and includes transcriptions of conversational speech.

In the datasets section, the authors provide statistics about each dataset, including the number of documents, sentences, and AAE expressions present. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope and relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Twitter AAE Dataset**:

- For the **YouTube Dataset**:
  > The dataset description is not attributed to a specific paper but is based on the authors' manual collection efforts from YouTube.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the key details and citations for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included for reference.
