To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Link Representation Learning for Probabilistic Travel Time Estimation" by Chen Xu, Qiang Wang, and Lijun Sun, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets used in the study.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if the authors mention any datasets. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their model on "two real-world GPS trajectory datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets in detail. In the **Experiments** section, the authors mention the two datasets used for evaluation: **Chengdu** and **Harbin**. I will note down the key characteristics of each dataset as described in the paper.

1. **Chengdu Dataset**: This dataset consists of 3,186 links and 346,074 samples spanning 6 days. The travel times range from 420 to 2880 seconds, with a mean of 786 seconds.

2. **Harbin Dataset**: This dataset includes 8,497 links and 1,268,139 samples, also spanning 6 days. The travel times range from 420 to 2994 seconds, with a mean of 912 seconds.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets, as they are likely publicly available datasets from taxi or ride-hailing services. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are publicly available but do not have specific citations provided in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the findings for each dataset, ensuring to include the relevant details such as the number of links, samples, and travel time statistics.

After compiling this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
