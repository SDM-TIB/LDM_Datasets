To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Laughing Matters: Introducing Laughing-Face Generation Using Diffusion Models" by Antoni Bigata Casademunt et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their model on a "diverse set of laughter datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention four datasets suitable for laughter generation: **MAHNOB**, **AVLaughterCycle**, **AVIC**, and **SAL**. Each dataset is described in terms of the number of speakers, videos, average length, and total length, which provides essential details for each dataset.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The relevant citations are:

- For **MAHNOB**:
  > Stavros Petridis, Brais Martinez, and Maja Pantic. *The MAHNOB Laughter Database*. Image and Vision Computing, 31(2):186–202, 2013.

- For **AVLaughterCycle**:
  > Jérôme Urbain, Elisabetta Bevacqua, Thierry Dutoit, Alexis Moinet, Radoslaw Niewiadomski, Catherine Pelachaud, Benjamin Picart, Joëlle Tilmanne, and Johannes Wagner. *The AVLaughterCycle Database*. In LREC, 2010.

- For **AVIC**:

- For **SAL**:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a clear and comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research.
