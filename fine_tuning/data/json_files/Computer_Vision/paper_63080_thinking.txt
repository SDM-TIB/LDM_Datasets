To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Recognition of Birds in Offshore Wind Farms Based on an Improved Deep Learning Model" by Yantong Liu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and data collection, and methods sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the method was tested on a publicly available dataset and a dataset obtained from the Xinwanjin offshore power plant, which indicates that there are at least two datasets involved.

In the **introduction**, the focus is primarily on the challenges of defect detection in offshore wind turbines, but it does not provide specific dataset names. Therefore, I will move on to the **materials and data collection section**.

In **section 2.1 (Experimental Data)**, the author states that images were collected from the Saemangeum offshore wind farm and a publicly available dataset of offshore wind turbines. The total number of images collected is 5,432, with 5,000 images selected for the study. This section provides crucial information about the datasets used, but I need to find the exact names and citations for the publicly available dataset.

Next, I will check the **references section** to identify any papers that might describe the publicly available dataset. The references do not explicitly mention the dataset name, but I will look for papers that are likely to be related to the dataset used for offshore wind turbine inspections.

After reviewing the references, I find that the following citations may be relevant:

1. **Saemangeum Offshore Wind Farm Dataset**: This dataset is specific to the Saemangeum offshore wind farm in South Korea, but it does not have a formal citation since it is likely a proprietary dataset collected by the author.

2. **Publicly Available Dataset**: The paper does not specify the name of the publicly available dataset, but I will note that it is used for offshore wind turbine inspections. I will need to indicate that the exact citation is not provided in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring to include the citations where possible. Since the Saemangeum dataset does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Dataset 1**: Saemangeum Offshore Wind Farm Dataset (proprietary, no citation available)
- **Dataset 2**: Publicly Available Offshore Wind Turbine Dataset (exact name and citation not provided)

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
