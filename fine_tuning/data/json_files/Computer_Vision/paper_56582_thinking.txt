To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Are Neural Topic Models Broken?" by Pranav Goel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors analyze two English-language datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention two datasets:

1. **Wikipedia Dataset**: This dataset consists of 14,000 "good" articles from Wikipedia. It has 45 labeled high-level and 279 low-level labels, which serve as ground truth for evaluating the quality of document-topic posteriors.

2. **Bills Dataset**: This dataset includes 32,000 bill summaries from the 110-114th U.S. Congresses. Similar to the Wikipedia dataset, it has hierarchical labels with 21 high-level and 114 low-level labels.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about how these datasets were processed and utilized in their evaluations, confirming their significance in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are commonly used and well-known, they may not have specific citations in the references. Instead, I will note their origins:

- For the **Wikipedia Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Merity, S., Xiong, C., Bradbury, J., & Socher, R. (2017). Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

- For the **Bills Dataset**, the authors mention that the raw bill data was extracted from:
  > GovTrack.us. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.govtrack.us/data/us/

With this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring to include the full citations as required.

After compiling the dataset entries, I will prepare them for any further processing or review.
