To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FTBNN: Rethinking Non-Linearity for 1-Bit CNNs and Going Beyond" by Zhuo Su et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed model on the **ImageNet dataset**, which is a significant clue that a dataset is being used.

Next, I will examine the **methods** and **experiments** sections, particularly looking for any explicit mentions of datasets. In the introduction, the authors reference the **MNIST dataset** for experiments related to their proposed model. This indicates that both ImageNet and MNIST are datasets of interest.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they used the **ImageNet dataset** for their primary evaluations and also mention the **MNIST dataset** for specific experiments. This reinforces the importance of these datasets in their research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **ImageNet dataset**, the citation is:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 248â€“255. IEEE, 2009.

2. For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
   > Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. 2010. URL http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset used for image classification tasks, containing millions of labeled images across thousands of categories.
- **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits, commonly used for training various image processing systems.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
