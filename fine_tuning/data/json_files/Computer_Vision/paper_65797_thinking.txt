To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Text Augmented Spatial-aware Zero-shot Referring Image Segmentation" by Yucheng Suo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on various datasets, specifically naming **RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg**. This is a strong indication that these datasets are central to the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Dataset and Metrics)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they confirm that the experiments were conducted on the **RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg** datasets, which are widely used for referring image segmentation tasks. The authors also mention that all images in these datasets come from the **MSCOCO dataset** and are labeled with referring expressions.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **RefCOCO**:
   > Yu, L., Poirson, P., Yang, S., Berg, A. C., & Berg, T. L. (2016). Modeling context in referring expressions. In *Computer Vision–ECCV 2016: 14th European Conference, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, October 11-14, 2016, Proceedings, Part II 14* (pp. 69-85). Springer.

2. **RefCOCO+**:
   > Yu, L., Poirson, P., Yang, S., Berg, A. C., & Berg, T. L. (2016). Modeling context in referring expressions. In *Computer Vision–ECCV 2016: 14th European Conference, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, October 11-14, 2016, Proceedings, Part II 14* (pp. 69-85). Springer. (Note: RefCOCO+ is an extension of RefCOCO, so it shares the same citation.)

3. **RefCOCOg**:
   > Yu, L., Poirson, P., Yang, S., Berg, A. C., & Berg, T. L. (2016). Modeling context in referring expressions. In *Computer Vision–ECCV 2016: 14th European Conference, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, October 11-14, 2016, Proceedings, Part II 14* (pp. 69-85). Springer. (Similar to RefCOCO and RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg is also based on the same foundational work.)

After confirming the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
