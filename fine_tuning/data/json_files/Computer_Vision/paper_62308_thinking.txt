To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "A Badminton Recognition and Tracking System Based on Context Multi-feature Fusion" by Xinyu Wang and Jianwei Li, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but the details about datasets are likely found in the experimental evaluation section.

In **section 3 (Experimental Evaluation)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Coach AI dataset**: This dataset contains video clips of 75 high-ranking badminton matches from 2018 to 2021, played by 31 players. It is used for tracking tests.

2. **Badminton classification dataset**: This dataset is used for object classification in the two-stage detection algorithm. It includes 3000 targets randomly selected from the training set and divided into 18 categories.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Coach AI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, W.-Y., Shuai, H.-H., Chang, K.-S., & Peng, W.-C. (2022). Shuttlenet: Position-aware fusion of rally progress and player styles for stroke forecasting in badminton. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 36, 4219â€“4227.

- For the **Badminton classification dataset**, since it is mentioned as part of the methodology without a specific citation, I will note that it is derived from the Coach AI dataset and does not have a separate citation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations. The entries will include the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that all information is accurately represented.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that they are ready for review or further processing.
