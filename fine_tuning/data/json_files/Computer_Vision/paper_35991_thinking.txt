To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Working hard to know your neighbor’s margins: Local descriptor learning loss" by Anastasiya Mishchuk et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they focus on descriptor learning and utilize standard patch correspondence data for training. This suggests that there are specific datasets involved, but I need to locate their names and details.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** for explicit mentions of datasets. In section 3.3, the authors refer to the **UBC Phototour dataset**, which consists of three subsets: Liberty, Notre Dame, and Yosemite, containing approximately 400k normalized 64x64 patches. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, as they mention using it for training and testing.

Additionally, in section 4.1, the authors discuss the **HPatches dataset**, which is used for local patch descriptor evaluation. This dataset consists of 116 sequences of images with significant viewpoint and illumination changes, making it relevant for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **UBC Phototour dataset**, the citation is:
   > Matthew Brown and David G. Lowe. *Automatic panoramic image stitching using invariant features*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 74(1):59–73, 2007.

2. For the **HPatches dataset**, the citation is:
   > Vassileios Balntas, Karel Lenc, Andrea Vedaldi, and Krystian Mikolajczyk. *HPatches: A benchmark and evaluation of handcrafted and learned local descriptors*. In Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the paper.
