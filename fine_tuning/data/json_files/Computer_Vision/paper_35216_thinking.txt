To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Capturing Variabilities from Computed Tomography Images with Generative Adversarial Networks" by Umair Javaid and John A. Lee, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a method for generating 2D CT images, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of data scarcity in medical imaging and mention the use of data augmentation techniques. They specifically refer to a dataset in the context of their study, which is a good indication that I should look for its details.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset they examined: the **Lung CT images dataset** from the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC). They provide details about the dataset, stating that it consists of 267 Lung CT scans with dimensions of 512 × 512 pixels.

To ensure I have the correct citation for this dataset, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citation for the LIDC dataset is as follows:
> S. G. Armato III et al. *Lung image database consortium: developing a resource for the medical imaging research community*. Radiology, 232(3):739–748, 2004.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Lung CT images dataset**: This dataset consists of 267 Lung CT scans, each with dimensions of 512 × 512 pixels. It is publicly available through the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC).

With this information, I can now prepare to compile the dataset entry in the required format for further processing or review.
