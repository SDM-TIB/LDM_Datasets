To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Is CLIP the main roadblock for fine-grained open-world perception?" by Lorenzo Bianchi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and describe the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the evaluation of CLIP against a fine-grained object-matching benchmark, which suggests that there may be specific datasets used for this evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **method section**, particularly the part where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using the **Fine-Grained Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (FG-OVD)** benchmark suite, which is crucial for understanding their evaluation process. I will look for details about this dataset, including its structure and purpose.

In the **experiments section**, the authors refer to the **MS-COCO dataset** as the dataset used for the warm-up phase of their model training. This dataset is well-known for image-text pairings and is essential for their evaluation of coarse-grained capabilities.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

The citations I will extract are:

1. For the **Fine-Grained Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (FG-OVD)** benchmark:
   > Lorenzo Bianchi, Fabio Carrara, Nicola Messina, Claudio Gennaro, and Fabrizio Falchi. *The devil is in the fine-grained details: Evaluating open-vocabulary object detectors for fine-grained understanding*. In [Accepted for publication in CVPR 2024], 2024.

2. For the **MS-COCO dataset**:
   > Andrej Karpathy and Li Fei-Fei. *Deep visual-semantic alignments for generating image descriptions*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 3128â€“3137, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and that the full citations are included for reference. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets mentioned in the paper.
