To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cost-Sensitive Convolution based Neural Networks for Imbalanced Time-Series Classification" by Yue Geng and Xinyu Luo, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method was evaluated on a "large volume, real-life and imbalanced time-series dataset," which indicates that a specific dataset is used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the dataset used for validation. In this section, they specify that the dataset comes from the "AAIA16 Data Mining Challenge: Predicting Dangerous Seismic Events in Active Coal Mines." This is a clear indication of the dataset's name and context.

I will then look for detailed descriptions of the dataset, including its attributes, number of samples, and class distribution. The authors provide specific information about the dataset, stating that it contains 133,151 samples in the training set, with 541 attributes, and an imbalanced class distribution of 130,188 normal samples and 2,963 warning samples.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The dataset is associated with a specific challenge, so I will cite it accordingly. The citation for the dataset is:

> Janusz, A., et al. "Predicting seismic events in coal mines based on underground sensor measurements." *Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence*, 2017. 64: p. 83-94.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and the full citation in a structured format.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entry for further processing or review.
