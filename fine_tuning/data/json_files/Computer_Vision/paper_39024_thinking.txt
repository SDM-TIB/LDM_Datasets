To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Attacks Hidden in Plain Sight" by Jan Philip Göpfert et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a user study on classifying adversarially modified images, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in this study.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they discuss adversarial examples and their implications but do not explicitly name any datasets.

Moving on to the **methodology section**, I will look for details about the user study. The authors state that they randomly selected 20 labels and 4 samples per label from the validation set of the **ILSVRC 2012 classification challenge**. This indicates that the ILSVRC 2012 dataset is used in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, they confirm that they generated adversarial examples using images from the ILSVRC 2012 dataset. This reinforces the identification of the dataset used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ILSVRC 2012 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Olga Russakovsky et al. "ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge". In: International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV) 115.3 (2015), pp. 211–252. doi: 10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the ILSVRC 2012 dataset for its experiments, I will create an entry for this dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that it includes the full citation, and prepare it for structured output as required.
