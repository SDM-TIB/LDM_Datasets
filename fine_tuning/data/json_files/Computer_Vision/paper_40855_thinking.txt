To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Masking Salient Object Detection, a Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network Analysis for Segmentation of Salient Objects" by Bruno A. Krinski et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors compare different neural network architectures in the context of Salient Object Detection (SOD), which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for training and testing their models. They mention that they trained their models on the **MSRA10K dataset** and tested on **eight public datasets** widely used in the SOD literature. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **DUT-OMRON**: A large dataset with 5,168 natural images containing one or more salient objects.
2. **ECSSD**: Contains 1,000 images with a variety of scenarios and complex backgrounds.
3. **HKU-IS**: Comprises 4,447 challenging images with low contrast or multiple foreground objects.
4. **ICOSEG**: An interactive co-segmentation dataset with 643 images featuring single or multiple salient objects.
5. **PASCAL-S**: Contains 850 natural images with multiple complex objects and cluttered backgrounds, derived from the PASCAL VOC 2012 segmentation challenge.
6. **SED1**: A smaller dataset with only 100 images.
7. **SED2**: Another small dataset, also containing 100 images.
8. **THUR**: Contains 6,232 images and is unique in being divided into classes.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its corresponding citation.
