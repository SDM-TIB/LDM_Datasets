To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ATD: Augmenting CP Tensor Decomposition by Self Supervision" by Chaoqi Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method is evaluated on multiple datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be found.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically provide details about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention four datasets:

1. **Sleep-EDF Dataset**: This dataset contains EOG, EMG, and EEG polysomnography recordings. The paper indicates that it is used for sleep staging tasks.

2. **Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Dataset**: This dataset consists of smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope data, used for activity recognition tasks.

3. **PTB-XL Dataset**: This dataset includes 12-lead ECG signals and is used for gender identification tasks.

4. **Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Dataset**: This dataset contains multi-channel EEG waves and is also used for sleep staging tasks.

I will now check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Sleep-EDF Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kemp, B., Zwinderman, A. H., Tuk, B., Kamphuisen, H. A., & Oberye, J. J. (2000). Analysis of a sleep-dependent neuronal feedback loop: the slow-wave microcontinuity of the EEG. *IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering*, 47(9), 1185-1194.

- For the **HAR Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **PTB-XL Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alday, E. A. P., Gu, A., Shah, A. J., Robichaux, C., Wong, A.-K. I., Liu, C., Liu, F., Rad, A. B., Elola, A., Seyedi, S., et al. (2020). Classification of 12-lead ECGs: the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2020. *Physiological Measurement*, 41(12), 124003.

- For the **MGH Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Biswal, S., Sun, H., Goparaju, B., Westover, M. B., Sun, J., & Bianchi, M. T. (2018). Expert-level sleep scoring with deep neural networks. *Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association*, 25(12), 1643-1650.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
