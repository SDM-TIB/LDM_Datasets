To extract datasets from the research paper titled "One-Pixel Shortcut: On the Learning Preference of Deep Neural Networks" by Shutong Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new dataset called **CIFAR-10-S**, which is a key dataset for this paper. This indicates that there may be additional datasets referenced throughout the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments** section, particularly looking for any specific mentions of datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors discuss their evaluation on **CIFAR-10** and **ImageNet** subsets, which are crucial datasets in the context of their research.

I will also check the **related work** section to see if any other datasets are referenced that may have been used in prior studies or comparisons. The authors mention datasets like **ImageNet-A** and **ObjectNet**, which are relevant to the discussion of shortcut learning and adversarial examples.

After identifying the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

Here are the datasets I will extract:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset is widely used in machine learning for image classification tasks. The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

2. **CIFAR-10-S**: This is the new dataset introduced in the paper, which is crafted to evaluate the model's resistance to shortcuts. The citation is:
   > Shutong Wu, Sizhe Chen, Cihang Xie, and Xiaolin Huang. *One-Pixel Shortcut: On the Learning Preference of Deep Neural Networks*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2023.

3. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset for image classification. The citation is:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211–252, 2015.

4. **ImageNet-A**: A dataset used to evaluate the robustness of models against adversarial examples. The citation is:
   > Dan Hendrycks, Kevin Zhao, Steven Basart, Jacob Steinhardt, and Dawn Song. *Natural Adversarial Examples*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 15262–15271, 2021.

5. **ObjectNet**: Another dataset referenced in the context of shortcut learning. The citation is:
   > Andrei Barbu, David Mayo, Julian Alverio, William Luo, Christopher Wang, Dan Gutfreund, Josh Tenenbaum, and Boris Katz. *ObjectNet: A Large-Scale Bias-Controlled Dataset for Pushing the Limits of Object Recognition Models*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 32, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
