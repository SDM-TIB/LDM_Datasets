To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Head-Neck Dual-Energy CT Contrast Media Reduction Using Diffusion Models" by Qing Lyu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's purpose and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of iodinated contrast media in dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) and the challenges associated with its use. This section may not explicitly mention datasets but sets the context for the research.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically **section 2 (Data Acquisition)**, where the authors describe the data collection process. Here, they mention using a total of **110 DECT scans** collected from the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center. They specify that these scans were performed on Siemens Somatom Drive CT scanners and detail the contrast media used, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

The authors indicate that the scans were divided into three groups: **80 scans for training, 20 scans for testing, and 10 scans for a reader study**. This breakdown is essential for understanding how the dataset was utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset mentioned in the paper. The authors do not provide a formal citation for the dataset in the references section, but I can infer that the dataset is derived from clinical data collected at a specific medical center. Therefore, I will create a citation that reflects this source:

- **Dataset**: DECT scans from Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center
  - **Citation**: Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center. *DECT Scans for Contrast Media Reduction Study*. Collected in May and June 2022.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
