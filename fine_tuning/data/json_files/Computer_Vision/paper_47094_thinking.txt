To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Controllable and Diverse Text Generation in E-commerce" by Huajie Shao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Evaluation)**, as it is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for experiments. In this section, the authors mention that they collected a real-world dataset of item descriptions and keywords from the Chinese E-commerce platform, Taobao. This is a significant finding, as it indicates the primary dataset used in their research.

In **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors provide specific details about the dataset:
- The dataset contains **617,181 items** and **927,670 item text descriptions**. Each item description is written by multiple human writers, and the average number of descriptions per item is about **1.4**. The average number of words in each description is **61.3**, and there are approximately **14.75 keywords** per item on average. The total vocabulary size is **88,156**.

Since the dataset is derived from Taobao, I will need to find the appropriate citation for this dataset. The authors mention that the sampled data is publicly available at a GitHub repository, which is a crucial piece of information for citation purposes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there is a specific citation for the Taobao dataset or if I need to cite the GitHub repository directly. The relevant citation for the dataset is:
> Huajie Shao, Jun Wang, Haohong Lin, Xuezhou Zhang, Aston Zhang, Heng Ji, and Tarek Abdelzaher. 2021. *Controllable and Diverse Text Generation in E-commerce*. In Proceedings of the Web Conference 2021 (WWW ’21), April 19–23, 2021, Ljubljana, Slovenia. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 10 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3442381.3449838

Additionally, I will note the GitHub link provided in the paper for the dataset:
> The sampled data is publicly available at [https://github.com/paper-data-open/Text-Gen-Ecommerce](https://github.com/paper-data-open/Text-Gen-Ecommerce).

With this information, I can now compile the dataset details and citations into the required format for further processing. I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included for proper attribution.
