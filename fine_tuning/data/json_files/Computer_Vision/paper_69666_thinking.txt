To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hysteresis Compensation of Flexible Continuum Manipulator using RGBD Sensing and Temporal Convolutional Network" by Junhyun Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected data using customized fiducial markers and RGBD sensing, which suggests that a dataset was created for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the part where the authors describe the dataset collection process. In this section, they mention that they created a dataset comprising **30,707 command joint configurations (qcmd)** and their corresponding **physical joint configurations (qphy)**. This is a clear indication of a dataset that is central to their research.

I will also look for any specific details about the dataset, such as how it was constructed, the types of data included, and any relevant statistics. The authors state that the dataset was created by randomly selecting joint configurations within limits and that the physical configurations were captured using fiducial markers and RGBD sensing.

Now, I will check the **results section** to see if the dataset is referenced again, which may provide additional context or validation of its use in experiments. The authors discuss the performance of their models based on this dataset, confirming its importance in their research.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is created by the authors themselves and does not reference an external source, I will note that the dataset is original to this study.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Custom Dataset for Hysteresis Compensation
   - **Description**: The dataset consists of 30,707 pairs of command joint configurations (qcmd) and their corresponding physical joint configurations (qphy), collected using RGBD sensing and fiducial markers.
   - **Citation**: Junhyun Park, Seonghyeok Jang, Hyojae Park, Seongjun Bae, and Minho Hwang. *Hysteresis Compensation of Flexible Continuum Manipulator using RGBD Sensing and Temporal Convolutional Network*. 

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry in the required format for further processing or review.
