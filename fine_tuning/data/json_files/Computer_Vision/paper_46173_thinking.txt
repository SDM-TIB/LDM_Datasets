To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proactive Pseudo-Intervention: Contrastive Learning For Interpretable Vision Models" by Dong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions benchmarking on both standard natural images and challenging medical image datasets, indicating that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any subsection that discusses datasets. In this case, the authors explicitly list five datasets used for their experiments:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
2. **ImageNet (ILSVRC2012)**: A large-scale dataset for image classification, containing over 1.2 million images across 1,000 categories.
3. **CUB (Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011)**: A dataset with over 12,000 images for the classification of 200 bird species, heavily confounded by background characteristics.
4. **GA (Geographic Atrophy)**: A new medical image dataset for predicting geographic atrophy using 3D optical coherence tomography (OCT) image volumes, consisting of 275 subjects.
5. **LIDC-IDRI**: A public medical dataset containing 1,085 lung lesion CT images annotated by four radiologists.

I will then verify the details of each dataset mentioned in the **experiments section** to ensure accuracy. The authors provide specific characteristics of each dataset, which I will summarize.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Medical physics, 38(2):915–931, 2011.

With this information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
