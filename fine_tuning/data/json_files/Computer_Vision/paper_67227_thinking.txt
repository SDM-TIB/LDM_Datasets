To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Sign Actors: A diffusion model for 3D sign language production from text" by Vasileios Baltatzis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a diffusion-based model trained on a curated large-scale dataset of 4D signing avatars and their corresponding text transcripts. This suggests that a specific dataset is being utilized, which I need to identify.

Next, I will look into the **related work** section, particularly focusing on any references to existing datasets used in sign language research. The authors mention several datasets, including the **How2Sign dataset**, which is highlighted as a large-scale dataset of American Sign Language (ASL) with over 16,000 signs.

In the **method** section, the authors describe their dataset in detail. They mention that they curate a large-scale dataset of 3D dynamic ASL sign sequences paired with text transcripts, specifically extending the **How2Sign dataset**. They state that this dataset is composed of 35,000 high-resolution clips of co-articulated ASL, which is crucial for their experiments.

I will also check the **experiments** section to confirm that the **How2Sign dataset** is indeed the primary dataset used for training and evaluation. The authors emphasize the importance of this dataset for their proposed method.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The citation for the **How2Sign dataset** is as follows:
- Amanda Duarte, Shruti Palaskar, Lucas Ventura, Deepti Ghadiyaram, Kenneth DeHaan, Florian Metze, Jordi Torres, and Xavier Giro-i Nieto. *How2Sign: A large-scale multi-modal dataset for continuous American Sign Language*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 2735–2744, 2021.

Since the authors also refer to the **SMPL-X model** for pose annotations, I will include its citation as well, as it is integral to the dataset's structure:
- Georgios Pavlakos, Vasileios Choutas, Nima Ghorbani, Timo Bolkart, Ahmed AA Osman, Dimitrios Tzionas, and Michael J. Black. *Expressive body capture: 3D hands, face, and body from a single image*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 10975–10985, 2019.

After compiling this information, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
