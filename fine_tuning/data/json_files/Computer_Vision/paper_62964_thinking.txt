To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Character Time-series Matching For Robust License Plate Recognition" by Quang Huy Che et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves high performance on the **UFPR-ALPR dataset**, indicating that this dataset is crucial for the evaluation of their approach.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** section. The authors explicitly state that they evaluate their system on the **UFPR-ALPR dataset** and also mention a private dataset collected from multiple IP cameras on the streets of Vietnam. This suggests that both datasets are important for their research.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the **UFPR-ALPR dataset**, emphasizing its complexity and relevance for ALPR systems. They also mention that they gathered and labeled a private dataset consisting of 9,887 Vietnamese license plate images, which further supports their findings.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **UFPR-ALPR dataset**, the citation is:
   > R. Laroca, L. A. Zanlorensi, G. R. Gon√ßalves, E. Todt, W. R. Schwartz, and D. Menotti. *An efficient and layout-independent automatic license plate recognition system based on the YOLO detector*. CoRR, vol. abs/1909.01754, 2019. Available: http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01754

2. For the **private dataset** collected from Vietnamese streets, since it is not a publicly available dataset, I will note that it is a custom dataset created by the authors and does not have a formal citation.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **UFPR-ALPR dataset**: A public dataset used for evaluating automatic license plate recognition systems, known for its complexity and variety of conditions.
- **Vietnamese License Plate Dataset**: A private dataset collected by the authors, consisting of 9,887 images of Vietnamese license plates.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or analysis.
