To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Advanced Feature Learning on Point Clouds using Multi-resolution Features and Learnable Pooling" by Kevin Tirta Wijaya et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method, PointStack, outperforms existing networks on two popular tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment and Discussion)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **ModelNet40**: This dataset is described as a synthetic dataset containing 12,311 point clouds across 40 different shape categories. It is used for the shape classification task.

2. **ScanObjectNN**: This dataset consists of point clouds obtained from real-world object scans, containing around 15,000 point clouds across 15 different shape categories. It is used for both shape classification and part segmentation tasks.

3. **ShapeNetPart**: This dataset is derived from the ShapeNet dataset and contains 16,881 pre-aligned point cloud shapes categorized into 16 shape classes and a total of 50 segmentation classes. It is specifically used for the part segmentation task.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **ModelNet40**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Z., et al. (2015). *3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1912–1920.

- For **ScanObjectNN**, the citation is:
  > Uy, M. A., et al. (2019). *Revisiting Point Cloud Classification: A New Benchmark Dataset and Classification Model on Real-World Data*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 1588–1597.

- For **ShapeNetPart**, the citation is:
  > Yi, K., et al. (2016). *A Scalable Active Framework for Region Annotation in 3D Shape Collections*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (ToG), 35(6):1–12.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
