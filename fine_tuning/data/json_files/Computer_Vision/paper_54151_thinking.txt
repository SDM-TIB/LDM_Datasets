To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Frequency-Centroid Features for Word Recognition of Non-Native English Speakers" by Pierre Berjon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of automatic speech recognition (ASR) for non-native speakers and mention the need for datasets that include various accents. This suggests that datasets are crucial for their experiments, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors describe their methodology. They mention utilizing a subset of the **Speech Accent Archive database**, which consists of speakers from 177 countries with 214 different mother tongues. This is a key dataset for their research.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **results section** or **conclusion** that may not have been highlighted earlier. However, the primary dataset appears to be the Speech Accent Archive.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the **Speech Accent Archive** dataset from the references section. The citation is as follows:
> "Speech Accent Archive." George Mason University. [Online]. Available: https://accent.gmu.edu/index.php

Since the authors did not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the Speech Accent Archive is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Speech Accent Archive in the final output.
