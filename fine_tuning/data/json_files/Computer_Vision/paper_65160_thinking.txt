To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Progressive Neural Compression for Adaptive Image Offloading under Timing Constraints" by Ruiqi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the use of image classification as the target application, which suggests that datasets related to image classification might be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets used for testing the proposed method. In the introduction, the authors mention that they demonstrate the benefits of their method on a testbed comprising an IoT device and an edge server, but I need to find specific datasets.

Upon reviewing the **implementation and evaluation sections**, I find that the authors mention using the **ImageNet dataset** for training and evaluation. They specify that they used 35,000 images for training, 5,000 for validation, and 2,000 for testing. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the ImageNet dataset in the **References section**. The citation for the ImageNet dataset is as follows:
> J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L. Li, K. Li, and F. Li. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255, 2009.

Additionally, I will check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. However, the primary focus appears to be on the ImageNet dataset for the experiments.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the ImageNet dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read through the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections to identify potential datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments and evaluation sections to confirm the datasets used.
3. Locate the full citation for the identified dataset in the references.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the ImageNet dataset based on the information collected.
