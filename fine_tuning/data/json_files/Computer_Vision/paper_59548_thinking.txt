To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Training Deep Boltzmann Networks with Sparse Ising Machines" by Shaila Niazi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention using the **full MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets** as well as a **reduced version of the CIFAR-10 dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are central to their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **methods and results sections**. In the results section, the authors provide a detailed description of the **MNIST dataset**, stating it consists of **60,000 training images and 10,000 test images**, each with dimensions of **28x28 pixels**. They also mention that the **Fashion MNIST dataset** consists of **70,000 grayscale images** of fashion products, with **60,000 for training** and **10,000 for testing**.

In the methods section, the authors describe how they used the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, which consists of **32x32 color images** across **10 different classes**. They clarify that they used a **reduced version** of this dataset for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
   > Yann LeCun. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ (1998).

2. For the **Fashion MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
   > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: a novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747 (2017).

3. For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html (2009).

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary information is included for each dataset.
