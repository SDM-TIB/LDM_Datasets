To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLIPA-v2: Scaling CLIP Training with 81.1% Zero-shot ImageNet Accuracy within a $10,000 Budget" by Xianhang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the achievement of a zero-shot ImageNet accuracy of 81.1% and mentions the use of datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors discuss their methodology and the datasets used. In this section, they mention two key datasets:

1. **LAION-400M**: This dataset is referenced multiple times throughout the paper, particularly in the context of training and performance evaluation. It is noted for its large scale and is crucial for the experiments conducted.

2. **LAION-2B**: This dataset is also mentioned as a source for training, and the authors indicate that switching from LAION-400M to LAION-2B yields performance improvements.

Additionally, the authors refer to **DataComp-1B**, which is another dataset used in their experiments. They emphasize the importance of data diversity and the impact of dataset choice on model performance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **LAION-400M**, the citation is:
  > Christoph Schuhmann, Richard Vencu, Romain Beaumont, Robert Kaczmarczyk, Clayton Mullis, Aarush Katta, Theo Coombes, Jenia Jitsev, and Aran Komatsuzaki. *LAION-400M: Open dataset of CLIP-filtered 400 million image-text pairs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.02114, 2021.

- For **LAION-2B**, the citation is:

- For **DataComp-1B**, the citation is:
  > Samir Yitzhak Gadre, Gabriel Ilharco, Alex Fang, Jonathan Hayase, Georgios Smyrnis, Thao Nguyen, Ryan Marten, Mitchell Wortsman, Dhruba Ghosh, Jieyu Zhang, et al. *Datacomp: In search of the next generation of multimodal datasets*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.14108, 2023.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
