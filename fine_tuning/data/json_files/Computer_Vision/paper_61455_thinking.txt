To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LowDINO - A Low Parameter Self Supervised Learning Model" by Sai Krishna Prathapaneni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the model is trained on the **ImageNet1k dataset**, which is a significant dataset in the field of computer vision. The introduction also mentions **CIFAR100** and **ImageNet1k**, confirming their relevance to the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors specifically mention using **CIFAR100** and **ImageNet1k** for their experiments, which provides clarity on the datasets utilized.

Now, I will gather detailed information about each dataset:

1. **ImageNet1k**: This dataset is widely used for image classification tasks and contains over a million images categorized into 1,000 classes. It is a benchmark dataset for evaluating the performance of various models in computer vision.

2. **CIFAR100**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 100 classes, with 600 images per class. It is commonly used for training machine learning models in image classification tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet1k**, the citation is:
  > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., Berg, A. C., & Fei-Fei, L. (2015). ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge. *International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV)*, 115(3), 211–252.

- For **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images. *Technical Report*, 1–60.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the study.
