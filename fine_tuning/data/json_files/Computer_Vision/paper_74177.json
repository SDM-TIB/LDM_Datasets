Each pixel features a spatial resolution of 20 meters and spans 220 spectral bands within the wavelength range of 400 to 2500 nm. After excluding bands impacted by noise, 200 bands are retained for classification purposes. This dataset includes 10,249 labeled pixels distributed across 16 categories.",
