To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IGNITE: Individualized GeNeration of Imputations in Time-series Electronic health records" by Ghadeer O. Ghosheh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their model on "three large publicly available datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any section that discusses the datasets used. In this paper, the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets in **section F (Datasets)**. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **PhysioNet Challenge 2012**: This dataset is described as an open-access dataset for ICU patients with over 80% missingness. It includes 12,000 encounters and 35 time-series physiological data features.

2. **eICU**: A multi-center database for ICU data from over 208 hospitals in the United States, containing more than 200,000 admissions and 827 million observations. The dataset includes 55 time-series physiological data features.

3. **HiRID**: A single-center critical care dataset from the Bern University Hospital in Switzerland, containing admissions for over 33,000 patients. It includes 50 physiological time-series features.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **PhysioNet Challenge 2012**:
  > Silva, I., Moody, G., Scott, D. J., Celi, L. A., & Mark, R. G. (2012). Predicting in-hospital mortality of ICU patients: The PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2012. In 2012 Computing in Cardiology, pages 245–248. IEEE.

- For **eICU**:
  > Pollard, T. J., Johnson, A. E. W., Raffa, J. D., Celi, L. A., Mark, R. G., & Badawi, O. (2018). The eICU Collaborative Research Database, a freely available multi-center database for critical care research. Scientific Data, 5(1):1–13.

- For **HiRID**:
  > Li, J., Cairns, B. J., Li, J., & Zhu, T. (2023). Generating synthetic mixed-type longitudinal electronic health records for artificial intelligent applications. NPJ Digital Medicine, 6(1):98.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
