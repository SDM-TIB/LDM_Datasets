To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Clover: Regressive Lightweight Speculative Decoding with Sequential Knowledge" by Bin Xiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on the **Baichuan internal supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset** and evaluated performance on another internal Baichuan dataset consisting of various tasks. This indicates that there are datasets involved, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. They specifically mention:

1. **Baichuan internal supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset**: This dataset contains approximately 0.15 billion tokens, with 95% of the data being in Chinese. It is used to train both the Medusa and Clover models.

2. **Internal Baichuan dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating inference performance and consists of a variety of tasks, including retrieval augmentation (RA), multi-turn conversation (MC), code (Code), information process (IP), creation (CA), logical reasoning (RS), math (Math), tabular (Tab), question answering (QA), and medical suggestion (Med). Each of these tasks contains 100 dialogues.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets mentioned are internal and specific to the authors' work, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. In this case, I will note that the datasets are internal and provide a description instead.

1. **Baichuan internal supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset**: 
   - Description: Contains approximately 0.15 billion tokens, primarily in Chinese, used for training the models.

2. **Internal Baichuan dataset**:
   - Description: Comprises various tasks for evaluating model performance, including RA, MC, Code, IP, CA, RS, Math, Tab, QA, and Med, with 100 dialogues per task.

Since these datasets are not publicly available, I will indicate that they are internal datasets without formal citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that clearly outlines the datasets and their descriptions, ready for further processing or review.
