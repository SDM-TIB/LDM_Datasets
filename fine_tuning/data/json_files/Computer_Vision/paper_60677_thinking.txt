To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion Models for Time Series Applications" by Lequan Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on the introduction and subsequent sections for specific dataset details.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention various applications of diffusion models in time series forecasting, imputation, and generation. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point, so I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Time Series Forecasting)** and **section 4 (Time Series Imputation)**, as these sections are likely to contain specific datasets used for the experiments. In these sections, the authors discuss several models and their applications, which may reference datasets.

Upon reviewing these sections, I find that the authors mention specific datasets used in their experiments:

1. **METR-LA Dataset**: This dataset contains traffic speed data collected by 207 sensors on a Los Angeles highway over a four-month period. It is used for spatio-temporal graph forecasting.

2. **PEMS-BAY Dataset**: Similar to METR-LA, this dataset includes traffic data collected from various sensors in the Bay Area, also used for spatio-temporal forecasting tasks.

3. **UCI Machine Learning Repository**: The authors reference datasets from this repository for various time series forecasting tasks, although they do not specify which datasets are used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **METR-LA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li, Y., Yu, R., Shahabi, C., & P. Liu. (2018). Diffusion convolutional recurrent neural network: Data-driven traffic forecasting. *International Conference on Learning Representations*.

- For the **PEMS-BAY Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li, Y., Yu, R., Shahabi, C., & P. Liu. (2018). Diffusion convolutional recurrent neural network: Data-driven traffic forecasting. *International Conference on Learning Representations*.

- For the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**, the citation is:
  > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). UCI Machine Learning Repository. *University of California, Irvine, School of Information and Computer Sciences*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
