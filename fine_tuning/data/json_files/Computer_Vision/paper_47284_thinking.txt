To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A learning-based view extrapolation method for axial super-resolution" by Zhaolin Xiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the experimental results with both synthetic and real light fields, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention using multiple public datasets for both synthetic light fields and real light fields captured by Lytro cameras and microscopy datasets. This indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to identify.

I will look for specific names of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors mention using the **INRIA synthetic dense light field datasets**, which includes several specific scenes such as 'Ballon coucou', 'Bike dense', 'Big clock', 'Microphone', and 'Flying toys'. This gives me a clear list of datasets to document.

Additionally, they refer to datasets from **HCI**, **EPFL**, and **Stanford microscopy datasets**. I will need to ensure I capture the full citations for these datasets as well.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **INRIA synthetic dense light field datasets**:
   > X. Jiang, M. Le Pendu, R. A. Farrugia, and C. Guillemot. "Light field compression with homography-based low-rank approximation." *IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing*, vol. 11, no. 7, pp. 1132–1145, 2017.

2. **HCI dataset**:
   > S. Wanner, S. Meister, and B. Goldluecke. "Datasets and benchmarks for densely sampled 4D light fields." In *Vision, Modeling - Visualization*. The Eurographics Association, 2013.

3. **EPFL dataset**:
   > M. Rerabek and T. Ebrahimi. "New light field image dataset." In *8th International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX)*, 2016.

4. **Stanford microscopy datasets**:
   > M. Levoy, R. Ng, A. Adams, M. Footer, and M. Horowitz. "Light field microscopy." *ACM TOG*, vol. 25, no. 3, pp. 924–934, 2006.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
