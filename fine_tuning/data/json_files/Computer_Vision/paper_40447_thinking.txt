To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Guided Convolutional Network for Depth Completion" by Jie Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on various datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: The authors describe it as containing 86,898 frames for training, 1,000 frames for validation, and another 1,000 frames for testing. The ground truth depth is generated from LiDAR scans.

2. **Virtual KITTI Dataset**: This is a synthetic dataset created by cloning scenes from the real-world KITTI video sequences, containing 17,000 image frames under various conditions.

3. **NYUv2 Dataset**: This dataset consists of RGB images and depth images captured by Microsoft Kinect in 464 indoor scenes, with specific training and testing protocols outlined.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **KITTI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are We Ready for Autonomous Driving? The KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3354–3361, 2012.

- For the **Virtual KITTI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Gaidon, Q. Wang, Y. Cabon, and E. Vig. *Virtual Worlds as Proxy for Multi-Object Tracking Analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 4340–4349, 2016.

- For the **NYUv2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nathan Silberman, Derek Hoiem, Pushmeet Kohli, and Rob Fergus. *Indoor Segmentation and Support Inference from RGBD Images*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 746–760, 2012.

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
