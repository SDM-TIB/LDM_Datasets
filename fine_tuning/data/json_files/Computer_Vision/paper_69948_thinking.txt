To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Segment Anything Model for Head and Neck Tumor Segmentation with CT, PET and MRI Multi-Modality Images" by Jintao Ren et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for tumor segmentation, but I need to look for specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors highlight the challenges of delineating gross tumor volume (GTV) in head and neck cancer using multi-modality images. They mention the need for datasets but do not specify any yet.

Moving to the **materials and methods section**, the authors describe their dataset: they included **576 HNC patients** from Aarhus University Hospital who underwent treatment planning with FDG-PET/CT, T1-weighted, and T2-weighted MRI. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including the number of patients and the types of imaging modalities used.

Next, I will check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any additional insights or confirm the dataset's use in their experiments. They mention evaluating the performance of MedSAM on their local dataset, which reinforces the importance of the dataset described in the materials and methods.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is derived from a specific patient cohort treated at Aarhus University Hospital, I will cite it as follows:

- **Local HNC Dataset**: 
  > Jintao Ren, Mathis Rasmussen, Jasper Nijkamp, Jesper Grau Eriksen, and Stine Korreman. *Segment Anything Model for Head and Neck Tumor Segmentation with CT, PET and MRI Multi-Modality Images*. 20th International Conference on the Use of Computers in Radiation Therapy, Lyon, France, July 8-11, 2024.

This citation reflects the authors and the context in which the dataset was used, as it is not a publicly available dataset but rather a local dataset used for the study.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset details and the citation for inclusion in the structured output. This will ensure that the dataset is properly documented for future reference or analysis.
