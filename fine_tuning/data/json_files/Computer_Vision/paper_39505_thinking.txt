To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generated Loss and Augmented Training of MNIST VAE" by Jason Chou, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the MNIST dataset, which is a well-known dataset for training and testing machine learning models, particularly in the context of handwritten digit recognition.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.2 (Convolutional MNIST VAE setup)**, where the author explicitly states that they use the **MNIST dataset**. The paper mentions that they utilize the original training/testing split of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. This section provides a clear indication of the dataset being used.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **MNIST Dataset**: 
  > Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. 2010. URL http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

Since the MNIST dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset name, description, and citation, ready for any further processing or review.
