To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tailored Visions: Enhancing Text-to-Image Generation with Personalized Prompt Rewriting" by Zijie Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors have created a "large-scale text-to-image dataset with over 300k prompts from 3115 users," which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Personalized Image-Prompt (PIP) Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they compiled. Here, they describe the dataset as containing "300,237 image-prompt pairs, personally categorized by 3,115 users." This section will provide essential details about the dataset's structure, size, and purpose.

In this section, the authors also mention that the dataset is divided into training and testing samples, with 294,007 training samples and 6,230 test samples. This information is crucial for understanding how the dataset can be utilized in experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the PIP dataset within the text, but they mention that it will be made public upon paper acceptance. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is forthcoming and will be available at the provided GitHub link: https://github.com/zzjchen/Tailored-Visions.

Since the dataset is newly created and not previously published, I will document it as follows:

1. **Personalized Image-Prompt (PIP) Dataset**: This dataset consists of 300,237 image-prompt pairs collected from 3,115 users, aimed at enhancing personalized text-to-image generation. The dataset will be publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation details as required. Since the dataset is not yet formally cited in a publication, I will note the GitHub repository as the source.

After completing these steps, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset extracted from the paper, ready for further processing or review.
