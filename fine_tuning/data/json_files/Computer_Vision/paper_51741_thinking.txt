To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention-based Proposals Refinement for 3D Object Detection" by Minh-Quan Dao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention achieving competitive performance on the **KITTI** and **NuScenes** datasets, indicating that these are the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: The authors describe it as containing 7481 training samples and 7581 testing samples, with sensory measurements collected by LiDAR and cameras. They also note a common practice of splitting the training data into validation samples.

2. **NuScenes Dataset**: This dataset is described as more challenging, containing 28130 training samples and 6019 validation samples, with annotations for 23 object classes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **KITTI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2012.

- For the **NuScenes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alexander H. Lang, Shubham Vora, and others. *NuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
