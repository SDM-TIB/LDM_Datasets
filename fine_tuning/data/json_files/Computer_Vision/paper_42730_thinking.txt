To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3D medical image segmentation with labeled and unlabeled data using autoencoders at the example of liver segmentation in CT images" by Cheryl Sitala et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not specify datasets, it sets the context for the research. The introduction often discusses the significance of the datasets used, which can provide insights into their relevance.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Data)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. This section is divided into subsections for annotated and unannotated data, which will help me categorize the datasets effectively.

In **subsection 2.1 (Annotated data)**, the authors mention two specific datasets:

1. **Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD)**: This dataset consists of 131 liver training images used for model training and hyperparameter tuning. The images are sourced from various clinical sites and include diverse pathological cases.

2. **Beyond the Cranial Vault segmentation challenge**: This dataset includes 30 test images derived from various clinical scanners, used for evaluating the final models.

In **subsection 2.2 (Unannotated data)**, the authors describe additional supplementary data comprising 1277 images from various anatomical regions (lung, pancreas, hepatic vessel, spleen, and colon) that were used to investigate the impact of unlabeled data on the learning strategies.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will facilitate easy reference for anyone interested in the datasets used in this research.
