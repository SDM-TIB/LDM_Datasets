To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unite and Conquer: Cross Dataset Multimodal Synthesis using Diffusion Models" by Nithin Gopalakrishnan Nair et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that might be mentioned. The abstract discusses multimodal generation and references existing datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant sections that might describe the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using the **CelebA-HQ dataset** and the **FFHQ dataset** for multimodal face generation. I will note the details provided about these datasets, including their purpose and any specific characteristics mentioned.

In the **experiments section**, the authors elaborate on how they utilized these datasets. They specify that they selected 27,000 images from both the CelebA-HQ and FFHQ datasets for training and 3,000 images for testing. This information is crucial for understanding the context in which these datasets were used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For the **CelebA-HQ dataset**, the citation is:
> Liu, Z., Liu, Y., Yang, M., Huang, Z., & Wang, Z. (2018). *CelebA-HQ: A Large-Scale Benchmark for High-Quality Face Generation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 111–120.

For the **FFHQ dataset**, the citation is:
> Karras, T., Laine, S., & Aila, T. (2019). *A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 4401–4410.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration or replication of the study.
