To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Relationship Between Self-Attention and Convolutional Layers" by Jean-Baptiste Cordonnier et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will specifically check sections that discuss the experimental setup, as they typically contain detailed information about the datasets used. 

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research. For instance, if the authors mention using a particular dataset for training or evaluation, I will note down the details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation typically includes the authors, title, conference or journal name, and publication year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review, ensuring that all dataset citations are complete and accurate.
