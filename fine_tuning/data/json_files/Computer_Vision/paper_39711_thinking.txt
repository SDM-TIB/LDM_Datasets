To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stochastically Dominant Distributional Reinforcement Learning" by John D. Martin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will specifically check sections that discuss the methodology or experimental setup, as these sections typically detail the datasets used. I will pay close attention to any mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets that are explicitly named. For example, if the authors mention using a specific dataset for training or evaluation, I will record its name and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, types of data, or specific tasks it was used for.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

If the paper discusses well-known datasets, I will verify the citations against existing literature to ensure accuracy. For instance, if a dataset is widely recognized in the field, I will cross-reference it with its original publication to confirm the citation details.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of use. This will include a brief description of each dataset, its relevance to the research, and the complete citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all datasets mentioned in the paper, maintaining a high standard of academic rigor.
