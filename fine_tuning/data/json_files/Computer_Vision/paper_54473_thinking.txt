To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Spatial-Temporal Information Fusion for LiDAR-Based 3D Moving Object Segmentation" by Jiadai Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors verify their method on the **LiDAR-MOS benchmark of SemanticKITTI**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the introduction, the authors mention the **SemanticKITTI-MOS dataset** and describe its structure, indicating that it is used for training and evaluation. They also mention the **KITTI-road dataset**, which they annotated to enrich their training data.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the **SemanticKITTI-MOS dataset**, stating that it contains 22 sequences, with specific splits for training, validation, and testing. They also mention the use of the **KITTI-road dataset** for additional training data, which is important for understanding the context of their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **SemanticKITTI-MOS dataset**: The citation is:
   > X. Chen, S. Li, B. Mersch, L. Wiesmann, J. Gall, J. Behley, and C. Stachniss. "Moving Object Segmentation in 3D LiDAR Data: A Learning-based Approach Exploiting Sequential Data." *IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)*, vol. 6, pp. 6529–6536, 2021.

2. **KITTI-road dataset**: The citation is:
   > A. Geiger, P. Lenz, and R. Urtasun. "Are We Ready for Autonomous Driving? The KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite." In *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*, pp. 3354–3361, 2012.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
