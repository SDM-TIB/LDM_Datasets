To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Empirical Study on the Relation between Network Interpretability and Adversarial Robustness" by Adam Noack et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions conducting experiments on **MNIST and CIFAR-10**, which suggests these datasets are used in the study.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In **section 4.1 (Experiments)**, the authors describe their experimental setup for both MNIST and CIFAR-10. They detail the architecture used, the training techniques, and the adversarial attacks applied to these datasets.

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The authors mention using the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digits. They describe the architecture and training process for the convolutional neural network (CNN) used in their experiments.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: Similarly, the authors detail their experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. They describe the Wide ResNet architecture used for training on this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. URL: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For the **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. URL: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation for each dataset used in the experiments.
