To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating Electronic Health Records with Multiple Data Types and Constraints" by Chao Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors analyze over **770,000 EHRs from Vanderbilt University Medical Center**, which suggests that this is a primary dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look into the **Data Overview** section, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets they used. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Synthetic Derivative (SD)**: This dataset consists of **928,089 records** and includes various types of data such as age, gender, ICD-9 codes, CPT-4 codes, BMI, and blood pressure readings.

2. **Clean Synthetic Derivative (CSD)**: This refined dataset contains **770,231 records** and has undergone several cleaning processes to ensure data quality. It includes similar types of data as the SD but with stricter criteria for inclusion.

In the **Results** and **Method** sections, the authors discuss how they utilized these datasets for their experiments and model evaluations, confirming their importance in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from the authors' own work and not from external sources, I will note that the citations for the datasets are not traditional references but rather descriptions of the datasets created by the authors.

For the **Synthetic Derivative (SD)**, I will summarize it as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: Synthetic Derivative (SD)
- **Description**: A dataset containing 928,089 electronic health records with various features including age, gender, ICD-9 codes, CPT-4 codes, BMI, and blood pressure readings.

For the **Clean Synthetic Derivative (CSD)**, I will summarize it similarly:
- **Dataset Name**: Clean Synthetic Derivative (CSD)
- **Description**: A refined dataset containing 770,231 records, cleaned to remove noise and ensure quality, including similar features as the SD.

Since these datasets are not published in a traditional sense, I will not provide external citations but will note that they are derived from the authors' research at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
