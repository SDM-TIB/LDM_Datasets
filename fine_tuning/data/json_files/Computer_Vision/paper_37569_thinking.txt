To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Robustness of Interpretability Methods" by David Alvarez-Melis and Tommi S. Jaakkola, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses robustness in interpretability methods but does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss various interpretability methods but do not explicitly mention any datasets.

Moving on to **section 3 (Experiments)**, I will focus on the subsections that detail the methods and datasets used. In **subsection 3.1**, the authors mention that they evaluate interpretability methods on standard machine learning datasets from the UCI repository and the COMPAS dataset. This indicates that these datasets are relevant to their experiments.

In **subsection 3.2 (Benchmark Classiﬁcation and Regression Datasets)**, the authors specify that they use various datasets, including:

1. **UCI Datasets**: The authors refer to multiple datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository but do not list them individually. I will need to reference the repository for specific datasets used in their experiments.

2. **COMPAS Dataset**: This dataset is explicitly mentioned and is used for evaluating the robustness of interpretability methods.

3. **MNIST Dataset**: The authors mention using the MNIST dataset for explaining predictions of a CNN classifier.

4. **IMAGENET Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned in the context of explaining predictions of a ResNet classifier.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**, the citation is:
  > Lichman, Moshe, and Bache, Kevin. *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. 2013. URL: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml.

- For the **COMPAS dataset**, the citation is:
  > ProPublica. *Machine Bias*. 2016. URL: https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing.

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Yann, Bottou, Léon, Bengio, Yoshua, and Haffner, Patrick. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2323, 1998. doi: 10.1109/5.726791.

- For the **IMAGENET dataset**, the citation is:
  > He, Kaiming, Zhang, Xiangyu, Ren, Shaoqing, and Sun, Jian. *Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition*. In 2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 770–778, 2016. doi: 10.1109/CVPR.2016.90.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
