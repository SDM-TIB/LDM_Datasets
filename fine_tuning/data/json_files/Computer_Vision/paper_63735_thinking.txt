To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IT3D: Improved Text-to-3D Generation with Explicit View Synthesis" by Yiwen Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the generation of posed high-quality images based on coarse 3D models, which suggests that datasets are involved in the process.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Method)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset Generation)**, where the authors detail their data generation strategy. Here, they describe how they create a dataset of posed images (denoted as D) from a coarse 3D model and then enhance this dataset (denoted as D′) using an image-to-image pipeline. This indicates that the datasets are generated rather than sourced from existing datasets.

In this section, the authors mention that the dataset comprises images generated from various camera poses around the 3D model, with the number of images ranging from 24 to 60, and 3 to 7 images sampled for each viewpoint. However, they do not provide specific names or citations for any pre-existing datasets, as their approach focuses on generating new datasets.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets directly, I will note that the datasets created (D and D′) are unique to their methodology and do not have traditional citations. However, I will still document the process and the nature of these datasets.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the datasets into a structured format, ensuring to include the details about how they are generated and their characteristics, even though they do not have formal citations like traditional datasets.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, noting that the datasets are generated through the authors' methodology and do not correspond to any pre-existing datasets with citations. This will be important for understanding the context of their experiments and results.
