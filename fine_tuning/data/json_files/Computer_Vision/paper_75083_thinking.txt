To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Artificial Inductive Bias for Synthetic Tabular Data Generation in Data-Scarce Scenarios" by Patricia A. ApellÃ¡niz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions that the methodology is validated using "four public datasets obtained from the SDV environment," indicating that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for validation. Here, they list four datasets:

1. **Adult Census Income Dataset**: This dataset contains 32,561 data points with 14 features, used to predict whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50,000. It is noted that the dataset has 13% missing values.

2. **News Popularity Prediction Dataset**: Comprising 39,644 samples and 58 columns, this dataset includes information about articles published on the Mashable news blog and is used to predict article popularity based on social media shares.

3. **King County House Sales Dataset**: This regression dataset contains 21,613 house sale prices for King County, Washington, with 20 features providing multivariate information.

4. **KDD Cup 1999 Data**: This dataset includes 494,021 samples and 39 features, used to classify connections in a military network environment.

I will then check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Adult Census Income Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Becker, B., & Kohavi, R. (1996). *Adult*. UCI Machine Learning Repository. DOI: https://doi.org/10.24432/C5XW20.

- For the **News Popularity Prediction Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Fernandes, K., Vinagre, P., Cortez, P., & Sernadela, P. (2015). *Online News Popularity*. UCI Machine Learning Repository. DOI: https://doi.org/10.24432/C5NS3V.

- For the **King County House Sales Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Unknown. (2014). *King County House Sales*. UCI Machine Learning Repository. DOI: https://doi.org/10.24432/C56C76.

- For the **KDD Cup 1999 Data**, the citation is:
  > Stolfo, S. J., Fan, W., Lee, W., Prodromidis, A., & Chan, P. (1999). *KDD Cup 1999 Data*. UCI Machine Learning Repository. DOI: https://doi.org/10.24432/C51C7N.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
