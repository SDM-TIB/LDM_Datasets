To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Semantic Modular Framework for Events Topic Modeling in Social Media" by Arya Hadizadeh Moghaddam and Saeedeh Momtazi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method was evaluated on three English Twitter datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Results)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **FACup**: This dataset is derived from the 2012 final match of the FAC football tournament, where Chelsea beat Liverpool. It includes tweets collected during the match and the break, with 12 topics identified for the events.

2. **SuperTuesday**: This dataset pertains to the American election system, specifically the Super Tuesday event where multiple states hold elections to nominate candidates. The authors collected tweets related to this event and identified 22 topics.

3. **USElection**: This dataset is related to the presidential election in the USA on July 6, 2014, when Barack Obama was elected. It includes tweets and identifies 64 topics as golden data.

To ensure accuracy, I will also check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. However, since these datasets are derived from specific events and not standalone publications, I will cite the paper itself as the source for these datasets.

The citations for the datasets will be as follows:

- For **FACup**, the citation is:
  > Hadizadeh Moghaddam, A., & Momtazi, S. (2023). A Semantic Modular Framework for Events Topic Modeling in Social Media. *Journal of Computer Engineering*, 1(1), 1-30.

- For **SuperTuesday**, the citation is the same as above.

- For **USElection**, the citation is also the same as above.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
