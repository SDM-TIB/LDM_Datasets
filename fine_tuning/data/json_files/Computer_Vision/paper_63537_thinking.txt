To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-Time Automatic M-Mode Echocardiography Measurement with Panel Attention from Local-to-Global Pixels" by Ching-Hsun Tseng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a dataset called **MEIS**, which is specifically designed for M-mode echocardiograms. This is a strong indication that I need to gather more details about this dataset.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3 (MEIS Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. Here, they mention that MEIS consists of **2,639 images** with specific annotations for two recording views: Aortic Valve (AV) and Left Ventricle (LV). The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, with specific counts for each view.

The authors also describe the **preparation process** for the dataset, including how the images were collected and the manual labeling process involved. This section confirms the dataset's purpose and its relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MEIS dataset. However, since MEIS is a new dataset introduced in this paper, it may not have a separate citation in the references. Instead, I will note that the dataset is introduced and described in this paper itself.

The citation for the paper is:
> Ching-Hsun Tseng, Po-Shen Wang, Shao-Ju Chien, Shin-Jye Lee, Wei-Huan Hu, Bin Pu, Xiao-jun Zeng. *Real-Time Automatic M-Mode Echocardiography Measurement with Panel Attention from Local-to-Global Pixels*. Preprint, August 16, 2023.

In summary, I will create an entry for the MEIS dataset, including its description and the citation for the paper. This will ensure that the dataset is properly documented and attributed to the authors who created it.
