To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SuGaR: Surface-Aligned Gaussian Splatting for Efficient 3D Mesh Reconstruction and High-Quality Mesh Rendering" by Antoine GuÃ©don and Vincent Lepetit, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the method and its contributions, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and experiments sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss their method and its advantages over existing techniques, but they do not mention specific datasets yet. I will continue to the **experiments section** where datasets are typically described in detail.

In **section 5 (Experiments)**, the authors mention that they evaluate their model on three different datasets: **Mip-NeRF360**, **DeepBlending**, and **Tanks&Temples**. This is a crucial finding as it indicates the datasets used for their experiments.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. **Mip-NeRF360**: The citation is:
   > Jonathan T. Barron. *Mip-NeRF 360: Unbounded Anti-Aliased Neural Radiance Fields*. In Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2022.

2. **DeepBlending**: The citation is:
   > Peter Hedman, Julien Philip, True Price, Jan-Michael Frahm, George Drettakis, and Gabriel Brostow. *Deep Blending for Free-Viewpoint Image-Based Rendering*. In ACM SIGGRAPH, 2018.

3. **Tanks&Temples**: The citation is:
   > Arno Knapitsch, Jaesik Park, Qian-Yi Zhou, and Vladlen Koltun. *Tanks and Temples: Benchmarking Large-Scale Scene Reconstruction*. In ACM SIGGRAPH, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

- **Mip-NeRF360**: A dataset used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method.
- **DeepBlending**: Another dataset utilized for testing the method's effectiveness.
- **Tanks&Temples**: A dataset included in the experiments to benchmark the proposed approach.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or analysis.
