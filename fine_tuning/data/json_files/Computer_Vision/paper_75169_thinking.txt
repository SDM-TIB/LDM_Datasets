To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DGR-MIL: Exploring Diverse Global Representation in Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification" by Wenhui Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the **CAMELYON-16** and **TCGA-lung cancer** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, the authors explicitly mention the datasets they used for validation and testing. 

1. **CAMELYON-16 Dataset**: This dataset is referenced multiple times throughout the paper, particularly in the context of evaluating the proposed model's performance. The authors describe it as a benchmark dataset for histopathological image classification.

2. **TCGA-lung cancer Dataset (TCGA-NSCLC)**: Similar to CAMELYON-16, this dataset is also mentioned as a benchmark for testing the proposed method. The authors provide details about how the dataset was partitioned for training, validation, and testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **CAMELYON-16 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bejnordi, B.E., Veta, M., Van Diest, P.J., Van Ginneken, B., Karssemeijer, N., Litjens, G., et al. *Diagnostic assessment of deep learning algorithms for detection of lymph node metastases in women with breast cancer*. JAMA 318(22), 2199–2210, 2017.

- For the **TCGA-lung cancer Dataset**, the citation is:
  > The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. *Comprehensive molecular profiling of lung adenocarcinoma*. Nature 511(7511), 543–550, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
