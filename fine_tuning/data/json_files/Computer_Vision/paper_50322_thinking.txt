To extract datasets from the research paper titled "High-order Tensor Pooling with Attention for Action Recognition" by Piotr Koniusz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for a dedicated subsection that discusses the datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors mention three datasets used for evaluation: **HMDB-51**, **YUP++**, and **MPII Cooking Activities**. I will note down the specific details provided for each dataset, such as the number of videos, classes, and any relevant characteristics.

Next, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

1. **HMDB-51**: The paper states that HMDB-51 consists of 6766 internet videos across 51 classes. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Kuehne, H., Jhuang, H., Garrote, E., Poggio, T., & Serre, T. (2011). *HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2556–2563.

2. **YUP++**: This dataset contains video textures captured with static or moving cameras, comprising 20 scene classes and 60 videos per class. The citation is:
   > Wang, L., & Koniusz, P. (2018). *YUP++: A dataset for video texture recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1–10.

3. **MPII Cooking Activities**: This dataset includes 64 activities in 3748 clips, focusing on fine-grained actions like peeling and slicing. The citation is:
   > Rohrbach, M., Amin, S., Andriluka, M., & Schiele, B. (2012). *A database for fine grained activity detection of cooking activities*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1–10.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
