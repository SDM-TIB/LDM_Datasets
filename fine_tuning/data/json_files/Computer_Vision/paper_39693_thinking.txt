To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Haze Image Synthesis and Dehazing with MMD-VAE Losses" by Zongliang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the importance of haze image synthesis and dehazing, which suggests that datasets related to these tasks may be included.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Implementation Details)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they state that they used the **Apollo dataset** for synthesizing haze images. The authors specify that they randomly chose 2000 traffic scene images and corresponding depth images from this dataset.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the **Apollo dataset** in the **References section**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Xinyu Huang, Xinjing Cheng, Qichuan Geng, Binbin Cao, Dingfu Zhou, Peng Wang, Yuanqing Lin, and Ruigang Yang. *The Apolloscape Dataset for Autonomous Driving*. arXiv: 1803.06184, 2018.

Since the Apollo dataset is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered.

I will summarize the dataset details as follows:
1. **Apollo Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2000 traffic scene images and corresponding depth images, which were used to synthesize haze images for the experiments.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the full citation for the Apollo dataset ready for inclusion in any structured output or documentation. This thorough approach guarantees that I have accurately captured the necessary dataset information from the paper.
