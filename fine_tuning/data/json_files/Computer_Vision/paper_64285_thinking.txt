To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spectral Adversarial MixUp for Few-Shot Unsupervised Domain Adaptation" by Jiajin Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on multiple public datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any explicit mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of domain shift in clinical applications but does not specify dataset names. However, it sets the context for the experiments that will likely follow.

I will then focus on the **experiments and results section** (section 3), where the authors describe their evaluations. Here, they mention two specific datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Fundus Dataset**: This dataset is used for an optic disc and cup segmentation task. The authors state that the source domain consists of 400 images from the REFUGE training set, while the target domain includes images from the REFUGE validation set and RIM-One dataset.

2. **Camelyon Dataset**: This dataset is used for tumor tissue binary classification across multiple hospitals. The source domain comprises 302,436 images from hospitals 1 to 3, while the target domains consist of validation and test sets from hospitals 4 and 5.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **REFUGE dataset**, the citation is:
  > Orlando, J.I., Fu, H., Breda, J.B., Van Keer, K., Bathula, D.R., Diaz-Pinto, A., Fang, R., Heng, P.A., Kim, J., Lee, J., et al. *REFUGE Challenge: A Unified Framework for Evaluating Automated Methods for Glaucoma Assessment from Fundus Photographs*. Medical Image Analysis, 59, 101570, 2020.

- For the **Camelyon dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bandi, P., Geessink, O., Manson, Q., Van Dijk, M., Balkenhol, M., Hermsen, M., Bejnordi, B.E., Lee, B., Paeng, K., Zhong, A., et al. *From Detection of Individual Metastases to Classification of Lymph Node Status at the Patient Level: The Camelyon17 Challenge*. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 37(5), 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
