To extract datasets from the research paper titled "InterHandGen: Two-Hand Interaction Generation via Cascaded Reverse Diffusion" by Jihyun Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the significance of the datasets in the context of the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors refer to a "large-scale two-hand interaction dataset" and mention that various methods have been proposed for monocular two-hand reconstruction. This indicates that a specific dataset is likely referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention using the **InterHand2.6M dataset** for their experiments. They describe it as the most widely used interacting two-hand dataset, consisting of 366K training samples, 110K validation samples, and 261K test samples.

Additionally, in the **object-conditioned two-hand synthesis section**, the authors mention using the **ARCTIC dataset**, which captures diverse two-hand and object interaction scenarios, containing 339 sequences of interaction with 10 objects.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **InterHand2.6M dataset**, the citation is:
   > Gyeongsik Moon, Shoou-I Yu, He Wen, Takaaki Shiratori, and Kyoung Mu Lee. *Interhand2.6m: A dataset and baseline for 3d interacting hand pose estimation from a single rgb image*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2020.

2. For the **ARCTIC dataset**, the citation is:
   > Zicong Fan, Omid Taheri, Dimitrios Tzionas, Muhammed Kocabas, Manuel Kaufmann, Michael J Black, and Otmar Hilliges. *ARCTIC: A dataset for dexterous bimanual hand-object manipulation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
