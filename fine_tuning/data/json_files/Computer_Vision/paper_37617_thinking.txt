To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Resembled Generative Adversarial Networks" by Duhyeon Bang and Hyunjung Shim, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experimental analysis on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments in section 4, where they evaluate their model on different datasets. 

In **section 4 (Evaluation)**, the authors specifically mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **CelebA Dataset**: This dataset is used to evaluate the model's performance on generating human faces with various attributes. The authors mention that they divided the CelebA dataset into two domains based on attribute labels such as gender and hair color.

2. **Cat Head Dataset**: This dataset consists of images of cat heads, which were extracted using facial key points from 10,000 cat images. The authors note that they used 9,000 images for training and 1,000 images for testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **CelebA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 3730–3738, 2015.

- For the **Cat Head Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Weiwei Zhang, Jian Sun, and Xiaoou Tang. *Cat Head Detection - How to Effectively Exploit Shape and Texture Features*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 802–816. Springer, 2008.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will allow for proper referencing and further analysis of the datasets used in the research.
