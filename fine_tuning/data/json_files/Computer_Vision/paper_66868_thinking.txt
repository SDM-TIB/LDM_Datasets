To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Particle-based Anomaly Detection Algorithm with Variational Autoencoder" by Ryan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a new anomaly detection algorithm, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and experiments sections for more details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of anomaly detection in high-energy physics and mention the need for efficient data processing. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets here.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their evaluation methods. In **section 4.1**, they introduce the **JetClass dataset**, which is a large-scale dataset containing 125 million jets from various particle types. This section provides a detailed description of the dataset's composition and its application in training their anomaly detection model.

The paper references the JetClass dataset as being introduced in **Ref. [24]**, which is crucial for obtaining the full citation. I will look at the **References section** to find the complete citation for this dataset.

Upon reviewing the references, I find the citation for the JetClass dataset:
> Huilin Qu, Congqiao Li, and Sitian Qian. *Particle transformer for jet tagging*. 2022.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **JetClass Dataset**: A large-scale dataset containing 125 million jets from ten different types of particles, used for training anomaly detection models.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
