To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimality of Thompson Sampling with Noninformative Priors for Pareto Bandits" by Jongyeong Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract often summarizes the key contributions and may mention datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors typically discuss the context of their research and may reference specific datasets that are relevant to their work. I will look for phrases like "we evaluated our method on" or "we used the following datasets."

Then, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments sections** in detail. These sections often provide explicit details about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. I will take note of any datasets that are described, including any specific parameters or configurations mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will look for papers or reports that describe the datasets in detail.

For each dataset identified, I will ensure to document the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details (e.g., number of samples, features).
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, formatted according to academic standards.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its description and citation. This will ensure that the datasets are well-documented and easily accessible for future reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper while maintaining academic integrity through proper citations.
