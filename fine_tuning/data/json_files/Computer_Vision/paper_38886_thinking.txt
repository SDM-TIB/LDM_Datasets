To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatial-Temporal-Textual Point Processes with Applications in Crime Linkage Detection" by Shixiang Zhu and Yao Xie, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of real data for numerical results, which suggests that there may be a specific dataset referenced.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Real-data study)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention a dataset of **10,056 crime incidents recorded by the Atlanta Police Department from early 2016 to the end of 2017**. This dataset includes various attributes such as crime category, time, location, and text descriptions.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, in this case, the dataset is derived from police reports and does not have a formal citation like other datasets might. Instead, the authors acknowledge the Atlanta Police Department as the source of the data.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Atlanta Police Dataset**: This dataset consists of 10,056 crime incidents, which include structured data (time, location, crime category) and unstructured data (text descriptions). The dataset is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed crime linkage detection method.

Since the dataset does not have a formal citation in the references, I will note the source as the Atlanta Police Department.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry in a structured format, ensuring that I include the relevant details and the source of the dataset for clarity and proper attribution.
