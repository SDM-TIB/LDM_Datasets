To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bridging Different Language Models and Generative Vision Models for Text-to-Image Generation" by Shihao Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the integration of language and vision models for text-to-image generation, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, the authors mention that they trained their model on a dataset consisting of **1 million text-image pairs**, which includes **600k text-image pairs from the COCO2017 train set** and **400k text-image pairs from an internal dataset**.

I will now look for more details about these datasets:

1. **COCO2017 Dataset**: This dataset is widely known and is used for various computer vision tasks. It consists of images with corresponding captions, making it suitable for text-to-image generation tasks. The citation for the COCO dataset is:
   > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Doll√°r, P., Zitnick, C.L. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

2. **Internal Dataset**: The authors mention that this dataset contains high-quality images and captions but do not provide a specific citation or reference for it. Since it is an internal dataset, it may not have a formal citation available.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their descriptions and citations accurately. The COCO dataset is well-documented and can be cited appropriately, while the internal dataset will be noted as such without a formal citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and citations where applicable.
