To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Dist-PU: Positive-Unlabeled Learning from a Label Distribution Perspective" by Yunrui Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges of Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning and mention the datasets used for their experiments. They highlight that experiments were conducted on **Fashion-MNIST**, **CIFAR-10**, and an **Alzheimer dataset**.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a summary table (Table 1) that includes details about each dataset, such as input size, positive class, number of testing samples, number of unlabeled samples, number of labeled samples, and class prior probabilities. This table will help me gather specific information about each dataset.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the experiments.

1. **Fashion-MNIST**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. CoRR, 2017.

2. **CIFAR-10**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

3. **Alzheimer Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Dubey, S. *Alzheimerâ€™s Dataset*. Available online: https://www.kaggle.com/tourist55/alzheimers-dataset-4-class-of-images.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its respective citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
