To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Visual Tour of Current Challenges in Multimodal Language Models" by Shashank Sonkar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of learning function words and mentions the use of stable diffusion models, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction focuses on the challenges of function words and the potential of multimodal learning but does not provide specific dataset names.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will look for any detailed descriptions of datasets used for testing the stable diffusion models. The authors describe their methodology and the categories of function words they are probing, but they do not mention any specific datasets or provide citations for them.

In the **appendix**, the authors provide prompts and generated images for various categories of function words, but again, there are no specific datasets referenced. The paper emphasizes the need for new datasets to improve multimodal models' understanding of function words, suggesting that the authors may not have used established datasets but rather created their own prompts for testing.

Since the paper does not provide any specific datasets or their citations, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. However, I will note the authors' call for the development of new datasets in the field of multimodal language models.

In summary, I will document that the paper does not contain any specific datasets or citations, but it highlights the need for future work in constructing datasets for better understanding of function words in multimodal models.
