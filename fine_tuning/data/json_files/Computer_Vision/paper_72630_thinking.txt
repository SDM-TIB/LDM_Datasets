To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uniformly Stable Algorithms for Adversarial Training and Beyond" by Jiancong Xiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the issue of robust overfitting in adversarial training and mentions experiments conducted on common datasets such as **SVHN** and **CIFAR-10/100**. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** to gather more detailed information about the datasets. In this section, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on **SVHN** and **CIFAR-10/100**. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant splits or configurations used in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

1. **SVHN (Street View House Numbers)**: This dataset is commonly used for digit recognition tasks and consists of over 600,000 labeled digits. The citation for SVHN is:
   > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2011.

2. **CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100**: These datasets are widely used for image classification tasks. CIFAR-10 contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, while CIFAR-100 has 100 classes with 600 images each. The citation for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced accurately in future work.
