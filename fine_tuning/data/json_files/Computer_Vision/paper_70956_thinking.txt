To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IIDM: Image-to-Image Diffusion Model for Semantic Image Synthesis" by Feng Liu and Xiaobin Chang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses semantic image synthesis and mentions the use of a dataset for evaluation, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they collected **11,000 high-resolution landscape images** from the Flickr website, along with corresponding **semantic segmentation maps**. This indicates that the dataset consists of image-mask pairs, which are crucial for their semantic image synthesis task.

The authors specify that **10,000 image-mask pairs were used for training**, and the remaining **1,000 segmentation masks were provided for testing**. This detail is important as it outlines how the dataset is split for training and testing purposes.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is a collection of images from Flickr, I will need to cite it appropriately. The citation for the dataset can be structured as follows:

- **Flickr Landscape Dataset**: This dataset consists of high-resolution landscape images collected from the Flickr website, along with their corresponding semantic segmentation maps. The dataset is not attributed to a specific paper but can be referenced as:
  > Flickr. *Flickr Image Dataset*. Available at: https://www.flickr.com (Accessed: [insert access date]).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and clearly presented, ready for further processing or review.
