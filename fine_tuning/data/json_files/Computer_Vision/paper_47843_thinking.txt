To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mitigating Adversarial Attack for Compute-in-Memory Accelerator Utilizing On-chip Finetune" by Shanshi Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the **CIFAR-10 dataset** in the context of evaluating the impact of adversarial attacks on model accuracy. This indicates that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will check the **introduction** for further details. The introduction discusses adversarial attacks and mentions that the evaluation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method on the CIFAR-10 dataset. This reinforces the idea that CIFAR-10 is a key dataset used in their experiments.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the process of finetuning the model and refer to the CIFAR-10 dataset again, confirming its use in their experiments. They specify that they evaluate their proposed defense method using VGG-8 and DenseNet-40 networks on this dataset.

Moving to the **evaluation results section**, the authors present results based on the CIFAR-10 dataset, detailing the performance of their models under adversarial attacks. This section provides quantitative results that further validate the dataset's relevance to their research.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, and its citation is typically included in the literature. However, in this paper, the authors do not provide a specific citation for CIFAR-10. Therefore, I will use the standard citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset, which is:

- **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry for CIFAR-10, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

In summary, the key steps I followed are:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections to identify datasets.
2. Confirm the use of the CIFAR-10 dataset through multiple mentions in the text.
3. Retrieve the standard citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for CIFAR-10, ensuring it is ready for structured output.
