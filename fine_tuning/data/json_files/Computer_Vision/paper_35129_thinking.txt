To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conditional probability calculation using restricted Boltzmann machine with application to system identification" by Erick de la Rosa and Wen Yu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it discusses the advantages of using probability methods for system identification, it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the methodology and the context of their research. Here, they mention using "two benchmark nonlinear systems" for comparison, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for details about the datasets used for the experiments. The authors describe two specific benchmark examples: the **Gas Furnace Process** and the **Wiener-Hammerstein System**. I will extract the relevant details about these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were used in the experiments.

1. **Gas Furnace Process**: The dataset consists of 296 successive pairs of input (methane gas control) and output (CO2 concentration) samples, with 200 samples used for training and 96 for testing.

2. **Wiener-Hammerstein System**: This dataset includes 188,000 input/output pairs, with 100,000 samples for training and 88,000 for testing.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since these datasets are commonly used benchmarks in the field, they may not have formal citations in the references. Instead, I will note their common usage in the literature.

For the **Gas Furnace Process**, I will reference:
- Box, G., Jenkins, G., & Reinsel, G. (2008). *Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control* (4th ed.). Wiley.

For the **Wiener-Hammerstein System**, I will reference:
- Schoukens, J., Suykens, J., & Ljung, L. (2009). *Wiener-Hammerstein benchmark*. 15th IFAC Symposium on System Identification, Saint-Malo, France.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
