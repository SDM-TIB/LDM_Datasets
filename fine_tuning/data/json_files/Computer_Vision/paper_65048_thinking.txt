To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BID-NeRF: RGB-D image pose estimation with inverted Neural Radiance Fields" by Agoston Istvan Csehi and Csaba Mate Jozsa, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets that are relevant to their work. This section often provides context and may reference datasets that are foundational to the research.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. The authors may specify the datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in their approach. This section is crucial for understanding the datasets' relevance to the proposed method.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors discuss the performance of their method on specific datasets. This can provide additional confirmation of the datasets used and their significance in the research.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. It is essential to provide accurate citations for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Based on the content of the paper, I will identify the datasets and their corresponding citations. If the authors used a specific dataset for their experiments, I will ensure to include the full citation as follows:

- For the **Blender dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P. Srinivasan, Matthew Tancik, Jonathan T. Barron, Ravi Ramamoorthi, and Ren Ng. *NeRF: Representing scenes as neural radiance fields for view synthesis*. CoRR, abs/2003.08934, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further analysis or use of the datasets in related research.
