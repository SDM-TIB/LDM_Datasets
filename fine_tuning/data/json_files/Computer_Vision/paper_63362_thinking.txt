To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fluid Viscosity Prediction Leveraging Computer Vision and Robot Interaction" by Jong Hoon Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and results, which may hint at the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of measuring fluid viscosity and mention their approach involving video data of oscillating fluids. This suggests that they have collected specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Methods)**, particularly **subsection 3.1 (Experimental Setup and Video Collection)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup and the types of fluids used for video recordings. They mention two distinct datasets:

1. **Classification Dataset**: This dataset consists of videos recorded for five different fluids: water, coffee, oil, mango juice, and dish soap. The authors specify that this dataset includes a total of 148 videos, with each fluid contributing approximately 30 videos.

2. **Regression Dataset**: This dataset is composed of videos of glycerol solutions at eight different viscosity levels (0, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 90 vol%). The authors note that this dataset includes 232 videos, with each glycerol solution contributing around 30 videos.

To ensure accuracy, I will check the **data availability section** to see if the authors provide any links or references for these datasets. They mention that all RGB videos and segmented videos used to create the classification and regression datasets can be found in a public Google Drive.

Now, I will look for full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference a study for the viscosity of glycerol solutions:

- For the viscosity of glycerol solutions, the citation is:
  > John Bartlett Segur and Helen E. Oberstar. *Viscosity of glycerol and its aqueous solutions*. Industrial & Engineering Chemistry, 43:2117â€“2120, 1951.

The classification dataset does not have a specific citation since it is based on common household fluids, but I will note that it is derived from the authors' own experimental recordings.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations and descriptions as required.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **Classification Dataset**: Videos of five different fluids (water, coffee, oil, mango juice, dish soap).
2. **Regression Dataset**: Videos of glycerol solutions at eight different viscosity levels.

I will now prepare to format these findings into the required structure for further processing.
