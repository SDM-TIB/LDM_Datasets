To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dualing GANs" by Yujia Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on three datasets: a 2D dataset composed of 5 2D Gaussians, MNIST, and CIFAR-10. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments discussed in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to gather more details about each dataset. In section 4.1, the authors mention using the 5-Gaussians dataset and the MNIST dataset for their experiments with linear discriminators. They describe the 5-Gaussians dataset as a synthetic dataset generated by sampling points from a mixture of 5 2D Gaussian components. The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition.

In section 4.2, the authors discuss the use of the MNIST dataset and CIFAR-10 for experiments with non-linear discriminators. They mention that CIFAR-10 is a widely used dataset for image classification tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **5-Gaussians Dataset**: Since this is a synthetic dataset created by the authors, it may not have a formal citation. However, I will note that it is described as a mixture of 5 2D Gaussian components.

2. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
   > Y. LeCun, L. Bottou, Y. Bengio, and P. Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. IEEE, 1998.

3. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*, 2009.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for MNIST and CIFAR-10, while noting that the 5-Gaussians dataset is synthetic and does not have a formal citation.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper along with their proper citations.
