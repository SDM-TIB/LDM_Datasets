To extract datasets from the research paper titled "INFIMM-EVAL: Complex Open-Ended Reasoning Evaluation for Multi-Modal Large Language Models" by Xiaotian Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract indicates that the authors have curated a benchmark dataset specifically designed for evaluating multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) with a focus on complex reasoning tasks. This suggests that there is a dataset involved, but I need to look for specific names and details.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly focusing on any sections that explicitly mention datasets. In the methodology section, the authors describe their data collection process, which involves engaging annotators to source images and create questions and answers. They mention that they adopted 25 samples from the **MM-Vet** dataset, which is a clear indication of a dataset being used.

In the **results** section, the authors provide statistics about their InfiMM-Eval benchmark, which consists of 279 manually curated reasoning questions associated with a total of 342 images. This benchmark is the primary dataset they created for their evaluation.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **InfiMM-Eval Benchmark**: This is the primary dataset created by the authors for evaluating MLLMs. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Xiaotian Han, Quanzeng You, Yongfei Liu, Wentao Chen, Huangjie Zheng, Khalil Mrini, Xudong Lin, Yiqi Wang, Bohan Zhai, Jianbo Yuan, Heng Wang, and Hongxia Yang. *INFIMM-EVAL: Complex Open-Ended Reasoning Evaluation for Multi-Modal Large Language Models*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].

2. **MM-Vet Dataset**: This dataset was used as a source for some of the images in the InfiMM-Eval benchmark. The citation for the MM-Vet dataset is:
   > Weihao Yu, Zhengyuan Yang, Linjie Li, Jianfeng Wang, Kevin Lin, Zicheng Liu, Xinchao Wang, and Lijuan Wang. *MM-VET: Evaluating Large Multimodal Models for Integrated Capabilities*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets and their citations, ready for any further processing or review.
