To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VAE2: Preventing Posterior Collapse of Variational Video Predictions in the Wild" by Yizhou Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on a large-scale dataset called **Cityscapes**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is relevant.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using the **Cityscapes dataset** for their evaluations. They describe it as containing urban street scenes from 50 different cities, captured at 17 fps, which provides a clear context for the dataset's application.

I will also check the **related work** and **conclusion sections** to see if any other datasets are referenced or if there are any additional details about the Cityscapes dataset. However, it appears that the Cityscapes dataset is the primary dataset utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the Cityscapes dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

> Cordts, M.; Omran, M.; Ramos, S.; Rehfeld, T.; Enzweiler, M.; Benenson, R.; Franke, U.; Roth, S.; and Schiele, B. (2016). *The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, 3213â€“3223.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extraction:

1. **Cityscapes Dataset**: This dataset contains urban street scenes from 50 different cities, captured at 17 fps. It is used for evaluating the proposed VAE2 method in the context of video prediction.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included for proper referencing.
