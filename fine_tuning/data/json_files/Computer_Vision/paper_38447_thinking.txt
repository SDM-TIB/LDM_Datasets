To extract datasets from the research paper titled "You Look Twice: GaterNet for Dynamic Filter Selection in CNNs" by Zhourong Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to experiments conducted on **CIFAR and ImageNet datasets**, which indicates that these datasets are likely to be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a description of the datasets used:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset contains natural images belonging to 10 classes, with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The authors mention that the raw images are 32 × 32 pixels and that standard data augmentation techniques are applied.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains images belonging to 100 classes, also with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The same image size and augmentation techniques are noted.

3. **ImageNet 2012**: This dataset is described as containing 1.28 million training images and 50,000 validation images across 1,000 classes. The authors specify that they use standard data augmentation methods as per the original papers of the baseline models.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, 2009.

- For **ImageNet 2012**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, Alexander C. Berg, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 115(3):211–252, 2015.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
