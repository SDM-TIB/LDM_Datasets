To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Bayesian Case Model: A Generative Approach for Case-Based Reasoning and Prototype Classification" by Been Kim, Cynthia Rudin, and Julie Shah, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of case-based reasoning and prototype classification, but I need to look for specific datasets. I will pay attention to any mentions of datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, particularly **section 4**, where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention using two standard datasets: 

1. **Handwritten Digit Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as being used for evaluating the performance of the Bayesian Case Model (BCM). The authors mention that they randomly sampled 10 to 70 observations of each digit for this dataset.

2. **20 Newsgroups Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned as a benchmark for evaluating the BCM. The authors state that they used 100-450 documents per document class for this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Handwritten Digit Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J.J. Hull. *A database for handwritten text recognition research*. TPAMI, 1994.

- For the **20 Newsgroups Dataset**, the citation is:
  > K. Lang. *Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews*. In ICML, 1995.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its full citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly credited in any subsequent analysis or documentation.
