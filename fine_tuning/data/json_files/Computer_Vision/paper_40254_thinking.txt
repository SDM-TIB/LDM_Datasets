To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Semantic Scene Completion Network with Spatial Group Convolution" by Jiahui Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method is validated on the **SUNCG dataset**, which is a clear indication that this dataset is significant for the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about the datasets used. The introduction mentions the importance of 3D datasets for tasks like semantic scene completion, reinforcing the relevance of the SUNCG dataset.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in **section 3.4 (Implementation Details)**, the authors provide specific information about the dataset. They describe the SUNCG dataset as a manually created large-scale synthetic scene dataset containing 139,368 valid pairs of depth maps and complete labels for training, and 470 pairs for testing. This section confirms that the SUNCG dataset is the primary dataset used for training and evaluation.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the SUNCG dataset. The relevant citation is:
> Song, S., Yu, F., Zeng, A., Chang, A.X., Savva, M., Funkhouser, T. (2017). *Semantic scene completion from a single depth image*. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017 IEEE Conference on. pp. 190â€“198.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **SUNCG Dataset**: A large-scale synthetic scene dataset used for training and evaluation, containing 139,368 valid pairs of depth maps and complete labels for training, and 470 pairs for testing.

Finally, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that the full citation is included for the SUNCG dataset.
