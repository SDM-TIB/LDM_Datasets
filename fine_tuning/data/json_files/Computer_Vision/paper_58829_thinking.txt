To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncovering Bias in Face Generation Models" by Cristian Muñoz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the implications of bias in generative models, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction highlights the importance of representative datasets in machine learning applications, which suggests that datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **results** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for experiments. In the **methodology** section, the authors mention using the **CelebA dataset** and the **FFHQ dataset** for training their models. This is a crucial finding, as it indicates the datasets employed in their analysis.

In the **results** section, the authors provide insights into the performance of various models trained on these datasets. They specifically analyze the outputs generated by models trained on the **CelebA** and **FFHQ** datasets, discussing the biases observed in the generated images.

Now, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **CelebA Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 373–378, 2015.

2. **FFHQ Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. *A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 4401–4410, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, which is essential for understanding the context and implications of the findings presented by the authors.
