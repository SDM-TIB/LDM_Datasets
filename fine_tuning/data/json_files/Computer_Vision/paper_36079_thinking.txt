To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Eye In-Painting with Exemplar Generative Adversarial Networks" by Brian Dolhansky and Cristian Canton Ferrer, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that a new benchmark dataset is introduced for eye in-painting, which suggests that there are specific datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the need for a dataset that contains pairs of images for each object. They mention the development of an internal training set of roughly 2 million 2D-aligned images of around 200K individuals, which is crucial information.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used. They mention that they created an internal dataset with at least 3 images per individual, and they also developed an eye in-painting benchmark from high-quality images of celebrities, containing around 17K identities and a total of 100K images. They also reference a publicly available benchmark called Celeb-ID.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets from the **references section**:

1. **Internal Training Set**: This dataset is described in the paper but does not have a formal citation since it is an internal dataset created by the authors. However, I will note it as:
   > Internal dataset of approximately 2 million 2D-aligned images of around 200K individuals, with at least 3 images per individual.

2. **Eye In-Painting Benchmark**: This dataset is also created by the authors and does not have a formal citation. I will note it as:
   > Eye in-painting benchmark from high-quality images of celebrities, containing around 17K identities and a total of 100K images.

3. **Celeb-ID Dataset**: The authors mention this dataset as a publicly available benchmark, but they do not provide a formal citation in the references. I will note it as:
   > Celeb-ID dataset, a publicly available benchmark created by the authors.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the necessary details and citations for each dataset, even if they are informal or internal. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
