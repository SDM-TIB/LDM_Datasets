To extract datasets from the research paper titled "n-CPS: Generalising Cross Pseudo Supervision to n Networks for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation" by Dominik Filipiak et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed method sets a new state-of-the-art for **Pascal VOC 2012** and **Cityscapes**, indicating that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the benefits of semi-supervised learning for semantic segmentation and reference the datasets used for evaluation. This reinforces the idea that **Pascal VOC 2012** and **Cityscapes** are central to their experiments.

In the **evaluation section**, particularly **section 3.1**, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their method on the **PASCAL VOC 2012** and **Cityscapes** datasets. They provide details about the number of classes in each dataset, which further confirms their usage.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **PASCAL VOC 2012**, the citation is:
   > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2):303–338, 2010.

2. For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:
   > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3213–3223, 2016.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now compile this information into a structured format for further use. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
