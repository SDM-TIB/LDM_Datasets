To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Animate Your Motion: Turning Still Images into Dynamic Videos" by Mingxiao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the integration of various inputs for video generation, but it does not specify any datasets. However, the introduction discusses the challenges and advancements in text-to-video generation, which may lead to the identification of datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), particularly **subsection 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets utilized in their research. Here, they state that they used the **GOT10K** and **YTVIS 2021** datasets, providing a brief description of each:

1. **GOT10K Dataset**: This dataset is widely recognized in single object tracking research and consists of over 10,000 video segments dedicated to tracking real-world moving objects.

2. **YTVIS 2021 Dataset**: This dataset serves as a foundational resource for video instance segmentation and multi-object tracking research, containing 2,985 training videos annotated with high-quality bounding boxes across 40 semantic categories.

To ensure accuracy, I will then refer to the **References section** of the paper to obtain the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **GOT10K Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Huang, L., Zhao, X., Huang, K. (2019). GOT-10K: A large high-diversity benchmark for generic object tracking in the wild. *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*, 43(5), 1562â€“1577.

- For the **YTVIS 2021 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yang, L., Fan, Y., Xu, N. (2022). The 4th Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge - Video Instance Segmentation Track. In *Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
