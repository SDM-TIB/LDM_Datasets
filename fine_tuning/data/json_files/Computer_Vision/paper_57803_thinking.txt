To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalizing Multimodal Variational Methods to Sets" by Charles Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed method on "public datasets of various domains," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors mention the need for multimodal data with fine-grained labeling and alignment, but they do not specify any datasets yet. This indicates that I should continue looking in the subsequent sections.

I will then focus on the **experiments section** (section 4). In **subsection 4.1 (Experiment Settings)**, the authors mention using several datasets, including:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition.
2. **FashionMNIST**: A dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms, consisting of fashion items.
3. **CelebA**: A large-scale face attributes dataset with over 200,000 celebrity images.

In this subsection, the authors describe how they converted these uni-modal datasets into bi-modal datasets by transforming labels into one-hot vectors. This confirms that these datasets are indeed utilized in their experiments.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations I need to retrieve are:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For **FashionMNIST**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. 2017.

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), December 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
