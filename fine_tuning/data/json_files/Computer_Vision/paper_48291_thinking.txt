To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning Models in Software Requirements Engineering" by Maria Naumcheva, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied a sentence autoencoder to a dataset for the sentence generation task, which suggests that a specific dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **method section**, particularly the subsection labeled **Dataset**. Here, the author describes the dataset used for their experiments. The text states that they used a requirements dataset created for the ReqExp project, which was led by Sadovykh A., Ivanov V., and Naumchev A. This dataset was specifically curated from projects with poorly specified requirements and enriched with additional data collected from publicly available software requirements specifications.

The paper mentions that the resulting dataset contains about 3000 entries, with each entry being one sentence. This is a crucial detail as it provides context about the dataset's size and structure.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself, but it does reference the ReqExp project and its contributors. Therefore, I will construct a citation based on the information provided in the text:

- For the **requirements dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sadovykh A., Ivanov V., and Naumchev A. *Requirements Dataset for the ReqExp Project*. Unpublished dataset.

Since the dataset is not formally published, I will note it as unpublished in the citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation and relevant details about the dataset's characteristics. This will be ready for downstream processing or review.
