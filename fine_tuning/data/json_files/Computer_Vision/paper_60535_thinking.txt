To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NaviNeRF: NeRF-based 3D Representation Disentanglement by Latent Semantic Navigation" by Baao Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In the introduction, the authors typically outline the context and significance of their work, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors usually detail the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention evaluating their model on several datasets, specifically:

1. **FFHQ**: This dataset consists of 70,000 high-quality images of human faces.
2. **AFHQ**: This dataset contains 15,000 high-quality images categorized into three classes: cats, dogs, and wildlife.
3. **CompCars**: This dataset includes 136,726 images of cars with various styles.
4. **LSUN**: This dataset comprises approximately one million images across multiple object categories.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

- For **FFHQ**, the citation is:
  > Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. *A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 4401–4410, 2019.

- For **AFHQ**, the citation is:
  > Yunjey Choi, Youngjung Uh, Jaejun Yoo, and Jung-Woo Ha. *Stargan v2: Diverse image synthesis for multiple domains*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 8188–8197, 2020.

- For **CompCars**, the citation is:
  > Linjie Yang, Ping Luo, Chen Change Loy, and Xiaoou Tang. *A large-scale car dataset for fine-grained categorization and verification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 3973–3981, 2015.

- For **LSUN**, the citation is:
  > Fisher Yu, Ari Seff, Yinda Zhang, Shuran Song, Thomas Funkhouser, and Jianxiong Xiao. *LSUN: Construction of a large-scale image dataset using deep learning with humans in the loop*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.03365, 2015.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
