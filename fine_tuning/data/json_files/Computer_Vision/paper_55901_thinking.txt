To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DYNIMP: Dynamic Imputation for Wearable Sensing Data through Sensory and Temporal Relatedness" by Zepeng Huo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of missing data in wearable sensing applications, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction also emphasizes the importance of wearable sensor data but does not name any datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors mention the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly state that they used the **UCSD ExtraSensory dataset**. This section provides a detailed description of the dataset, including the number of users, types of sensors, and inherent missingness.

The authors describe the **UCSD ExtraSensory dataset** as follows:
- It contains data from 60 users (34 female and 26 male).
- Data were collected through users' personal smartphones (34 iPhones and 26 Android devices).
- The sensors include high-frequency motion-reactive sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers.
- The dataset has an inherent missingness of 66% for each sensor.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **UCSD ExtraSensory dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Yonatan Vaizman, Nadir Weibel, and Gert Lanckriet. *Context recognition in-the-wild: Unified model for multi-modal sensors and multi-label classification*. Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies, vol. 1, no. 4, pp. 1â€“22, 2018.

With this information, I have successfully identified the dataset used in the research and its full citation. I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
