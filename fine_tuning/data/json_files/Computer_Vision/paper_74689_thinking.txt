To extract datasets from the research paper titled "E2GS: Event Enhanced Gaussian Splatting" by Hiroyuki Deguchi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention datasets used for experiments. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4.2 (Datasets)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors mention two types of datasets:

1. **Synthetic Data**: This dataset consists of six synthetic scenes (chair, ficus, hotdog, lego, materials, and mic) created using the Camera Shakify plugin in Blender. The event data for this dataset is simulated by V2E. Each scene includes 100 views of blurry images estimated from 17 different camera poses, along with the corresponding event data and camera poses.

2. **Real-world Data**: This dataset includes five challenging scenes (letter, lego, camera, plant, and toys) captured using the DAVIS346 color event camera. Each scene has 30 views of blurry images and their corresponding event data.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

- For the **V2E** dataset, the citation is:
  > Yuhuang Hu, Shih-Chii Liu, and Tobi Delbruck. *V2E: From Video Frames to Realistic DVS Events*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1312–1321, 2021.

- For the **DAVIS346 color event camera**, the citation is:
  > Christian Brandli, Raphael Berner, Minhao Yang, Shih-Chii Liu, and Tobi Delbruck. *A 240× 180 130 dB 3 µs Latency Global Shutter Spatiotemporal Vision Sensor*. IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, vol. 49, no. 10, pp. 2333–2341, 2014.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or citations related to the datasets used in the research.
