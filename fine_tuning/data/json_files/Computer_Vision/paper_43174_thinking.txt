To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Thompson Sampling for Linearly Constrained Bandits" by Vidit Saxena et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "numerical experiments on two real-world datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Coupon-Purchase Dataset**: This dataset contains discount coupons applied to online purchases. The authors specify that they extracted 142 coupons for products priced at or below 200 price units, which have been purchased by at least one customer. They also mention obtaining the purchase rate and the discounted selling price from this dataset.

2. **edX-Course Dataset**: This dataset includes enrollment information for 290 Harvard and MIT courses. The authors describe how they processed this dataset to estimate course participation rates and certification rates.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper cites the following sources for the datasets:

- For the **Coupon-Purchase Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kaggle. *Coupon Purchase Data*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/coupon-purchase-prediction/data.

- For the **edX-Course Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chuang, I. and Ho, A. (2016). *HarvardX and MITx: Four years of open online coursesâ€“fall 2012-summer 2016*. Available at SSRN 2889436.

Now that I have the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.
