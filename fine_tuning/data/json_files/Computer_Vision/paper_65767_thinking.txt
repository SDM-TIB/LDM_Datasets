To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simple Baselines for Projection-Based Full-Reference and No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment" by Zicheng Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of point clouds and quality assessment methods, but it does not specify any datasets. However, the introduction discusses the need for effective methods to quantify distortion in point clouds, which suggests that datasets may be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the **experiments section (3.1)**, the authors mention that they participated in the ICIP 2023 PCVQA Challenge and validated their method on the **BASICS database**. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being used.

I will gather details about the **BASICS database** from the text. The paper states that the BASICS database contains 75 reference point clouds and employs four types of compression methods to generate compressed point clouds. This information is crucial for describing the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the BASICS database. The relevant citation is:
> Ali Ak, Emin Zerman, Maurice Quach, Aladine Chetouani, Aljosa Smolic, Giuseppe Valenzise, and Patrick Le Callet. "BASICS: Broad quality assessment of static point clouds in compression scenarios." arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.04796, 2023.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset:

1. **BASICS Database**: A dataset targeted at the quality assessment of compressed point clouds, containing 75 reference point clouds and employing four types of compression methods.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the full citation for the BASICS database as it is essential for proper referencing.
