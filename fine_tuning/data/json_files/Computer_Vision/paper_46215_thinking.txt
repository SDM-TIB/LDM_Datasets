To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Context-Aware Graph Convolution Network for Target Re-identification" by Deyi Ji et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both person and vehicle re-identification datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **Market-1501**: This dataset consists of 32,668 pedestrian image boxes of 1,501 identities, with a specific breakdown of training and testing images.

2. **DukeMTMC-reID**: This dataset contains 16,522 images of 702 identities, with a similar structure for training and testing images.

3. **VeRi-776**: This dataset includes 49,357 images of 776 distinct vehicles captured from various viewpoints and conditions.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Market-1501**, the citation is:
  > Zheng, L., Shen, L., Tian, L., Wang, S., Wang, J., & Tian, Q. (2015). Scalable Person Re-identification: A Benchmark. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

- For **DukeMTMC-reID**, the citation is:
  > Zheng, Z., Zheng, L., & Yang, Y. (2017). Unlabeled Samples Generated by GAN Improve the Person Re-identification Baseline in Vitro. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

- For **VeRi-776**, the citation is:
  > Liu, X., Liu, W., Mei, T., & Ma, H. (2016). A Deep Learning-Based Approach to Progressive Vehicle Re-identification for Urban Surveillance. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
