To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Completing Visual Objects via Bridging Generation and Segmentation" by Xiang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **AHP Dataset**: This dataset is described as an amodal human perception dataset containing 56,302 images with annotations of integrated humans. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's purpose and scope.

2. **DYCE Dataset**: This is a synthetic dataset with photo-realistic images and natural configurations of objects in indoor scenes. The authors note that for both datasets, the non-occluded object and its corresponding mask for each object are available, which is important for the context of their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **AHP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhou, Q., Wang, S., Wang, Y., Huang, Z., & Wang, X. (2021). Human de-occlusion: Invisible perception and recovery for humans. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 3691–3701.

- For the **DYCE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ehsani, K., Mottaghi, R., & Farhadi, A. (2018). Segan: Segmenting and generating the invisible. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 1–10.

Now that I have the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
