To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards the Automatic Anime Characters Creation with Generative Adversarial Networks" by Yanghua Jin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected a "clean, well-suited dataset" for training their GAN models, which suggests that a specific dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Image Data Preparation)**, where the authors describe their dataset collection process. They mention using images from **Getchu**, a website that provides information and sells Japanese games. This section details how they collected images, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's origin.

In **section 3.1 (Image Collection)**, the authors explain their method for gathering images from Getchu, emphasizing the quality and consistency of the images collected. They mention that they ended up with a total of **42,000 face images**, which were manually checked to remove false positives.

Additionally, in **section 3.2 (Tag Estimation)**, the authors discuss the use of a pre-trained model to estimate tags for the images, which adds another layer of detail about the dataset's structure.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is derived from Getchu, I will note that the citation for the website is as follows:

- **Getchu**: 
  > Getchu. *Getchu: Information and Sales of Japanese Games*. Available at: http://www.getchu.com/

Since the dataset is based on images collected from this website, I will use this citation to represent the dataset.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation as required. The dataset is primarily composed of anime character images collected from Getchu, with a total of 42,000 images, which were processed and tagged for use in the GAN model.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing.
