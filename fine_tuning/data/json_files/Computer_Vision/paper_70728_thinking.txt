To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WIA-LD2ND: Wavelet-based Image Alignment for Self-supervised Low-Dose CT Denoising" by Haoyu Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two public LDCT denoising datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. They state that they conducted experiments on two public LDCT denoising datasets: **Mayo-2016** and **Mayo-2020**. I will note the details provided about these datasets, including the number of image pairs used for training and testing.

In section 3.1, the authors provide specific information about the datasets:
1. **Mayo-2016 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 5410 image pairs (512×512) from 9 patients, with a specific reconstruction parameter combination used for training and testing.
2. **Mayo-2020 Dataset**: This dataset includes 2082 pairs (512×512) from 12 patients for training, with 672 pairs from 4 patients for testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Mayo-2016 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > McCollough, C. H., Bartley, A. C., Carter, R. E., Chen, B., Drees, T. A., Edwards, P., Holmes III, D. R., Huang, A. E., Khan, F., Leng, S., et al. (2017). Low-dose CT for the detection and classification of metastatic liver lesions: results of the 2016 low dose CT grand challenge. *Medical Physics*, 44(10), e339–e352.

- For the **Mayo-2020 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Moen, T. R., Chen, B., Holmes III, D. R., Duan, X., Yu, Z., Yu, L., Leng, S., Fletcher, J. G., & McCollough, C. H. (2021). Low-dose CT image and projection dataset. *Medical Physics*, 48(2), 902–911.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
