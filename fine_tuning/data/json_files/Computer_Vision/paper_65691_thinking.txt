To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reliable Generation of Privacy-preserving Synthetic EHR Time Series via Diffusion Models" by Muhang Tian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on several databases, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods** section, specifically the **Datasets** subsection. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention four publicly available EHR datasets:

1. **MIMIC-III**: A critical care database containing EHR data for patients admitted to intensive care units.
2. **MIMIC-IV**: An updated version of MIMIC-III, containing more recent medical data.
3. **eICU Collaborative Research Database**: A multi-center database with admissions to intensive care units across the U.S.
4. **Stocks and Energy datasets**: Non-EHR datasets used for comparison.

In this section, I will also look for any specific details about the datasets, such as sample sizes, features, and any preprocessing steps mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the EHR datasets are as follows:

- **MIMIC-III**:
  > Johnson, A. E. et al. MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database. *Scientific Data* 3, 1–9 (2016).

- **MIMIC-IV**:
  > Johnson, A. E. W. et al. MIMIC-IV, a freely accessible electronic health record dataset. *Scientific Data* 10, Article no. 1 (2023).

- **eICU Collaborative Research Database**:
  > Pollard, T. J. et al. The eICU Collaborative Research Database, a freely available multi-center database for critical care research. *Scientific Data* 5, 1–13 (2018).

For the **Stocks** and **Energy datasets**, the paper mentions that they are available online but does not provide specific citations. I will note that these datasets can be accessed from their respective sources, such as Yahoo Finance for Stocks and the UCI Machine Learning Repository for Energy.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified and properly referenced.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
