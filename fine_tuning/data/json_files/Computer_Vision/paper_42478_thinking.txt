To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Controllable Level Blending between Games using Variational Autoencoders" by Anurag Sarkar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) on level data from **Super Mario Bros.** and **Kid Icarus**, which suggests that these games are the primary datasets of interest.

Next, I will focus on the **Approach section**, specifically where the authors describe the dataset used for training the VAE. They mention that the level data was taken from the **Video Game Level Corpus (VGLC)**, which is a significant dataset for their research. The authors specify that they used one level from each game: **Level 1-1 from Super Mario Bros.** and **Level 5 from Kid Icarus**.

In the **Dataset subsection**, they provide details about the data collection process, including the number of segments extracted from each level. They mention obtaining **187 segments from Super Mario Bros.** and **191 segments from Kid Icarus**, totaling **378 training segments**. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Video Game Level Corpus (VGLC). The citation provided in the paper is:
> Summerville, A. J., Snodgrass, S., Mateas, M., & Onta˜n´on, S. (2016). The VGLC: The Video Game Level Corpus. Proceedings of the 7th Workshop on Procedural Content Generation.

Additionally, I will note that while the authors used specific levels from the games, the original games themselves are not typically cited as datasets in the same way as the VGLC. However, I will still mention them for completeness.

The final step is to compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as follows:

1. **Video Game Level Corpus (VGLC)**:
   > Summerville, A. J., Snodgrass, S., Mateas, M., & Onta˜n´on, S. (2016). The VGLC: The Video Game Level Corpus. Proceedings of the 7th Workshop on Procedural Content Generation.

2. **Super Mario Bros. Level 1-1**:
   - This level is part of the VGLC dataset and does not have a separate citation since it is a level from the game itself.

3. **Kid Icarus Level 5**:
   - Similar to Super Mario Bros., this level is also part of the VGLC dataset and does not have a separate citation.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare to format it according to the required structure for downstream processing.
