To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GeoWizard: Unleashing the Diffusion Priors for 3D Geometry Estimation from a Single Image" by Xiao Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the limitations of publicly available datasets and hints at the need for diverse and high-quality datasets for geometry estimation. This suggests that the authors likely reference specific datasets later in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Implementation Details and Datasets)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training their model. Here, they mention three categories of datasets:

1. **Indoor Datasets**:
   - **HyperSim**: A photorealistic synthetic dataset with 461 indoor scenes, filtered down to 25,463 samples.
   - **Replica**: A dataset of high-quality reconstructions of 18 indoor spaces, yielding 50,884 samples after filtering.

2. **Outdoor Datasets**:
   - **3D Ken Burns**: A large-scale synthetic dataset with 76,048 stereo pairs in 23 in-the-wild scenes.
   - Additional synthetic city samples from their own simulation platform.

3. **Background-free Object Dataset**:
   - **Objaverse**: A massive dataset of over 10 million 3D objects, filtered to 85,997 high-quality objects for training.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **HyperSim**, the citation is:
  > Roberts, M., Ramapuram, J., Ranjan, A., Kumar, A., Bautista, M.A., Paczan, N., Webb, R., Susskind, J.M. *Hypersim: A photorealistic synthetic dataset for holistic indoor scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021.

- For **Replica**, the citation is:
  > Straub, J., Whelan, T., Ma, L., Chen, Y., Wijmans, E., Green, S., Engel, J.J., Mur-Artal, R., Ren, C., Verma, S., et al. *The Replica Dataset: A Digital Replica of Indoor Spaces*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.05724, 2019.

- For **3D Ken Burns**, the citation is:
  > Niklaus, S., Mai, L., Yang, J., Liu, F. *3D Ken Burns Effect from a Single Image*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 2019.

- For **Objaverse**, the citation is:
  > Deitke, M., Schwenk, D., Salvador, J., Weihs, L., Michel, O., VanderBilt, E., Schmidt, L., Ehsani, K., Kembhavi, A., Farhadi, A. *Objaverse: A Universe of Annotated 3D Objects*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research in the field.
