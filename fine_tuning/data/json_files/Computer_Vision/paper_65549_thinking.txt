To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STANLEY: Stochastic Gradient Anisotropic Langevin Dynamics for Learning Energy-Based Models" by Belhal Karimi, Jianwen Xie, and Ping Li, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in the context of image generation experiments. Specifically, I will look for sections that describe the datasets used for training and evaluation.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention three datasets:

1. **Oxford Flowers 102 Dataset**: This dataset is used for image generation tasks and consists of images of flowers with variations in scale, pose, and lighting.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: A well-known dataset in computer vision, CIFAR-10 contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images across 10 different classes of objects.

3. **CelebA Dataset**: This dataset contains over 200,000 RGB color facial images and is used for image inpainting experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Oxford Flowers 102 Dataset**:
  > Maria-Elena Nilsback and Andrew Zisserman. *Automated flower classification over a large number of classes*. In Proceedings of the Sixth Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics & Image Processing (ICVGIP), pages 722–729, Bhubaneswar, India, 2008.

- **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical Report, University of Toronto, 2009.

- **CelebA Dataset**:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3730–3738, Santiago, Chile, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation for proper referencing.
