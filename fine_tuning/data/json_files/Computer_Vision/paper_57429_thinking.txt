To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spectral Feature Augmentation for Graph Contrastive Learning and Beyond" by Yifei Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on various datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific dataset names and descriptions.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing Section 4, I find that the authors mention five datasets used for their experiments: **Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed, Amazon-Computers, and Amazon-Photo**. Each dataset is described in terms of its type, number of nodes, edges, attributes, and classes.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper. This is crucial as it provides the authoritative source for each dataset. 

Here are the citations I will extract:

1. **Cora Dataset**:
   > Kipf, T. N., & Welling, M. (2016). Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.02907*.

2. **CiteSeer Dataset**:
   > Kipf, T. N., & Welling, M. (2016). Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.02907*.

3. **PubMed Dataset**:
   > Kipf, T. N., & Welling, M. (2016). Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.02907*.

4. **Amazon-Computers Dataset**:
   > McAuley, J. J., Targett, C., Shi, Q., & van den Hengel, A. (2015). Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes. In *Proceedings of the 38th international ACM SIGIR conference on research and development in information retrieval* (pp. 43-52).

5. **Amazon-Photo Dataset**:
   > McAuley, J. J., Targett, C., Shi, Q., & van den Hengel, A. (2015). Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes. In *Proceedings of the 38th international ACM SIGIR conference on research and development in information retrieval* (pp. 43-52).

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and its citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details for future reference or analysis.
