To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Generalized Zero-Shot Learners for Open-Domain Image Geolocalization" by Lukas Haas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the introduction of "StreetCLIP," a model trained on a dataset of 1.1 million Street View images, which indicates that this dataset is significant for the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.2 (A Planet-Scale Image Geolocalization Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset they created. They mention collecting 275,000 coordinate pairs from Geoguessr, resulting in a total of 1.1 million Google Street View images. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including its size and source.

In addition, I will check the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used for evaluation. The authors mention two benchmark datasets: **IM2GPS** and **IM2GPS3K**. I will gather details about these datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Street View Dataset** (original dataset created by the authors):
   - The citation for this dataset is not explicitly provided in the references, as it is an original dataset collected by the authors. However, I will note that it consists of 1.1 million images sourced from Google Street View.

2. **IM2GPS Dataset**:
   > Hays, J., & Efros, A. A. (2008). IM2GPS: estimating geographic information from a single image. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 1–8.

3. **IM2GPS3K Dataset**:
   > Vo, N., Jacobs, N., & Hays, J. (2017). Revisiting IM2GPS in the deep learning era. In 2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 2640–2649.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that full citations are included for the benchmark datasets. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any critical details and that the citations are correctly formatted for future reference.
