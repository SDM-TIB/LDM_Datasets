To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Local Similarity Pattern and Cost Self-Reassembling for Deep Stereo Matching Networks" by Biyang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated on **SceneFlow and KITTI benchmarks**, which suggests that these datasets are used in the experiments.

Next, I will look specifically in the **Experiments section**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. They mention:

1. **SceneFlow**: This is a synthetic dataset containing 35,454 training pairs and 4,370 testing pairs, both with dense ground truth. The evaluation metrics used for SceneFlow are End Point Error (EPE) and 1-pixel error.

2. **KITTI**: The authors refer to two subsets of the KITTI dataset: KITTI 2012 and KITTI 2015. KITTI 2012 consists of 194 training pairs and 195 testing pairs, while KITTI 2015 has 200 training pairs and 200 testing pairs. The evaluation metrics for KITTI include EPE and D1 error.

In the **References section**, I will find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SceneFlow**, the citation is:
  > Mayer, N., Ilg, E., Hausser, P., Fischer, P., Cremers, D., Dosovitskiy, A., & Brox, T. (2016). A large dataset to train convolutional networks for disparity, optical flow, and scene flow estimation. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 4040–4048.

- For **KITTI**, the citations are:
  > Geiger, A., Lenz, P., & Urtasun, R. (2012). Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite. In 2012 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 3354–3361.
  
  > Menze, M., & Geiger, A. (2015). Object scene flow for autonomous vehicles. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 3061–3070.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
