To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Botnet Detection with Recurrent Neural Network and Transfer Learning" by Jeeyung Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a semi-supervised learning method and mentions the CTU-13 dataset, which is a well-known dataset in botnet detection research.

Next, I will look into **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **CTU-13 Dataset**: This dataset is widely used in botnet detection studies and consists of various botnet scenarios. The authors note that it includes thirteen scenarios designed to represent different malware behaviors.

2. **Dataset K**: This is a network monitoring dataset collected from a Zeek server, which is used as a target domain for testing their transfer learning framework. The authors mention that this dataset is not labeled.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about how they utilize the CTU-13 dataset for evaluating their RVAE model and how they apply transfer learning using dataset K.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **CTU-13 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Garcia, S., Grill, M., Stiborek, J., & Zunino, A. (2014). An empirical comparison of botnet detection methods. *Computers & Security*, 45, 100-123.

- For **Dataset K**, since it is a dataset collected from a Zeek server and does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset used in their experiments.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
