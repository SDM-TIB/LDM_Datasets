To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comprehensive Survey on Generative Diffusion Models for Structured Data," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include mentions of specific datasets.

Next, I will look for sections that explicitly discuss datasets, such as **section 3 (Data-driven General Tasks)** and **section 4 (Domain-specific Applications)**. These sections are likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in various studies related to generative diffusion models.

In **section 3**, the authors categorize the datasets into two main types: **tabular data** and **time series data**. I will carefully read through the subsections under this section to identify any datasets mentioned. For example, the paper lists several works that utilize specific datasets for tasks like generation and imputation.

In **section 4**, which focuses on domain-specific applications, I will look for datasets related to **Electronic Health Records (EHR)**, **bioelectrical signal processing**, and **recommendation systems**. Each subsection may provide insights into the datasets used in those specific contexts.

As I identify datasets, I will take note of their names and any relevant details provided in the text. For instance, the paper mentions datasets like **MIMIC-III** and **PTB-XL** in the context of EHR, and **MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test Database** for bioelectrical signals.

After gathering the dataset names, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the paper mentions the **MIMIC-III** dataset, I will look for its citation in the references, which typically includes the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have compiled the dataset names along with their full citations, I will organize this information clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its corresponding citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for any required output format, ensuring that all information is complete and ready for review or further processing.
