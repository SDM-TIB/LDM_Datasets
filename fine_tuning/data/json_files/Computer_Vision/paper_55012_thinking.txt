To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Boosting Video-Text Retrieval with Explicit High-Level Semantics" by Di Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the method achieves superior performance on three benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **MSR-VTT**: This dataset contains 10,000 videos from YouTube, each annotated with five captions. The authors follow the 1k-A protocol for their experiments.

2. **MSVD**: This dataset includes 1,970 videos with approximately 80,000 captions, split into training, validation, and testing sets.

3. **DiDeMo**: This dataset consists of 10,000 videos, each annotated with 40 sentences, and is used for video-paragraph retrieval.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that these datasets are utilized for evaluating their proposed method, which reinforces the importance of these datasets in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MSR-VTT**, the citation is:
  > Jun Xu, Tao Mei, Ting Yao, and Yong Rui. *MSR-VTT: A Large Video Description Dataset for Bridging Video and Language*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 5288–5296, 2016.

- For **MSVD**, the citation is:
  > David Chen and William B Dolan. *Collecting Highly Parallel Data for Paraphrase Evaluation*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 190–200, 2011.

- For **DiDeMo**, the citation is:
  > Lisa Anne Hendricks, Oliver Wang, Eli Shechtman, Josef Sivic, Trevor Darrell, and Bryan Russell. *Localizing Moments in Video with Natural Language*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 5803–5812, 2017.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any critical details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
