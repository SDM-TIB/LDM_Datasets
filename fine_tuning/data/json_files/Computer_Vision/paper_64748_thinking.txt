To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Physics Inspired Hybrid Attention for SAR Target Recognition" by Zhongling Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **MSTAR dataset** for evaluation, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors describe their experimental setup. In **Section 4.1**, they mention that their experiments are primarily conducted on the **MSTAR dataset**. This section provides details about the dataset, including its characteristics and how it is used in their evaluation protocol.

In **Section 4.1.1**, the authors describe the **Once for All (OFA) evaluation protocol** and provide context about the MSTAR dataset, including its origin and the types of data it contains. They specify that the MSTAR dataset is collected by Sandia National Laboratory’s SAR sensor and consists of various military vehicles with different orientations and depression angles.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MSTAR dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Sandia National Laboratory. (Accessed May 2023) ’The Air Force Moving and Stationary Target Recognition Database’. [Online]. Available: https://www.sdms.afrl.af.mil/index.php?collection=mstar

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **MSTAR Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed method in the context of SAR target recognition. It includes various types of military vehicles and is essential for assessing the robustness and generalization capabilities of the proposed approach.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included as it is crucial for proper referencing.
