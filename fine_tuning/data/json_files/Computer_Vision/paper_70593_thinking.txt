To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HeadEvolver: Text to Head Avatars via Locally Learnable Mesh Deformation" by Duotun Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for training or evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context of the research and may reference specific datasets that are relevant to the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, size, and purpose in the context of the research.

In this paper, I will specifically look for any datasets that are used for training the model or for evaluation purposes. If the authors mention any datasets, I will take note of their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "FLAME" or "3DMMs," I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets to ensure I have the correct citations. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and structured manner, ready for any further processing or presentation.
