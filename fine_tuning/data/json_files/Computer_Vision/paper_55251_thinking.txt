To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Nearest Convolution for Real-Time Efficient Image Super-Resolution" by Ziwei Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on the **DIV2K 3× dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.1 (Dataset and Implementation Details)**, where the authors provide specific details about the dataset used. They mention using the **DIV2K dataset** for training and testing, specifying that it consists of 800 image pairs for training and 100 image pairs for testing. This section confirms the dataset's role in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DIV2K dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Agustsson, E., Timofte, R. (2017). *Ntire 2017 challenge on single image super-resolution: Dataset and study*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition workshops, pp. 126–135.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the DIV2K dataset, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper attribution. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
