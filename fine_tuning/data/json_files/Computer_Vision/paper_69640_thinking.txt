To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Make a Cheap Scaling: A Self-Cascade Diffusion Model for Higher-Resolution Adaptation" by Lanqing Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention key datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Laion-5B**: This dataset is referenced in the context of image generation experiments. It contains 5 billion image-caption pairs and is used to evaluate the quality and diversity of generated images.

2. **Webvid-10M**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of video generation experiments. It consists of 10 million high-resolution videos and is used to assess the performance of the proposed method in generating videos.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For **Laion-5B**, the citation is:
> Christoph Schuhmann, Romain Beaumont, Richard Vencu, Cade Gordon, Ross Wightman, Mehdi Cherti, Theo Coombes, Aarush Katta, Clayton Mullis, Mitchell Wortsman, Patrick Schramowski, Srivatsa Kundurthy, Katherine Crowson, Ludwig Schmidt, Robert Kaczmarczyk, and Jenia Jitsev. *Laion-5B: An open large-scale dataset for training next generation image-text models*, 2022.

For **Webvid-10M**, the citation is:
> Max Bain, Arsha Nagrani, Gül Varol, and Andrew Zisserman. *Frozen in time: A joint video and image encoder for end-to-end retrieval*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 1728–1738, 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as presented in the research paper.
