To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Building Optimal Neural Architectures using Interpretable Knowledge" by Keith G. Mills et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments on state-of-the-art image classification, segmentation, and Stable Diffusion models, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** and **results** sections. In the methodology, the authors describe their experiments and the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will pay close attention to any explicit dataset names or references.

Upon reviewing the **results section**, I find that the authors mention using the **ImageNet** dataset for training their models. They also refer to the **MS-COCO** dataset for panoptic segmentation tasks. These are significant datasets in the field of computer vision.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper documentation. 

1. For the **ImageNet** dataset, the citation is:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

2. For the **MS-COCO** dataset, the citation is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, Lubomir Bourdev, Ross Girshick, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, C. Lawrence Zitnick, and Piotr Dollar. *Microsoft coco: Common objects in context*. In Computer Vision – ECCV 2014, pages 740–755. Springer International Publishing, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
