To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How Good Are Variational Autoencoders at Transfer Learning?" by Lisa Bonheme and Marek Grzes, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **Datasets section** (Section 3) where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details about their use in the experiments.

From the text, I note that the authors mention using several datasets, including:

1. **dSprites**: A dataset used for evaluating the performance of VAEs, which is known for its simplicity and controlled variability.
2. **Cars3D**: Another dataset mentioned for its complexity in terms of reconstruction loss.
3. **SmallNorb**: A dataset that presents additional challenges for VAEs.
4. **Symsol_reduced**: A dataset introduced by the authors for their specific experiments.
5. **Celeba**: A well-known dataset used for facial attribute recognition.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The citations I will extract are as follows:

- **dSprites**: 
  > Higgins, I., Matthey, L., Pal, A., Burgess, C., Glorot, X., Botvinick, M., Shakir, E., & Lerchner, A. (2017). *Î²-VAE: Learning Basic Visual Concepts with a Constrained Variational Framework*. In International Conference on Learning Representations.

- **Cars3D**: 
  > Reed, S., Zhang, Y., Zhang, Y., & Lee, H. (2015). *Deep Visual Analogy-Making*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems.

- **SmallNorb**: 
  > LeCun, Y., Huang, F. J., & Bottou, L. (2004). *Learning Methods for Generic Object Recognition with Invariance to Pose and Lighting*. In Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.

- **Symsol_reduced**: 
  > Bonheme, L., & Grzes, M. (2022). *Fondue: An Algorithm to Find the Optimal Dimensionality of the Latent Representations of Variational Autoencoders*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2209.12806.

- **Celeba**: 
  > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset used in the research paper.
