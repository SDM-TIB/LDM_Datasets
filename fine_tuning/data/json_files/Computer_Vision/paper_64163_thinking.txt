To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mapping EEG Signals to Visual Stimuli: A Deep Learning Approach to Match vs. Mismatch Classification" by Yiqian Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used an "exclusive experimental dataset," which suggests that there is a specific dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their data collection process. They mention that they developed a comprehensive database consisting of 64-channel EEG recordings from 100 participants while watching a 3.5-minute Chinese movie clip. This is a crucial detail as it outlines the dataset's context.

In the **methods section**, the authors provide further details about the EEG data collection, including the sampling frequency (1000 Hz) and the video resolution (1080p). They also mention that the dataset is available for research use upon request, which is important for understanding its accessibility.

The authors specify that they used a subset of this dataset for evaluation, which includes 56 subjects. This subset is critical for understanding the specific data used in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset in the **references section**. However, the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself, as it appears to be a custom dataset created by the authors. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is not publicly cited in a standard format.

To summarize, I will extract the following information about the dataset:

1. **Dataset Name**: EEG Dataset from Movie Clips
   - **Description**: A dataset consisting of 64-channel EEG recordings from 100 participants while watching a 3.5-minute Chinese movie clip. The dataset includes EEG signals sampled at 1000 Hz and video clips at 1080p resolution. A subset of 56 subjects was used for evaluation.
   - **Citation**: Not formally cited; dataset is available upon request from the authors.

After gathering this information, I will compile it into a structured format for further processing or review.
