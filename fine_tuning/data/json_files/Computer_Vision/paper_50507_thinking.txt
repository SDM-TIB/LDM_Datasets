To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Does Data Repair Lead to Fair Models? Curating Contextually Fair Data To Reduce Model Bias" by Sharat Agarwal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of existing datasets like COCO and OpenImages for validating the proposed methods. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experimental setup section** (Section 4) to identify specific datasets used in the experiments. The authors explicitly mention using the **COCO dataset** and **OpenImages** for object detection tasks. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their purpose and any specific subsets or annotations mentioned.

In the **experiments section**, the authors also refer to other datasets like **ObjectNet** and **Dollar Street** for cross-dataset evaluations. I will ensure to include these datasets as they are relevant to the context of the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

The citations I will look for include:

1. **COCO Dataset**:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755, Springer, 2014.

2. **OpenImages Dataset**:
   > Alina Kuznetsova, Hassan Rom, Neil Alldrin, Jasper Uijlings, Ivan Krasin, Jordi Pont-Tuset, Shahab Kamali, Stefan Popov, Matteo Malloci, Alexander Kolesnikov, et al. *The Open Images Dataset V4*. International Journal of Computer Vision, pages 1–26, 2020.

3. **ObjectNet Dataset**:
   > Ali Borji. *ObjectNet Dataset: Reanalysis and Correction*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.02042, 2020.

4. **Dollar Street Dataset**:
   > Gapminder. *Dollar Street*. Available at: https://www.gapminder.org/dollar-street.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
