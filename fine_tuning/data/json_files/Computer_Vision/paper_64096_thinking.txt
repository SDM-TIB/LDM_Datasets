To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Segmentation of 3D pore space from CT images using curvilinear skeleton: application to numerical simulation of microbial decomposition" by Olivier Monga et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for validation.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Data sets)**, which is explicitly dedicated to describing the datasets used in the study. This section typically contains detailed information about each dataset, including the type of data, the source, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention using three datasets:

1. **Dataset from Monga et al. (2022) and Mbe et al. (2022)**: This dataset consists of sandy loam soil from the Bullion Field, James Hutton Institute, Invergowrie, Scotland. The CT images have a size of 512 × 512 × 512 with a resolution of 24μm × 24μm × 24μm, resulting in 22,720,090 voxels representing 17% of the whole volume.

2. **Dataset from Monga et al. (2014)**: This dataset consists of quartz sand from the Fontainebleau forest. It includes two CT images corresponding to high and low porosity, both with a size of 512 × 512 × 512 and a resolution of 4.5μm × 4.5μm × 4.5μm.

3. **Additional datasets**: The authors also refer to the datasets used in Monga et al. (2014) and Mbe et al. (2022) for validation of their method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the dataset from Monga et al. (2022):

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset descriptions and their citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
