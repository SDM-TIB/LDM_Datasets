To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exposition and Interpretation of the Topology of Neural Networks" by Rickard BrÃ¼l Gabrielsson and Gunnar Carlsson, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions training over a thousand CNNs on **MNIST, CIFAR-10, SVHN, and ImageNet**, which indicates that these datasets are used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about each dataset in the **experiments section**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the importance of understanding CNNs and mention the datasets used for training and evaluation. 

In the **experiments section**, I will find detailed descriptions of each dataset:

1. **MNIST**: This dataset consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits, with 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples. The authors refer to it multiple times, indicating its significance in their experiments.

2. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset contains natural color images across 10 classes, with 50,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples. The authors describe preprocessing steps taken for this dataset.

3. **SVHN (Street View House Numbers)**: This dataset consists of images of house numbers, which are more diverse than MNIST. The authors mention using this dataset to evaluate generalization capabilities.

4. **ImageNet**: This is a large-scale dataset containing a wide variety of natural images. The authors indicate that CNNs have achieved high accuracy on this dataset, suggesting its importance in their analysis.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Y. LeCun. The MNIST database of handwritten digits. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > A. Krizhevsky. (2009) Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Technical report, University of Toronto.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, Andrew Y. Ng. (2011) Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning. NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L.-J. Li, K. Li, and L. FeiFei. (2009) Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
