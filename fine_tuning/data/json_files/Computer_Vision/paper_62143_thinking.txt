To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vacant Holes for Unsupervised Detection of the Outliers in Compact Latent Representation" by Misha Glazunov and Apostolis Zarras, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference datasets that are relevant to their research. I will look for phrases that indicate the use of specific datasets or benchmarks.

In the **methodology section**, I will pay close attention to any subsections that describe the experimental setup. This is typically where authors detail the datasets they used, including any preprocessing steps or specific characteristics of the datasets.

I will also check the **experiments section** for any results that reference datasets. Authors often summarize their findings in relation to specific datasets, which can help confirm the datasets used in their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset**, I would look for the citation:
> Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, 2010.

If they mention another dataset, such as **Fashion-MNIST**, I would find its citation:
> Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: a novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, providing complete citations for each one.
