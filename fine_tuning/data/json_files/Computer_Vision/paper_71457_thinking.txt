To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MosquitoFusion: A Multiclass Dataset for Real-Time Detection of Mosquitoes, Swarms, and Breeding Sites Using Deep Learning" by Md. Faiyaz Abdullah Sayeedi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract states that the authors present a multiclass dataset called **MosquitoFusion** containing 1204 diverse images. This indicates that there is a dataset to extract.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the dataset. The introduction emphasizes the importance of the MosquitoFusion dataset in the context of mosquito-borne diseases and mentions its use in training a YOLOv8 model. This reinforces the significance of the dataset.

I will then look into the **methodology section**, specifically **section 3.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the MosquitoFusion dataset. They describe it as comprising 1204 curated images divided into training (87%), validation (8%), and test (5%) sets. The section also mentions the rigorous preprocessing and augmentation techniques applied to enhance the dataset's diversity.

In the **results analysis** section, the authors discuss the performance of the model trained on the MosquitoFusion dataset, further confirming its utility and relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MosquitoFusion dataset. However, since the dataset is created by the authors themselves, it may not have a separate citation. Instead, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Md. Faiyaz Abdullah Sayeedi, Fahim Hafiz, and Md Ashiqur Rahman. *MosquitoFusion: A Multiclass Dataset for Real-Time Detection of Mosquitoes, Swarms, and Breeding Sites Using Deep Learning*. In Proceedings of the ICLR 2024 Tiny Papers Track.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset details and prepare to format them according to the required structure. The MosquitoFusion dataset is the primary dataset extracted from this paper, and I will ensure to include its citation in the final output.
