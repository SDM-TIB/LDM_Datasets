To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explaining Black Boxes on Sequential Data using Weighted Automata" by Stéphane Ayache et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments using "48 synthetic datasets and 2 real datasets," which indicates that there are multiple datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 5.1 (Synthetic Data), the authors mention the use of "48 instances of the PAutomaC learning competition," which provides a clear reference to a specific dataset. They describe this dataset as containing strings generated by a stochastic synthetic machine, which is crucial information.

In section 5.2 (Real Data), the authors specify two real-world datasets:
1. **Penn Treebank**: This dataset contains English verbs at the character level and consists of 5,987 learning examples on 33 different symbols. It is referenced as problem 4 of the SPiCe competition.
2. **Fuel Consumption Dataset**: This dataset consists of discretized sensor signals of fuel consumption in trucks, containing 20,000 strings on an alphabet of size 18. It is referenced as PAutomaC Natural problem 2.

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. 

For the **PAutomaC learning competition**, the citation is:
> Verwer, R., Eyraud, R., & de la Higuera, C. (2014). PAutomaC: a probabilistic automata and hidden Markov models learning competition. *Machine Learning*, 96(1-2), 129–154.

For the **Penn Treebank**, the citation is:
> Marcus, M. P., Santorini, B., & Marcinkiewicz, M. A. (1994). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313–330.

For the **Fuel Consumption Dataset**, the citation is:
> Verwer, R., de Weerdt, M., & Witteveen, C. (2011). Learning driving behavior by timed syntactic pattern recognition. In *Proceedings of the 22nd International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence* (pp. 1529–1534).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
