To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards a Taxonomy of Large Language Model based Business Model Transformations" by Jochen Wulf and JÃ¼rg Meierhofer, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to look for specific references to datasets in the body of the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the empirical examination of LLMs at the firm level and mention a study that identifies 50 real-world use cases. This suggests that there may be a dataset related to these use cases, but I need to find more details.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their data collection approach. They mention using a specific search term to identify use cases and that they collected a total of 50 use cases. However, they do not provide a detailed dataset name or a direct link to a dataset, which is crucial for citation.

In the **results section**, the authors categorize the use cases into archetypes and discuss their findings, but again, they do not explicitly name a dataset. They mention the distribution of industry sectors and company sizes, but these are more about the analysis rather than specific datasets.

Finally, I will check the **references section** for any citations that might refer to datasets or studies that include datasets. However, the references primarily cite articles and reports that discuss the impact of LLMs and do not seem to provide specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets with full citations, I will note that the only dataset-like information provided is the collection of 50 use cases, which the authors indicate can be provided upon request. This means I cannot provide full citations for datasets as they are not formally listed in the paper.

In conclusion, while I have identified the existence of a collection of use cases, I cannot extract specific datasets with full citations from this paper as they are not explicitly provided. I will summarize my findings and note the lack of formal dataset citations.
