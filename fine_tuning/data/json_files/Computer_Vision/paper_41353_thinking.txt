To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spot Evasion Attacks: Adversarial Examples for License Plate Recognition Systems with Convolutional Neural Networks" by Qian Ya-guan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training or testing.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Evaluation)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in experiments. Here, the authors mention that they collected license plate character images through mobile phone cameras and public sources, resulting in a dataset of **2,300 license plate character images**. This dataset is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

I will also note the specific details provided about the dataset, such as the size of the images (35 × 60 pixels) and the number of images for specific characters (about 380 images of characters 'A' to 'F'). This information is essential for accurately describing the dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets. However, in this case, the authors do not provide a formal citation for the dataset they created, as it appears to be a custom dataset compiled for their research.

Now, I will summarize the findings for the dataset:

1. **License Plate Character Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,300 images of license plate characters, collected from mobile phone cameras and public sources. The images are of size 35 × 60 pixels, and there are approximately 380 images for characters 'A' to 'F'.

Since there are no formal citations for this dataset, I will note that it is a custom dataset created by the authors for the purpose of their experiments.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that the dataset details are accurately captured and can be easily accessed later.
