To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Language Knowledge-Assisted Representation Learning for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition" by Haojun Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **NTU RGB+D**: This dataset contains 56,880 skeleton action sequences across 60 classes, captured using three Microsoft Kinect v2 cameras. The authors provide details about the evaluation schemes, including cross-subject and cross-view splits.

2. **NTU RGB+D 120**: An extension of the NTU RGB+D dataset, this one includes 120 classes and 114,480 skeleton sequences. The authors describe the data acquisition process and the evaluation benchmarks used.

3. **NW-UCLA**: This dataset consists of 1,494 video clips of ten basic human actions performed by ten actors, captured using three Kinect cameras. The authors mention the training and testing protocols for this dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **NTU RGB+D**, the citation is:
  > A. Shahroudy, J. Liu, T. Ng, and G. Wang. "NTU RGB+D: A large scale dataset for 3D human activity analysis." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 1010–1019, 2016.

- For **NTU RGB+D 120**, the citation is:
  > J. Liu, A. Shahroudy, M. Perez, G. Wang, L.-Y. Duan, and A. C. Kot. "NTU RGB+D 120: A large-scale benchmark for 3D human activity understanding." IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 42, no. 10, pp. 2684–2701, 2020.

- For **NW-UCLA**, the citation is:
  > J. Wang, X. Nie, Y. Xia, Y. Wu, and S. Zhu. "Cross-view action modeling, learning, and recognition." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 2649–2656, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
