To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CoVeR: Learning Covariate-Specific Vector Representations with Tensor Decompositions" by Kevin Tian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Dataset)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors describe two primary datasets:

1. **Book Dataset**: This dataset consists of the full text from 29 books written by 4 different authors, including J.K. Rowling, C.S. Lewis, George R. R. Martin, and Stephenie Meyer. The authors explain the composition of the dataset and the rationale behind its selection.

2. **Politics Dataset**: This dataset is a collection of comments made in 2016 from 6 different subreddits on Reddit, chosen to address specific research questions. The authors detail the subreddits included and the characteristics of the vocabulary used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the datasets are original works created by the authors for their experiments, so I will not find external citations for them. Instead, I will summarize the datasets based on the information provided in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the names, descriptions, and any relevant details about the datasets, along with the authors' names and the year of publication.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately captured and formatted correctly.
