To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning Based on Evolutional Representation Learning" by Zixuan Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that their experiments demonstrate substantial performance improvements on six benchmark datasets. This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, prompting me to look for their specific names.

Next, I will navigate to the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets as follows:

1. **ICEWS18**: This dataset is part of the Integrated Crisis Early Warning System and contains event data for temporal reasoning tasks.
2. **ICEWS14**: Another dataset from the Integrated Crisis Early Warning System, used for similar tasks.
3. **ICEWS05-15**: A longer time span dataset from the same source, also utilized in the experiments.
4. **WIKI**: A dataset that includes knowledge graph data for temporal reasoning.
5. **YAGO**: A well-known knowledge graph dataset that is also used in the experiments.
6. **GDELT**: The Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone, which provides extensive event data.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **ICEWS18**: 
  > Elizabeth Boschee, Jennifer Lautenschlager, Sean O’Brien, Steve Shellman, James Starz, and Michael Ward. *ICEWS coded event data*. Harvard Dataverse, 2015.

- **ICEWS14**: 
  > Elizabeth Boschee, Jennifer Lautenschlager, Sean O’Brien, Steve Shellman, James Starz, and Michael Ward. *ICEWS coded event data*. Harvard Dataverse, 2015.

- **ICEWS05-15**: 
  > Elizabeth Boschee, Jennifer Lautenschlager, Sean O’Brien, Steve Shellman, James Starz, and Michael Ward. *ICEWS coded event data*. Harvard Dataverse, 2015.

- **WIKI**: 
  > Julien Leblay and Melisachew Wudage Chekol. *Deriving validity time in knowledge graph*. In Companion Proceedings of the The Web Conference 2018. International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee, 2018.

- **YAGO**: 
  > Farzaneh Mahdisoltani, Joanna Biega, and Fabian Suchanek. *Yago3: A knowledge base from multilingual wikipedias*. In 7th biennial conference on innovative data systems research. CIDR Conference, 2014.

- **GDELT**: 
  > Kalev Leetaru and Philip A Schrodt. *Gdelt: Global data on events, location, and tone, 1979–2012*. In ISA annual convention, 2013.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant details while maintaining proper attribution to the original sources.
