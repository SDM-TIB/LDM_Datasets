To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MDPFuzz: Testing Models Solving Markov Decision Processes" by Qi Pang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or testing.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference existing datasets that their work builds upon or evaluates against. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in the parts discussing experiments or evaluations, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used. This section typically outlines the specific datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any insights or findings related to the datasets, which may include performance metrics or comparisons.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "CARLA" for autonomous driving simulations, I would look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail. The citation might look something like this:
> Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). CARLA: An open urban driving simulator. In Conference on Robot Learning (pp. 1-16).

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
