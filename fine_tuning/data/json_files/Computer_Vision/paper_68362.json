The data is collected by sensors on the hands, elbows, wrists, and thumbs which recorded the x,y,z coordinates relatively to the person. The gestures were originally recorded at 20 FPS with an average duration of 2.34 seconds. In the given subset, all sequences are normalized to a sequence length of 51 time steps.",
