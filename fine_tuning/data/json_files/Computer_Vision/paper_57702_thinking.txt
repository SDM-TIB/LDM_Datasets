To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NoPe-NeRF: Optimising Neural Radiance Field with No Pose Prior" by Wenjing Bian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on two datasets: **Tanks and Temples** and **ScanNet**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research and likely contain important details.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. In **section 4.1**, they specifically mention:

1. **Tanks and Temples**: This dataset is used to evaluate pose accuracy and novel view synthesis quality across 8 scenes captured in both indoor and outdoor settings. The authors note that they down-sampled all images to a resolution of 960 × 540.

2. **ScanNet**: This dataset is selected for evaluating pose accuracy, depth accuracy, and novel view synthesis quality. The authors mention using 4 scenes and taking 80-100 consecutive images for their experiments, with a down-sampling to a resolution of 648 × 484.

I will then confirm the details of these datasets by checking the **References section** to find the full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Tanks and Temples**, the citation is:
  > Arno Knapitsch, Jaesik Park, Qian-Yi Zhou, and Vladlen Koltun. *Tanks and Temples: Benchmarking Large-Scale Scene Reconstruction*. ACM Transactions on Graphics, 2017.

- For **ScanNet**, the citation is:
  > Angela Dai, Angel X Chang, Manolis Savva, Maciej Halber, Thomas Funkhouser, and Matthias Nießner. *ScanNet: Richly-Annotated 3D Reconstructions of Indoor Scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
