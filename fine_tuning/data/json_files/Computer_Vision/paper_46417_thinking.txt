To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge Transfer Based Fine-Grained Visual Classification" by Siqing Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three popular FGVC datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Protocol)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Caltech-UCSD Birds (CUB)**: This dataset is widely used for fine-grained visual classification tasks involving bird species. 

2. **Stanford Cars (CAR)**: This dataset contains images of various car models and is commonly used for fine-grained classification in automotive contexts.

3. **FGVC-Aircraft (AIR)**: This dataset consists of images of different aircraft types and is utilized for fine-grained classification in the aviation domain.

In this section, the authors also mention that all experiments are conducted without any bounding box annotations, which is relevant for understanding the dataset's characteristics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For **Caltech-UCSD Birds (CUB)**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*. Tech. Rep. CNS-TR-2011-001, California Institute of Technology.

- For **Stanford Cars (CAR)**, the citation is:
  > Krause, J., Stark, M., Jia, D., & Li, F. (2013). *3D Object Representations for Fine-Grained Categorization*. In ICCV Workshops.

- For **FGVC-Aircraft (AIR)**, the citation is:
  > Maji, S., Rahtu, E., Kannala, J., Blaschko, M., & Vedaldi, A. (2013). *Fine-Grained Visual Classification of Aircraft*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1306.5151.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of fine-grained visual classification.
