To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sparse annotation strategies for segmentation of short axis cardiac MRI" by Josh Stein et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on two public datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they refer to:

1. **Automatic Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC)**: This dataset consists of 100 training cases, each with two fully annotated volumes (end-diastole and end-systole). The authors mention that they use 160 volumes for training and 40 for validation, totaling 3200 training slices.

2. **Multi-Centre, Multi-Vendor and Multi-Disease Cardiac Segmentation Challenge (M&Ms)**: This dataset includes 150 training cases, also with end-diastole and end-systole volumes annotated. The authors split this dataset into 240 training cases and 60 validation cases, resulting in 3360 training slices.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **ACDC dataset**, the citation is:
  > O. Bernard, A. Lalande, C. Zotti et al., *Deep learning techniques for automatic MRI cardiac multi-structures segmentation and diagnosis: Is the problem solved?* IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, vol. 37, no. 11, pp. 2514–2525, 2018.

- For the **M&Ms dataset**, the citation is:
  > V. M. Campello, P. Gkontra, C. Izquierdo et al., *Multi-centre, multi-vendor and multi-disease cardiac segmentation: the M&Ms challenge.* IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, vol. 40, no. 12, pp. 3543–3554, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, ensuring to include their names, descriptions, and full citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
