To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3DTI-Net: Learn Inner Transform Invariant 3D Geometry Features using Dynamic GCN" by Jun Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors discuss experiments on classification and segmentation tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention using the **ModelNet40** dataset for 3D object classification and the **ShapeNet Core55** dataset for 3D retrieval tasks. This is a clear indication that these datasets are central to their research.

In the **ModelNet40** subsection, the authors provide details about the dataset, stating that it contains 12,311 CAD models from 40 categories, with each model having 1,024 points sampled from the mesh faces. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

For the **ShapeNet Core55**, the authors mention that it consists of over 50,000 models across 55 categories, which is also important for the context of their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets:

- For **ModelNet40**, the citation is:
  > Charles R. Qi, Hao Su, Kaichun Mo, and Leonidas J. Guibas. *PointNet: Deep Learning on Point Sets for 3D Classification and Segmentation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 77â€“85, 2017.

- For **ShapeNet Core55**, the citation is:
  > Angel X. Chang, et al. *ShapeNet: An Information-Rich 3D Model Repository*. arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
