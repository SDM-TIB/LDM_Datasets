To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discrete synaptic events induce global oscillations in balanced neural networks" by Denis S. Goldobin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and conclusion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the experiments and any datasets used, while the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include dataset references.

Next, I will pay close attention to the **methods section**, as it typically details the experimental setup and any datasets utilized. If the authors mention specific datasets or provide descriptions of the data they collected, this is where I will find that information.

I will also look for any **figures or tables** that may summarize data or results derived from specific datasets. These often include captions or legends that can provide additional context about the datasets used in the study.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. If the datasets are well-known, I may also look for their citations in the text or in the references of other papers cited by the authors.

For this paper, I will specifically look for any datasets related to neural dynamics, synaptic events, or oscillatory behaviors, as these are the main themes of the research.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I accurately represent the authors' work and provide proper credit to the original sources.

Finally, I will organize the extracted information in a clear and structured manner, ready for further processing or review.
