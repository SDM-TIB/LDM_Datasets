To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Local 3D Editing via 3D Distillation of CLIP Knowledge" by Junha Hyung et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they state that LENeRF utilizes pretrained EG3D, which is trained on three specific datasets: **FFHQ**, **AFHQv2 CATS**, and **ShapeNet Cars**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is important because proper citation allows others to locate the original sources of the datasets.

1. **FFHQ (Flickr-Faces-HQ Dataset)**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. *A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, CVPR 2019, Long Beach, CA, USA, June 16-20, 2019, pages 4401–4410. Computer Vision Foundation / IEEE, 2019.

2. **AFHQv2 CATS**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Yunjey Choi, Youngjung Uh, Jaejun Yoo, and Jung-Woo Ha. *Stargan v2: Diverse image synthesis for multiple domains*. In 2020 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, CVPR 2020, Seattle, WA, USA, June 13-19, 2020, pages 8185–8194. Computer Vision Foundation / IEEE, 2020.

3. **ShapeNet Cars**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Angel X. Chang, et al. *ShapeNet: An Information-Rich 3D Model Repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

After gathering the dataset names and their respective citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This ensures that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for future reference or research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included and correctly formatted.
