To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SiTH: Single-view Textured Human Reconstruction with Image-Conditioned Diffusion" by Hsuan-I Ho et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference datasets that are critical to their research. Here, I note that the authors mention evaluations on "two 3D human benchmarks," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in the subsections discussing the training and evaluation processes, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets. The authors mention using the **THuman2.0 dataset** for training, which consists of approximately 500 scans of humans in various garments. This dataset is crucial for understanding the training data used in their experiments.

Additionally, in the **experiments section**, the authors discuss the **CAPE dataset** and the **CustomHumans dataset**. The CAPE dataset is used for quantitative evaluation and consists of 15 subjects in various outfits, while the CustomHumans dataset is a new benchmark created by the authors, containing 600 higher-quality scans of 80 subjects.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **References section**:

1. **THuman2.0 Dataset**:
   > Tao Yu, Zerong Zheng, Kaiwen Guo, Pengpeng Liu, Qiong-hai Dai, and Yebin Liu. *Function4d: Real-time human volumetric capture from very sparse consumer rgbd sensors*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021.

2. **CAPE Dataset**:
   > Qianli Ma, Jinlong Yang, Anurag Ranjan, Sergi Pujades, Gerard Pons-Moll, Siyu Tang, and Michael J. Black. *Learning to Dress 3D People in Generative Clothing*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

3. **CustomHumans Dataset**:
   > Hsuan-I Ho, Lixin Xue, Jie Song, and Otmar Hilliges. *Learning locally editable virtual humans*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset used in the research. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
