To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational Co-embedding Learning for Attributed Network Clustering" by Shuiqiao Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "four real-world attributed network datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present. I will look for specific names of these datasets in these sections.

Next, I will navigate to **section 5 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will look for a table or a list that outlines the datasets, including their characteristics such as the number of nodes, edges, attributes, and clusters. In this case, I find a table (Table 2) that provides the following datasets:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset with 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, 1,433 attributes, and 7 clusters.
2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network dataset with 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, 3,703 attributes, and 6 clusters.
3. **BlogCatalog**: A social network dataset with 5,196 nodes, 171,743 edges, 8,189 attributes, and 6 clusters.
4. **Flickr**: A social network dataset with 7,575 nodes, 239,738 edges, 12,047 attributes, and 9 clusters.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that the Cora and Citeseer datasets were created by Sen et al., and the BlogCatalog and Flickr datasets were created by other authors. I will look for the specific references that correspond to these datasets.

The citations I find are as follows:

- For **Cora** and **Citeseer** datasets:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, J., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-93.

- For **BlogCatalog** dataset:
  > Tang, L., & Liu, H. (2009). *Relational learning via latent social dimensions*. In Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD '09), 817-826.

- For **Flickr** dataset:
  > Huang, X., Li, J., & Hu, X. (2017). *Label informed attributed network embedding*. In Proceedings of the Tenth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM '17), 731-739.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
