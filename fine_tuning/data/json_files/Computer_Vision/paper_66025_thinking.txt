To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MTS-DVGAN: Anomaly Detection in Cyber-Physical Systems using a Dual Variational Generative Adversarial Network" by Haili Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted empirical experiments on three public datasets: **SWAT**, **WADI**, and **NSL_KDD**. This is a strong indication that these datasets will be detailed further in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically section 6) where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they provide a detailed description of each dataset, including their origins, characteristics, and the context in which they were used.

1. **SWAT Dataset**: This dataset was built by the iTrust institution from a testbed of a real-world water treatment plant. It consists of 495,000 normal records and 449,921 records that include both normal and attack data, with each record containing a label and 51 attributes of actuator and sensor values.

2. **WADI Dataset**: The WADI dataset is collected from the Water Distribution (WADI) testbed, which simulates both cyber and physical attacks. It contains 1,048,571 normal records and 172,801 records that include both normal and attack data, with each record having 126 features.

3. **NSL_KDD Dataset**: The NSL_KDD dataset is a refined version of the KDD CUP99 dataset, which is widely used for network traffic anomaly detection. It includes approximately 125,973 records in the training set and 22,544 records in the testing set, with each record containing 41 features.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the relevant details and citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent analysis or application of the research findings. Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy access and review.
