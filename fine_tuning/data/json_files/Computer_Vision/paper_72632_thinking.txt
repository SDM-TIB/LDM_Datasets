To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CGD: Constraint-Guided Diffusion Policies for UAV Trajectory Planning" by Kota Kondo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a novel approach for trajectory planning but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference the use of Imitation Learning (IL) and mention the need for expert demonstrations. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point. I will continue to the **methodology section** where the authors describe their approach in detail.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors do not have a specific section titled "Datasets," but they do refer to the use of a specific expert trajectory planner called **PANTHER***, which is crucial for their experiments. 

I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the PANTHER* planner, as it is essential to document the source of the expert demonstrations used in their approach. The relevant citation is:

- **PANTHER***: 
  > J. Tordesillas and J. P. How, “Panther: Perception-aware trajectory planner in dynamic environments,” IEEE Access, vol. 10, pp. 22 662–22 677, 2022.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the primary dataset used for training and evaluation in this research is derived from the PANTHER* planner.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. The dataset entry will reflect the use of the PANTHER* planner as the source of expert demonstrations for the trajectory planning tasks discussed in the paper.
