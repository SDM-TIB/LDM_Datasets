To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GENIU: A Restricted Data Access Unlearning for Imbalanced Data" by Chenhao Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights that the authors conducted experiments on several widely used datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention four benchmark datasets:

1. **Digits-MNIST**: This dataset contains 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples, with each sample being a 28 × 28 grayscale image associated with a label from ten classes (handwritten digits from 0 to 9).

2. **Fashion-MNIST**: Similar to Digits-MNIST, this dataset also contains 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples, with each sample being a 28 × 28 grayscale image representing ten different fashion items.

3. **Kuzushiji-MNIST**: This dataset consists of 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples, with each sample being a 28 × 28 grayscale image associated with one of ten Hiragana characters.

4. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset contains 50,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples, with each sample being an RGB image of size 32 × 32, associated with one of ten semantic classes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Digits-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Y. LeCun, L. Bottou, Y. Bengio, and P. Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proc. IEEE, 1998.

- For **Fashion-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > H. Xiao, K. Rasul, and R. Vollgraf. *Fashion-mnist: a novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. 2017.

- For **Kuzushiji-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > T. Clanuwat, M. Bober-Irizar, A. Kitamoto, A. Lamb, K. Yamamoto, and D. Ha. *Deep learning for classical japanese literature*. 2018.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > A. Krizhevsky, G. Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
