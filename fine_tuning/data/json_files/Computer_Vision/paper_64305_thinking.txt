To extract datasets from the research paper titled "InstaFlow: One Step is Enough for High-Quality Diffusion-Based Text-to-Image Generation" by Xingchao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information about the datasets used in the study.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved an FID score on the MS COCO dataset, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in their experiments. The introduction also discusses the importance of large-scale datasets for training generative models, hinting at the datasets that might be referenced later.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors specifically mention using the **MS COCO 2017** and **MS COCO 2014** datasets for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their sizes and any specific subsets mentioned.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide quantitative results based on these datasets, which further confirms their usage. They report FID scores for both MS COCO 2017 and MS COCO 2014, which solidifies their role in the evaluation of the proposed method.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the MS COCO datasets are as follows:

- For **MS COCO 2017**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V 13, pp. 740–755. Springer, 2014.

- For **MS COCO 2014**, the citation is the same as above, as the dataset is referenced in the same context.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper attribution.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be used for further analysis or processing.
