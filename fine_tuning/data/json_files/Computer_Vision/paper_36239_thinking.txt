To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sobolev GAN" by Youssef Mroueh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. These sections often provide a high-level overview of the research and may mention key datasets used in the study. In the abstract, the authors discuss the application of Sobolev GAN in semi-supervised learning on CIFAR-10, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** of the paper, as this section typically details the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions. The authors specifically mention using **CIFAR-10** for semi-supervised learning, which is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. For CIFAR-10, the citation is:
> Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Master's thesis, University of Toronto, 2009.

I will also look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, especially in the context of experiments or comparisons. If the authors refer to any additional datasets, I will ensure to note their names and descriptions as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will format the extracted information into a structured output, ready for further processing or review.
