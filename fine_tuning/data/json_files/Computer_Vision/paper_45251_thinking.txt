To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Boosting Continuous Sign Language Recognition via Cross Modality Augmentation" by Junfu Pu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on two continuous SLR benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset and Evaluation)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather**: This dataset is described as focusing on the German sign language and contains a total of 6,841 sentences performed by 9 different signers. It is recorded from a public television broadcast and has a vocabulary size of 1,295 sign words.

2. **CSL (Chinese Sign Language)**: This dataset consists of 5,000 videos performed by 50 signers, containing a total of 100 different sentences with a vocabulary size of 100 sign words.

In the same section, the authors provide detailed statistics about each dataset, including the number of signers, frames, duration, vocabulary size, and the division of training and test sets.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather dataset is referenced in the paper as follows:
- For RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather:
  > Koller, O., Forster, J., & Ney, H. (2015). Continuous sign language recognition: Towards large vocabulary statistical recognition systems handling multiple signers. *Computer Vision and Image Understanding*, 141, 108-125.

- For CSL:
  > Huang, J., Zhou, W., Zhang, Q., Li, H., & Li, W. (2018). Video-based sign language recognition without temporal segmentation. In *Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather
   - Citation: Koller, O., Forster, J., & Ney, H. (2015). Continuous sign language recognition: Towards large vocabulary statistical recognition systems handling multiple signers. *Computer Vision and Image Understanding*, 141, 108-125.

2. CSL (Chinese Sign Language)
   - Citation: Huang, J., Zhou, W., Zhang, Q., Li, H., & Li, W. (2018). Video-based sign language recognition without temporal segmentation. In *Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence*.

With this information, I am ready to proceed with any further processing or documentation as needed.
