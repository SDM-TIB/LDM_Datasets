To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sparse aNETT for Solving Inverse Problems with Deep Learning" by Daniel Obmann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a sparse reconstruction framework and references numerical results for sparse view CT, which suggests that datasets related to CT imaging might be involved. I will look for any specific dataset names or descriptions in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **application section (Section 3)**, where the authors discuss their numerical simulations. Here, they mention using data from the **Low Dose CT Grand Challenge** for their experiments. This is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for their work.

In **Section 3.1**, the authors specify that they used images from the Low Dose CT Grand Challenge, detailing that they took the first seven patients for training (4267 images), the next two for validation (1143 images), and the last patient for testing (526 images). This provides a clear breakdown of how the dataset was utilized.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Low Dose CT Grand Challenge dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **Low Dose CT Grand Challenge**, the citation is:
  > C. McCollough, “TU-FG-207A-04: Overview of the low dose CT grand challenge,” Med. Phys., vol. 43, no. 6Part35, pp. 3759–3760, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Low Dose CT Grand Challenge**: This dataset consists of CT images used for training, validation, and testing in the context of sparse view CT reconstruction. The dataset includes 4267 images for training, 1143 for validation, and 526 for testing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all necessary information is captured accurately and comprehensively.
