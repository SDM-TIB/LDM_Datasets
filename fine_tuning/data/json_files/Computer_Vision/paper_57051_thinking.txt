To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion Denoising Process for Perceptron Bias in Out-of-distribution Detection" by Luping Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on **CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet**, which suggests these datasets are used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors describe their experimental setup, indicating that they evaluated their methods on **OpenOOD benchmarks** using **CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet** as in-distribution datasets. They also mention various out-of-distribution datasets used for evaluation, including **TinyImagenet, SVHN, Texture, Places365, Species, and iNaturalist**.

Now, I will compile the datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **CIFAR10**: A widely used dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.

     > Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E. Hinton. *Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks*. Communications of the ACM, 60(6):84–90, 2017.

2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
   - Citation:

3. **ImageNet**: A large visual database designed for use in visual object recognition software research.
   - Citation:

4. **TinyImagenet**: A smaller version of ImageNet with 200 classes and 500 training images per class.
   - Citation: 
     > Tiny ImageNet Challenge. *https://tiny-imagenet.herokuapp.com/*.

5. **SVHN**: Street View House Numbers dataset, containing images of house numbers from Google Street View.
   - Citation: 
     > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. 2011.

6. **Texture**: A dataset for texture recognition tasks.
   - Citation: 
     > Mircea Cimpoi, Subhransu Maji, Iasonas Kokkinos, Sammy Mohamed, and Andrea Vedaldi. *Describing textures in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3606–3613, 2014.

7. **Places365**: A dataset for scene recognition with 365 categories.
   - Citation: 
     > Bolei Zhou, Agata Lapedriza, Aditya Khosla, Aude Oliva, and Antonio Torralba. *Places: A 10 million image database for scene recognition*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 40(6):1452–1464, 2017.

8. **Species**: A dataset for species classification.
   - Citation: 
     > Dan Hendrycks, Steven Basart, Mantas Mazeika, Mohammadreza Mostajabi, Jacob Steinhardt, and Dawn Song. *Scaling out-of-distribution detection for real-world settings*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.11132, 2019.

9. **iNaturalist**: A dataset for species identification.
   - Citation: 
     > Rui Huang and Yixuan Li. *Mos: Towards scaling out-of-distribution detection for large semantic space*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 8710–8719, 2021.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset, as they are crucial for proper referencing and validation of the datasets used in the research. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets from the paper.
