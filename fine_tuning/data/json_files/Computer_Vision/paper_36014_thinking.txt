To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning 3D-FilterMap for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks" by Yingzhen Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often discusses the context and previous work, which might reference datasets used in related studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (section 3), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, the authors mention that they trained their model on the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. This is a well-known dataset in the field of image classification.

I will then look for any additional details about the CIFAR-10 dataset, such as its size, structure, and any specific splits used for training and testing. The paper does not provide extensive details about the dataset, but I will note that CIFAR-10 consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset is commonly cited in the literature, and I can retrieve its citation from existing knowledge:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for CIFAR-10, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
