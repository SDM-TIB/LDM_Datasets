To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid Classical-Quantum Deep Learning Models for Autonomous Vehicle Traffic Image Classification Under Adversarial Attack" by Reek Majumdar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a "high dimensional LISA traffic sign image dataset," which suggests that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will look closely at the **methods section**, particularly where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using a subset of the **extended LISA traffic sign dataset**, which contains around 7,855 annotations from 6,610 video frames classifying 47 different traffic signs. This section provides valuable details about the dataset, including the number of samples and the classification tasks performed.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their models using this dataset, which further confirms its relevance. They also provide specific details about how they modified the dataset for their experiments, such as focusing on 18 traffic signs and splitting the data for training and testing.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the LISA dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **LISA Traffic Sign Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Møgelmose A, Liu D, Trivedi MM. *Detection of U.S. Traffic Signs*. IEEE Trans Intell Transp Syst. 2015 Dec;16(6):3116–25.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as it is crucial for proper attribution. 

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ready for further processing or review.
