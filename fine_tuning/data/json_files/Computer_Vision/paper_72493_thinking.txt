To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probing Unlearned Diffusion Models: A Transferable Adversarial Attack Perspective" by Xiaoxuan Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of adversarial attacks to probe unlearning methods, but it does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically described. In this section, the authors mention that they conducted experiments to evaluate their proposed method on various concepts, including objects, artist styles, NSFW content, and celebrity identities. However, they do not specify any datasets directly in the text.

I will also check the **related work section** (section 2) to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of previous studies. Here, the authors discuss various methods and their limitations, but again, no specific datasets are named.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will look at the **references section** to see if any cited works include datasets that may have been used in the experiments. I will pay particular attention to references that discuss datasets related to image generation, identity restoration, or concept erasure.

Upon reviewing the references, I find the following relevant citations that may correspond to datasets used in the context of the experiments:

1. **ImageNet**: This dataset is often used in image classification tasks and may have been utilized for training models referenced in the paper.
   - Citation: Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2009), pages 248–255, 2009.

2. **GIPHY Celebrity Detector**: This tool is mentioned in the context of detecting celebrity identities, suggesting that it may be based on a dataset of celebrity images.
   - Citation: Giphy. *GIPHY Celebrity Detector*, 2020.

3. **Nudenet**: This dataset is referenced for detecting nudity in images, indicating its use in the experiments related to NSFW content.
   - Citation: P Bedapudi. *Nudenet: Neural nets for nudity classification, detection and selective censoring*, 2019.

After identifying these datasets, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper attribution and further research.

In summary, I will document the following datasets based on the references found in the paper:

1. **ImageNet**
   - Citation: Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2009), pages 248–255, 2009.

2. **GIPHY Celebrity Detector**
   - Citation: Giphy. *GIPHY Celebrity Detector*, 2020.

3. **Nudenet**
   - Citation: P Bedapudi. *Nudenet: Neural nets for nudity classification, detection and selective censoring*, 2019.

Now, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing.
