To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FREEFLOW: A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING ON DIFFUSION PROBABILISTIC MODELS VIA OPTIMAL TRANSPORT" by Bowen Sun and Shibao Zheng, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Experiments," "Datasets," or "Methodology."** In this paper, I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets used.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets explicitly mentioned, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their use in the experiments. If the authors refer to datasets without providing full citations, I will need to look for the original sources in the **References section** to ensure I can provide complete citations.

In the **References section**, I will identify any papers that are cited as sources for datasets. I will extract the full citation for each dataset mentioned in the paper. If the authors refer to well-known datasets, I will verify their details and citations from reputable sources to ensure accuracy.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation formatted correctly.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted datasets are clearly documented, with a focus on accuracy and completeness in the citations, as this is crucial for proper attribution and further research.
