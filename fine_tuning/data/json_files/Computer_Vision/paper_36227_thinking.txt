To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Random Erasing Data Augmentation" by Zhun Zhong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but I will need to look deeper for specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention several datasets for different tasks:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset contains 50,000 training and 10,000 testing images, each of size 32x32 pixels, across 10 classes.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images.
3. **Fashion-MNIST**: A dataset of 60,000 training and 10,000 testing grayscale images of clothing items, each 28x28 pixels, categorized into 10 classes.
4. **PASCAL VOC 2007**: A dataset for object detection containing 9,963 images with annotated objects.
5. **Market-1501**: A dataset for person re-identification with 32,668 labeled bounding boxes of 1,501 identities.
6. **DukeMTMC-reID**: Another person re-identification dataset with 36,411 images of 1,812 identities.
7. **CUHK03**: A dataset containing 14,096 images of 1,467 identities, used for evaluating multi-shot re-ID performance.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. Here are the citations I will extract:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **Fashion-MNIST**:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

- For **PASCAL VOC 2007**:
  > M. Everingham, L. Van Gool, C. K. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. IJCV, 2010.

- For **Market-1501**:
  > Zheng, L., Shen, L., Tian, L., Wang, S., Wang, J., and Tian, Q. *Scalable Person Re-identification: A Benchmark*. In ICCV, 2015.

- For **DukeMTMC-reID**:
  > Ristani, E., Solera, F., Zou, R., Cucchiara, R., and Tomasi, C. *Performance Measures and a Data Set for Multi-Target, Multi-Camera Tracking*. In ECCVW, 2016.

- For **CUHK03**:
  > Li, W., Zhao, R., Xiao, T., and Wang, X. *DeepReid: Deep Filter Pairing Neural Network for Person Re-identification*. In CVPR, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
