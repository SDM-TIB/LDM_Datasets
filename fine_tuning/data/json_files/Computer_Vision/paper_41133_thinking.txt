To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optic-Net: A Novel Convolutional Neural Network for Diagnosis of Retinal Diseases from Optical Tomography Images" by Sharif Amit Kamran et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors benchmark their model on two separately available Retinal SD-OCT datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **OCT2017 Dataset**: This dataset is used to recognize and differentiate between four distinct retinal states: normal healthy retina, Drusen, Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV), and Diabetic Macular Edema (DME). The dataset contains 84,484 images, which are split into a training set of 83,484 images and a test set of 1,000 images.

2. **Srinivasan2014 Dataset**: This dataset consists of three classes: normal healthy specimens of retina, Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), and Diabetic Macular Edema (DME). It contains 3,231 image samples, which are split into a training set of 2,916 images and a test set of 315 images.

To ensure accuracy, I will also check the **References section** for the full citations of these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **OCT2017 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kermany, D. S., Goldbaum, M., Cai, W., Valentim, C. C., Liang, H., Baxter, S. L., McKeown, A., Yang, G., Wu, X., Yan, F., et al. (2018). Identifying medical diagnoses and treatable diseases by image-based deep learning. *Cell*, 172(5), 1122-1131.

- For the **Srinivasan2014 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Srinivasan, P. P., Kim, L. A., Mettu, P. S., Cousins, S. W., Comer, G. M., Izatt, J. A., & Farsiu, S. (2014). Fully automated detection of diabetic macular edema and dry age-related macular degeneration from optical coherence tomography images. *Biomedical optics express*, 5(10), 3568-3577.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective references from the paper.
