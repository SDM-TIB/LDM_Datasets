To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning from Stochastic Labels" by Meng Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "widely-used benchmark datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention four datasets:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, consisting of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9).
2. **Fashion-MNIST**: A dataset of 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items, intended as a more challenging replacement for MNIST.
3. **Kuzushiji-MNIST**: A dataset similar to MNIST but containing images of handwritten Japanese characters.
4. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, commonly used for image classification tasks.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For **Fashion-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Ludwig Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

- For **Kuzushiji-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > T. Clanuwat, M. Bober-Irizar, A. Kitamoto, A. Lamb, K. Yamamoto, and D. Ha. *Deep learning for classical Japanese literature*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1812.01718, 2018.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > A. Torralba, R. Fergus, and W. T. Freeman. *80 million tiny images: A large data set for nonparametric object and scene recognition*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 30(11):1958–1970, 2008.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or reference.
