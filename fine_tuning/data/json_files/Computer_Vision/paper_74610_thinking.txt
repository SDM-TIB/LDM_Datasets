To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Does Object Grounding Really Reduce Hallucination of Large Vision-Language Models?" by Gregor Geigle et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of large vision-language models (LVLMs) and hints at the use of datasets for this purpose. 

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two primary datasets:

1. **MSCOCO**: This dataset is referenced multiple times throughout the paper, particularly in the context of evaluating hallucination in LVLMs. The authors note that MSCOCO is a widely used dataset for image captioning and visual question answering tasks.

2. **Objects365**: This dataset is introduced as a complement to MSCOCO, providing a larger inventory of object classes (365 classes in total). The authors specify that they evaluate on 5000 images from the test portion of MSCOCO and 5386 images from the validation portion of Objects365.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MSCOCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge J. Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Computer Vision - ECCV 2014 - 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V, volume 8693 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pages 740–755. Springer.

- For **Objects365**, the citation is:
  > Shuai Shao, Zeming Li, Tianyuan Zhang, Chao Peng, Gang Yu, Xiangyu Zhang, Jing Li, and Jian Sun. *Objects365: A Large-Scale, High-Quality Dataset for Object Detection*. In 2019 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, ICCV 2019, Seoul, Korea (South), October 27 - November 2, 2019, pages 8429–8438. IEEE.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **MSCOCO** with its citation.
2. **Objects365** with its citation.

This methodical approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately from the research paper.
