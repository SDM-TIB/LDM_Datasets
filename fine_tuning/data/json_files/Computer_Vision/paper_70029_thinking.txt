To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Networks for Portfolio-Level Risk Management: Portfolio Compression, Static Hedging, Counterparty Credit Risk Exposures and Impact on Capital Requirement" by Vikranth Lokeshwar Dhandapani and Shashi Jain, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not detail specific datasets. However, it does mention the use of numerical examples and simulations, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets or data sources that were used in their experiments. The introduction discusses the context of portfolio compression and risk management but does not explicitly mention datasets.

Moving on to the **methodology section**, I will look for details about the training data used for the neural network. The authors mention that the data for training the neural network is obtained by simulating paths of the underlying asset using the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) process. This indicates that the dataset is generated through simulation rather than sourced from existing datasets.

In the **results section**, I will check for any references to datasets used for validation or benchmarking. The authors discuss the performance of the proposed method using numerical experiments, but again, they do not cite any external datasets.

Since the paper primarily discusses simulated data rather than publicly available datasets, I will note that the main dataset is generated through simulations rather than sourced from external databases. The authors do not provide specific citations for datasets since they are not using established datasets but rather creating their own for the purpose of the study.

Finally, I will summarize the findings regarding datasets in the paper. The key points are:
1. The primary dataset is simulated data generated using the GBM process.
2. There are no external datasets cited in the paper, as the authors focus on their own simulations for training and validation.

In conclusion, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the nature of the datasets used in the research, emphasizing that they are simulated rather than sourced from existing datasets.
