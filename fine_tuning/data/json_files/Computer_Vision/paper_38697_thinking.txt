To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Better Guider Predicts Future Better: Difference Guided Generative Adversarial Networks" by Guohao Ying et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors achieve state-of-the-art performance on **UCF-101, KITTI, and Human 3.6M datasets**. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors describe their evaluation setup. In **section 4.1 (Experimental Set-up)**, they explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **UCF-101 Dataset**: The authors mention that this dataset contains 13,320 annotated videos of various human activities. They specify that they used the first subset for training and testing.

2. **KITTI Dataset**: This dataset includes various driving scenarios from different road conditions, and the authors note that they used training and testing sets from two categories: road and cars.

3. **Human 3.6M Dataset**: This dataset consists of videos capturing various human motions, and the authors extracted frames from these videos for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **UCF-101 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Soomro, K., Zamir, A.R., & Shah, M. (2012). *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402.

- For **KITTI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Geiger, A., Lenz, P., Stiller, C., & Urtasun, R. (2013). *Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, 32(11), 1231–1237.

- For **Human 3.6M Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ionescu, C., Papava, D., Olaru, V., & Sminchisescu, C. (2014). *Human3.6M: Large scale datasets and predictive methods for 3D human sensing in natural environments*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 36(7), 1325–1339.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
