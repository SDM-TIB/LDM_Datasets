To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast, Accurate and Lightweight Super-Resolution with Neural Architecture Search" by Xiangxiang Chu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of deep convolutional neural networks for super-resolution but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that recent works on single image super-resolution (SISR) have shifted towards deep learning, but again, no specific datasets are named. I will continue to the **experiments section**, as this is often where datasets are detailed.

In **section VI (Experiments)**, the authors state that they used the **DIV2K dataset** for training their models. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized in their experiments. I will note this down.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DIV2K dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for DIV2K in the references, but I know from external sources that the DIV2K dataset is commonly cited as follows:

- **DIV2K Dataset**: 
  > Agustsson, E., & Timofte, R. (2017). *NTIRE 2017 Challenge on Single Image Super-Resolution: Dataset and Study*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW), 2017, pp. 126â€“135.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **DIV2K Dataset**: Used for training the models in the experiments.

Finally, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset.
