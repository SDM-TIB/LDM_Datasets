To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Inferring User Socioeconomic Status with Mobility Records" by Zheng Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "real mobility records data, POI data, and house prices data," which suggests that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about each dataset in the **methodology section**. The authors describe three datasets:

1. **Geolife Dataset**: This dataset consists of GPS trajectories generated by users, containing 24,876,978 records over five years, primarily from Beijing. The authors note that it is publicly available without personal information, which is important for ethical considerations.

2. **POI Data**: The authors collected Point-of-Interest (POI) data through the Amap Map API, which includes 156,653 records in Beijing. This dataset provides various attributes such as venue name, category, and location.

3. **House Price Data**: This dataset was collected by crawling online housing agents (specifically Lianjia), containing 8,124 residential sale prices in Beijing. The authors explain that this data is used to reflect users' socioeconomic statuses.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for their experiments, further validating their importance.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Geolife Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zheng, Y., Xie, X., Ma, W.-Y., et al. "Geolife: A collaborative social networking service among user, location and trajectory." IEEE Data Eng. Bull., vol. 33, no. 2, pp. 32â€“39, 2010.

- For the **Amap Map API** used for POI data, there is no specific citation provided in the references, but it can be referenced as:
  > Amap Map Service. Available at: https://lbs.amap.com/api/webservice/summary/.

- For the **House Price Data**, the citation for the source is:
  > Lianjia. Available at: https://www.lianjia.com.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or analysis.
