To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Computational Framework for Atrioventricular Valve Modeling Using Open-Source Software" by Wensi Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a concise overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may hint at the datasets used. The introduction often discusses the background and significance of the research, potentially mentioning key datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, as it typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research. For instance, if the authors mention using specific imaging data or computational models derived from certain datasets, I will note those down.

In this paper, the authors describe the use of **3D echocardiography-derived models** for the mitral and tricuspid valves. They mention that the mitral valve model was based on a 15-year-old male with normal heart anatomy, and the tricuspid valve model was based on a 3-year-old male with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. These details indicate that the datasets are derived from clinical imaging data, which is crucial for the study.

I will also check the **results section** for any additional information about the datasets, such as performance metrics or comparisons with other datasets. This can help confirm the datasets' relevance and importance in the context of the research.

After gathering all the necessary information about the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is critical, as proper citation is essential for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors refer to a specific imaging database or a previously published dataset, I will ensure to extract the complete citation details, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of use in future references or analyses.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all relevant datasets from the research paper.
