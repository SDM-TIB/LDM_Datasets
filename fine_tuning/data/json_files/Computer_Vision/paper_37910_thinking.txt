To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PanoRoom: From the Sphere to the 3D Layout" by Clara Fernandez-Labrador et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions and may hint at the datasets used. In this case, the authors mention that their approach outperforms existing methods on standard benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **SUN360 Dataset**: The authors state that they utilize approximately 500 panoramas from this dataset, which are labeled for indoor scenes. They also mention that they hand-label 35 panoramas to better represent the actual shapes of the rooms.

2. **Stanford 2D-3D Dataset**: The authors indicate that they use this dataset for testing, specifically referring to area 5 and the ground truth provided by another source.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **SUN360 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xiao, J., Ehinger, K., Oliva, A., Torralba, A. *Recognizing scene viewpoint using panoramic place representation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2695â€“2702, 2012.

- For the **Stanford 2D-3D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Armeni, I., Sax, A., Zamir, A.R., Savarese, S. *Joint 2D-3D-Semantic Data for Indoor Scene Understanding*. arXiv:1702.01105, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
