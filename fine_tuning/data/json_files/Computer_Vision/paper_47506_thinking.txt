To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DivAug: Plug-in Automated Data Augmentation with Explicit Diversity Maximization" by Zirui Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their method on several benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly state that they adopt four benchmark datasets for evaluating their proposed method: **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet**. Each dataset is likely to have specific characteristics and details that I need to capture.

I will then look for the **details about each dataset** in the paper. The authors provide a brief description of each dataset in Section 4.1, including the number of images and the classes involved. Here’s what I find:

1. **CIFAR-10**: Composed of 50,000 colored images with 10 classes, each image is of size 32 × 32.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but contains 100 classes, also with 50,000 colored images of size 32 × 32.
3. **SVHN**: Contains 73,257 training images and 26,032 testing images of house numbers.
4. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with approximately 1.2 million training images across 1,000 classes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- **SVHN**:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. 2011.

- **ImageNet**:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work or research.
