To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-supervised sequence classification through change point detection" by Nauman Ahad and Mark A. Davenport, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors provide extensive synthetic simulations and improved results on real-world human activity recognition datasets, indicating that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** to find specific datasets used in their evaluations. In this section, the authors describe their experiments and mention two datasets explicitly:

1. **HCI Gesture Recognition Dataset**: This dataset consists of users performing five different gestures using IMUs placed on the arm. The authors note that they used the free-hand subset for their experiments.

2. **WISDM Activity Recognition Dataset**: This dataset includes data collected from accelerometers mounted on participants' chests, where users perform various activities such as running, walking, and sitting.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **HCI Gesture Recognition Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kilian Forster, Daniel Roggen, and Gerhard Troster. *Unsupervised classifier self-calibration through repeated context occurrences: Is there robustness against sensor displacement to gain?* In 2009 IEEE Int. Symp. on Wearable Computers (ISWC), 2009.

- For the **WISDM Activity Recognition Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kilian Forster, Daniel Roggen, and Gerhard Troster. *Unsupervised classifier self-calibration through repeated context occurrences: Is there robustness against sensor displacement to gain?* In 2009 IEEE Int. Symp. on Wearable Computers (ISWC), 2009.

Although both datasets are cited from the same source, it is important to note that they are distinct datasets used for different purposes in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
