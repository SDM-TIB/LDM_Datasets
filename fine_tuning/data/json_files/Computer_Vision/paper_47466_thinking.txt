To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-frame Super-resolution from Noisy Data" by Kireeti Bodduna, Joachim Weickert, and Marcelo CÃ¡rdenas, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include mentions of datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of multi-frame super-resolution in the presence of noise and mention that they will evaluate their methods on various datasets. This indicates that datasets are indeed present, but I need to locate their specific names and details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant subsections that might list the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in the **experiments section**. Specifically, they refer to the following datasets:

1. **Lena**: A standard test image used in image processing, often utilized for denoising and super-resolution tasks.
2. **House**: Another common test image used in various image processing applications.
3. **Peppers**: A frequently used image in the field of image processing for testing algorithms.
4. **Bridge**: A test image that is also used in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about how these images were corrupted with clipped additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) for their denoising experiments. This confirms that these datasets are integral to their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these images are widely recognized standard test images, they may not have formal citations like datasets from specific studies. Instead, I will note their common usage in the field:

- **Lena**: Often cited as "Lena (or Lenna) image, a standard test image in image processing."
- **House**: Commonly referred to as "House image, used in various image processing tasks."
- **Peppers**: Known as "Peppers image, a standard test image in image processing."
- **Bridge**: Referred to as "Bridge image, used in image processing experiments."

Since these images are well-known in the community, I will summarize their usage without formal citations, but I will ensure to mention their significance in the context of the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name and its relevance to the research, ensuring that I include the context in which they were used in the experiments.
