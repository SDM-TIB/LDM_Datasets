To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Radiance Fields for Novel View Synthesis in Monocular Gastroscopy" by Zijie Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to look for specific dataset names and details in the main body of the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional gastroscopy and the need for novel view synthesis, but they do not mention specific datasets yet. I will continue to the **methodology** section, where they describe their approach in detail.

In **section III (Experimental Results)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for evaluation: **Seq. A** and **Seq. B**. They describe these datasets as monocular gastroscopic videos obtained from two different subjects, with Seq. A consisting of 833 images and Seq. B consisting of 424 images. This is crucial information for dataset extraction.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works that may have been referenced. However, since Seq. A and Seq. B are original datasets created for this study, they may not have external citations. Instead, I will note that these datasets were obtained from a previous study by the authors, which is referenced as [9].

The citation for the previous study is:
> A. R. Widya, Y. Monno, K. Imahori, M. Okutomi, S. Suzuki, T. Gotoda, and K. Miki. *3D reconstruction of whole stomach from endoscope video using structure-from-motion*. In Proceedings of the EMBC, 2019.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the previous study that provides context for Seq. A and Seq. B.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited.
