To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FashionSD-X: Multimodal Fashion Garment Synthesis using Latent Diffusion" by Abhishek Kumar Singh, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used state-of-the-art fashion virtual try-on datasets, specifically mentioning **Multimodal Dress Code** and **VITON-HD**. This is a strong indication that these datasets are central to the research.

Next, I will look into the **methodology section**, where the author describes the datasets in detail. Here, the paper states that they used two existing virtual try-on datasets: **Dress Code** and **VITON-HD**, and that these datasets were extended to include additional multimodal information such as sketches and text descriptions.

In the **experimental setup section**, the author provides a comparison of publicly available datasets for fashion, including the number of images, unique texts, and sketches associated with each dataset. This section confirms the datasets used and provides additional context about their characteristics.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The citations are typically found in the **References section**. The relevant citations for the datasets are:

1. **Dress Code Dataset**:
   > Morelli, D., et al. (2022). *Dress code: High-resolution multi-category virtual try-on*. arXiv.org. Available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08532 (Accessed: 25 August 2023).

2. **VITON-HD Dataset**:
   > Choi, S., et al. (2021). *Viton-HD: High-resolution virtual try-on via misalignment-aware normalization*. arXiv.org. Available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16874 (Accessed: 25 August 2023).

After confirming the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the key details for each dataset:

- **Multimodal Dress Code**: Contains 53,792 images of garments, with fine-grained and coarse-grained text prompts for 26,400 garments.
- **VITON-HD**: Contains 13,679 images, with corresponding sketches and text descriptions.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or analysis.
