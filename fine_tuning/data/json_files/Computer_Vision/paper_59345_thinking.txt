To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GANN: Graph Alignment Neural Network for Semi-Supervised Learning" by Linxuan Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive studies on graph benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly list eight datasets:

1. **DBLP**: A network structure connecting authors from various domains, indicating co-authorship.
2. **ACM**: A network of papers where edges represent shared authorship.
3. **AMAP**: A graph of Amazon product purchases, where nodes are products and edges indicate frequent co-purchases.
4. **AMAC**: Similar to AMAP, representing another aspect of Amazon's purchasing data.
5. **Cora-ML**: A citation graph where nodes represent articles and edges denote citation relationships.
6. **CiteSeer**: Another citation graph with similar characteristics to Cora-ML.
7. **PubMed**: A dataset representing citation relationships among medical articles.
8. **MS-Academic**: A co-authorship network among academic papers.

In the **dataset statistics table (Table 2)**, I will find additional details such as the number of nodes, edges, features, classes, and label rates for each dataset. This information is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. While the paper may not provide specific citations for all datasets, I will look for the original sources or relevant papers that describe these datasets.

For example, I can find citations for:
- **Cora-ML**: Abu-El-Haija, S.; Kapoor, A.; Perozzi, B.; and Lee, J. (2020). N-gcn: Multi-scale graph convolution for semi-supervised node classification. In Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, 841–851. PMLR.
- **CiteSeer**: Shchur, O.; Mumme, M.; Bojchevski, A.; and Günnemann, S. (2018). Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.05868.
- **PubMed**: Namata, G.; London, B.; Getoor, L.; Huang, B.; and Edu, U. (2012). Query-driven active surveying for collective classification. In 10th International Workshop on Mining and Learning with Graphs, volume 8, 1.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, details, and full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all information is accurate and complete for further processing or review.
