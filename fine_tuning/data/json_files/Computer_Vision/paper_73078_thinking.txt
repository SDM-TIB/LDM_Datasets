To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Switched Flow Matching: Eliminating Singularities via Switching ODEs" by Qunxi Zhu and Wei Lin, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and conclusion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through "several numerical examples," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

Upon reviewing Section 6, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Synthetic Datasets**: The authors describe using synthetic datasets for initial experiments, specifically mentioning a 1-dimensional Gaussian mixture (2-modes) and a checkerboard pattern. However, these datasets are not formally cited as they are generated for the purpose of the study.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This is a well-known dataset used for image classification tasks. The authors mention using it to evaluate their method. I will need to find the full citation for this dataset in the references section.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The citation is:

- For **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2010. URL: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

Since the synthetic datasets do not have formal citations, I will only document the CIFAR-10 dataset with its citation.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset is included, as it is crucial for proper attribution.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- **Synthetic Datasets**: No formal citation.
- **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: 
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2010. URL: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

This process ensures that I have thoroughly identified and documented the datasets used in the research paper.
