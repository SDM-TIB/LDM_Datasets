To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pareto-Optimal Learning from Preferences with Hidden Context" by Ryan Boldi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the concept of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and mentions empirical evaluations, which may indicate the use of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors detail their empirical investigations. This section typically contains information about the datasets used for testing their proposed method. I will look for any specific names of datasets or descriptions that indicate the nature of the data used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using a dataset of demonstrations \(D\) and a series of pairwise preferences \(P\). However, they do not provide specific names or citations for these datasets. I will need to check the **references section** to see if any of the cited works provide datasets that are relevant to the experiments conducted in this paper.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite several works that may contain datasets or methodologies relevant to their experiments. I will extract the full citations for these references to ensure proper attribution.

1. **LLAMA-2-7b Preference Model**: The authors mention using the pre-trained LLAMA-2-7b model, which is detailed in the following citation:
   > Touvron, H., Martin, L., Stone, K., Albert, P., Almahairi, A., Babaei, Y., Bashlykov, N., Batra, S., Bhargava, P., et al. (2023). *Llama 2: Open foundation and fine-tuned chat models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.09288.

2. **Bayesian Reward Extrapolation (B-REx)**: This method is referenced in the context of reward learning, and the citation is:
   > Brown, D., Niekum, S., & Petrik, M. (2020). *Bayesian Robust Optimization for Imitation Learning*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (Vol. 33, pp. 2479â€“2491).

3. **Distributional Preference Learning (DPL)**: This method is also mentioned, and the citation is:
   > Siththaranjan, A., Laidlaw, C., & Hadfield-Menell, D. (2023). *Distributional preference learning: Understanding and accounting for hidden context in rlhf*. arXiv preprint.

After identifying these references, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is properly cited according to the information provided in the paper and its references.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation for future reference.
