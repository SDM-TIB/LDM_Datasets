To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Boosting Diffusion Models with Moving Average Sampling in Frequency Domain" by Yurui Qian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study.

In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on various datasets, including **ImageNet** and **MS-COCO**. I will note these datasets and any specific details provided about them, such as the number of samples or the resolution of images used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
> Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009.

For **MS-COCO**, the citation is:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Doll√°r, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and ready for presentation or further processing.
