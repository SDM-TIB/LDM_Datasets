To extract datasets from the research paper titled "6D-Diff: A Keypoint Diffusion Framework for 6D Object Pose Estimation" by Li Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on the **LM-O** and **YCB-V** datasets, which suggests these are the primary datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors describe the **LM-O Dataset** as containing 1,214 images, which is a challenging subset of the Linemod dataset, often featuring heavily occluded objects. They also mention the **YCB-V Dataset**, which is a large-scale dataset with over 100,000 real images of 21 objects, also characterized by occlusions and cluttered backgrounds.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of these datasets:

1. **LM-O Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Brachmann, E., Michel, F., Krull, A., Yang, M. Y., Gumhold, S., et al. (2016). *Uncertainty-driven 6D pose estimation of objects and scenes from a single RGB image*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3364–3372.

2. **YCB-V Dataset**: The citation is:
   > G. Wang, F. Manhardt, X. Liu, and X. Ji. (2019). *YCB-Video: A Large-Scale Benchmark for 6D Object Pose Estimation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1000–1009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset:

- **LM-O Dataset**: A challenging dataset containing 1,214 images with around 8 objects per image, often heavily occluded.
- **YCB-V Dataset**: A large-scale dataset with over 100,000 real images of 21 objects, characterized by occlusions and cluttered backgrounds.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
