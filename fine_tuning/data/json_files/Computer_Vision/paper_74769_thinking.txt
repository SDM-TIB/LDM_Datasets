To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-Supervised Variational Autoencoder for Cell Feature Extraction in Multiplexed Immunofluorescence Images" by Piumi Sandarenu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a cohort of **more than 44,000 multiplexed immunofluorescence cell image patches** extracted from **1,093 tissue microarray cores of breast cancer patients**. This suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.1 (Dataset and experimental details)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They mention that the dataset consists of **18 tissue microarrays (TMAs)**, each containing **9 channels corresponding to 9 biomarker stains**. The total number of TMA cores is **1,093**, collected from a cohort of **450 breast cancer patients**. They also describe the preprocessing steps and the final dataset of **44,400 randomly selected cell detections** representing six cell phenotypes.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for any datasets or tools mentioned. The authors reference **QuPath** for generating cell phenotype labels, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context. The citation for QuPath is:
> Bankhead, P., et al. "QuPath: Open source software for digital pathology image analysis." *Scientific Reports*, vol. 7, no. 1, pp. 1â€“7, 2017.

While the paper does not provide a formal dataset citation for the TMA dataset itself, I can summarize the dataset details based on the information provided in the methodology section.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **Multiplexed Immunofluorescence Cell Image Dataset**: This dataset consists of **44,400 cell image patches** extracted from **1,093 TMA cores** of **450 breast cancer patients**, with images stained using **9 fluorescently labelled antibodies**.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring to include the relevant citations and details as required.
