To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Instrumentalist Net: Unsupervised Generation of Music from Body Movements" by Kun Su et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on two datasets containing videos of 13 instruments, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4 (Experiments & Results)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **URMP Dataset**: This dataset is described as a high-quality multi-instrument video dataset recorded in a studio, which includes 13 instruments and provides musical scores in Midi format. The authors specify that it contains 44 videos and 148 tracks, with 135 tracks used for training and 13 for testing.

2. **Solos Dataset**: This dataset consists of YouTube videos featuring musicians playing different instruments for auditions. It also includes the same 13 instruments as the URMP dataset, totaling 755 videos. The authors note that it contains pre-processed skeleton keypoints but lacks Midi files due to the nature of the videos.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **URMP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bochen Li, Xinzhao Liu, Karthik Dinesh, Zhiyao Duan, and Gaurav Sharma. *Creating a multitrack classical music performance dataset for multimodal music analysis: Challenges, insights, and applications*. IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, 21(2):522â€“535, 2018.

- For the **Solos Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Juan F Montesinos, Olga Slizovskaia, and Gloria Haro. *Solos: A dataset for audio-visual music analysis*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.07931, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective references from the paper.
