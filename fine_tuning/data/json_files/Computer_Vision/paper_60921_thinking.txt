To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PerFedRec++: Enhancing Personalized Federated Recommendation with Self-Supervised Pre-Training" by Sichun Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that experiments were conducted on three real-world datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiment)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they summarize the statistics of three datasets:

1. **Yelp Dataset**: This dataset is widely used in recommendation systems and was adopted from the 2018 edition of the Yelp challenge. It contains user reviews and ratings.

2. **Amazon-Kindle Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from Amazon review data and is used to recommend e-books to users.

3. **Gowalla Dataset**: This dataset contains check-in data from the Gowalla social network, where users share their locations by checking in.

The paper provides a summary of the statistics for each dataset, including the number of users, items, ratings, and density, which confirms their relevance for the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Yelp Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yelp. 2018. *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge.

- For the **Amazon-Kindle Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ruining He and Julian McAuley. 2016. *Ups and downs: Modeling the visual evolution of fashion trends with one-class collaborative filtering*. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web. 507–517.

- For the **Gowalla Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dawen Liang, Laurent Charlin, James McInerney, and David M Blei. 2016. *Modeling user exposure in recommendation*. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web. 951–961.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for further processing or review.
