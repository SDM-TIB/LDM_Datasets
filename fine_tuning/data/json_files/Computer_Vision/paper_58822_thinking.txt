To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Compositional Generation with Energy-Based Diffusion Models and MCMC" by Yilun Du et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of diffusion models and mentions applications in various domains, which may hint at specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) closely, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their content or structure.

In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in the context of their experiments:

1. **CLEVR Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 200,000 images with varying numbers of cubes (1 to 5) and is used to evaluate the accuracy of generated images in terms of object placement.

2. **ImageNet Dataset**: The authors mention using the ImageNet dataset for training their models, specifically for text-to-image generation tasks.

3. **Synthetic Datasets**: The paper also refers to synthetic datasets created for testing their models, which include Gaussian mixtures and uniform distributions.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **CLEVR Dataset**:
  > Johnson, J., Hariharan, B., Van Der Maaten, L., Fei-Fei, L., Zitnick, C. L., & Girshick, R. (2017). *CLEVR: A diagnostic dataset for compositional language and elementary visual reasoning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 2901-2910.

- For **ImageNet Dataset**:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L. J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 248-255.

- For **Synthetic Datasets**: Since these datasets are generated by the authors and do not have a formal citation, I will note that they are described in the paper but do not have a specific reference.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
