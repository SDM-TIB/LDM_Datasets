To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond Forward Shortcuts: Fully Convolutional Master-Slave Networks (MSNets) with Backward Skip Connections for Semantic Segmentation" by Abrar H. Abdulnabi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their model on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **ADE20K**: This dataset is described as having 20,210 training images, 2,000 validation images, and 3,352 testing images, created for the ImageNet scene parsing challenge, with the task of labeling each pixel to one of 150 semantic classes.

2. **PASCAL-Context**: This dataset consists of 4,998 training images and 5,105 testing images, originally sampled from the PASCAL VOC 2010 dataset and re-labeled for pixel-level segmentation. The authors note that they only consider 59 classes for evaluation.

3. **PASCAL VOC 2011**: This dataset includes approximately 11,287 training images, 736 validation images, and 1,111 testing images, with the task of classifying each pixel into one of 21 categories.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **ADE20K**, the citation is:
  > B. Zhou, H. Zhao, X. Puig, S. Fidler, A. Barriuso, and A. Torralba. *Semantic understanding of scenes through the ADE20K dataset*. CoRR, abs/1608.05442, 2016.

- For **PASCAL-Context**, the citation is:
  > R. Mottaghi, X. Chen, X. Liu, N.-G. Cho, S.-W. Lee, S. Fidler, R. Urtasun, and A. Yuille. *The role of context for object detection and semantic segmentation in the wild*. In CVPR, 2014.

- For **PASCAL VOC 2011**, the citation is:
  > M. Everingham, L. Van Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2011 (VOC2011) Results*. http://www.pascal-network.org/challenges/VOC/voc2011/workshop/index.html.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use.
