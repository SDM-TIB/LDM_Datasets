To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RoSteALS: Robust Steganography using Autoencoder Latent Space" by Tu Bui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that RoSteALS is evaluated on three benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **MIRFlickR Dataset**: This dataset is used for training and validation, consisting of 100K images for training and 1K images for validation.

2. **CLIC Dataset**: A benchmark containing a mix of 530 high-quality mobile and professional photographs, often used to evaluate image compression and rate-distortion techniques.

3. **MetFace Dataset**: A narrow-domain collection of 1,336 human faces extracted from artwork.

4. **Stock1K Dataset**: A collection of 1,000 high-quality multimedia images, including photographs, vector arts, sketches, and graphic designs.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that these datasets are indeed used for training and evaluation, providing further validation of their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MIRFlickR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mark J. Huiskes and Michael S. Lew. *The MIR Flickr Retrieval Evaluation*. In Proceedings of the 1st ACM International Conference on Multimedia Information Retrieval, pages 39–43, 2008.

- For the **CLIC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > G. Toderici, W. Shi, R. Timofte, L. Theis, J. Ballé, E. Agustsson, Nick Johnston, and F. Mentzer. *Workshop and Challenge on Learned Image Compression (CLIC2020)*. In CVPR, 2020.

- For the **MetFace Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tero Karras, Miika Aittala, Janne Hellsten, Samuli Laine, Jaakko Lehtinen, and Timo Aila. *Training Generative Adversarial Networks with Limited Data*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33:12104–12114, 2020.

- For the **Stock1K Dataset**, there is no specific citation provided in the references, as it is described as the authors' own collection.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or processing.
