To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HUGS: Human Gaussian Splats" by Muhammed Kocabas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used. In this case, the abstract does not mention specific datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, which is explicitly dedicated to the datasets used in the experiments. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the research.

In section 4.1, I find two datasets mentioned:

1. **NeuMan Dataset**: This dataset consists of six videos, each lasting between 10 to 20 seconds, featuring a single individual captured using a mobile phone. The sequences are named Seattle, Citron, Parking, Bike, Jogging, and Lab. The authors mention that they split the frames into 80% training, 10% validation, and 10% test frames.

2. **ZJU-MoCap Dataset**: This dataset includes videos of a human captured in a lab using a multi-view capture setup. The authors selected six subjects showcasing diverse motions and utilized images captured by "camera 1" for input, while the other 22 cameras were used for evaluation.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. 

- For the **NeuMan Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wei Jiang, Kwang Moo Yi, Golnoosh Samei, Oncel Tuzel, and Anurag Ranjan. *Neuman: Neural human radiance field from a single video*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2022.

- For the **ZJU-MoCap Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sida Peng, Yuanqing Zhang, Yinghao Xu, Qianqian Wang, Qing Shuai, Hujun Bao, and Xiaowei Zhou. *Neural body: Implicit neural representations with structured latent codes for novel view synthesis of dynamic humans*. In CVPR, 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the research paper.
