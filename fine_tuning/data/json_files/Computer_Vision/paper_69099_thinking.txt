To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contextual Feature Extraction Hierarchies Converge in Large Language Models and the Brain" by Gavin Mischler et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and I will look for any mention of datasets or data sources used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly **section 4.2 (Large Language Models)**, where the authors describe the models analyzed in the study. Here, they mention that they analyzed 12 open-source, pre-trained LLMs, all approximately 7 billion parameters in size. I will note the names of these models as they may be considered datasets in the context of this research.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide a summary of the models used along with their benchmark performance scores. I will extract the names of the models from this table, as they represent the datasets utilized for evaluating the performance of the LLMs.

The models listed in the table are:

1. **Galactica-6.7B**
2. **CerebrasGPT-6.7B**
3. **Pythia-6.9B**
4. **OPT-6.7B**
5. **FairseqDense-6.7B**
6. **LeoLM-7B**
7. **MPT-7B**
8. **Falcon-7B**
9. **LLaMA-7B**
10. **LLaMA2-7B**
11. **XwinLM-7B**
12. **Mistral-7B**

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for these models. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source for each dataset/model mentioned.

The citations for the models are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
