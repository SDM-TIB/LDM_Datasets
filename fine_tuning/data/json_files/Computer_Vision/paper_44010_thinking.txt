To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DUODEPTH: STATIC GESTURE RECOGNITION WITH DUAL DEPTH SENSORS" by Ilya Chugunov and Avideh Zakhor, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present a manually collected dataset of 20,100 point clouds, which suggests that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (DUODEPTH)**, particularly the **Data collection** subsection. Here, the authors describe the dataset in detail: they recorded gestures using two depth cameras, resulting in 1005 captures of ten different gestures, leading to a total of 20,100 point clouds. This section provides essential information about the dataset's structure and content.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they used this dataset to evaluate their methodologies, confirming its significance in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is manually collected by the authors and does not reference an external source, I will create a citation based on the information provided in the paper itself. The citation will include the authors, title, and a brief description of the dataset.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> Ilya Chugunov and Avideh Zakhor. *DUODEPTH: Static Gesture Recognition with Dual Depth Sensors*. Manually collected dataset of 20,100 point clouds for gesture recognition, 2019.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that it is ready for review or further processing.
