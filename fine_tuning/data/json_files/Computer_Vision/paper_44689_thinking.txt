To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Few-Shot Image Classification via Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning" by Jianyi Li and Guizhong Liu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions achieving state-of-the-art performance on a standardized benchmark in few-shot learning, which suggests that a specific dataset is likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of few-shot learning and the need for labeled data. They hint at using a standard few-shot visual classification dataset, which prompts me to look for specific names in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention using the **miniImageNet** dataset, which is a well-known benchmark in few-shot learning. The paper states that miniImageNet consists of 100 classes sampled from ImageNet, with each class containing 600 images.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the miniImageNet dataset, I will check the **references section** of the paper. The citation for miniImageNet is as follows:
> Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T., Wierstra, D., et al. "Matching networks for one shot learning." In Advances in neural information processing systems, 2016, pp. 3630â€“3638.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to using a larger dataset for meta-training, which they describe as consisting of 168 classes from ImageNet. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset, as it appears to be a custom selection from ImageNet.

Since the miniImageNet dataset is the only explicitly named dataset with a full citation, I will focus on documenting that.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the miniImageNet dataset as required. This will be ready for further processing or review.
