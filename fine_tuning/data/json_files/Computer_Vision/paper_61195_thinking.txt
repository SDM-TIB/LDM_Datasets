To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Latent Magic: An Investigation into Adversarial Examples Crafted in the Semantic Latent Space" by BoYang Zheng, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a pre-trained Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) from the Stable Diffusion Model, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** to find specific mentions of datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics. In this paper, the author mentions using the **validation set of ImageNet-1k** for their experiments, which is a significant dataset in the field of image classification.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The citation for ImageNet is typically as follows:
> Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the primary dataset used for the experiments is the ImageNet-1k validation set.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the ImageNet dataset in my output. This will provide a clear and comprehensive summary of the datasets referenced in the paper.
