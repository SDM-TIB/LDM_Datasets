To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Graph Modeling of Simultaneous EEG and Eye-Tracking Data for Reading Task Identification" by Puneet Mathur et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **ZuCo 2.0 dataset** for evaluating their method, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the **ZuCo 2.0 dataset** in the **experiments section**. Here, the authors describe the dataset as providing simultaneous EEG and eye-tracking data for 18 participants reading a total of 739 sentences, with a breakdown of sentences for normal reading and task-specific reading. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use in their experiments.

I will also check the **related work and methodology sections** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or referenced. However, the primary focus appears to be on the **ZuCo 2.0 dataset**, which is consistently referenced throughout the paper.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the **ZuCo 2.0 dataset**. The citation provided in the references is:

- **ZuCo 2.0 Dataset**: 
  > Nora Hollenstein, Marius Troendle, Ce Zhang, and Nicolas Langer. *ZuCo 2.0: A dataset of physiological recordings during natural reading and annotation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1912.00903, 2019.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the **ZuCo 2.0 dataset** to ensure it is ready for review or further processing.
