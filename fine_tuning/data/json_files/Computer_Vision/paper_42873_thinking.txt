To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Laplacian Denoising Autoencoder" by Jianbo Jiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on several visual benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their content or structure.

In the paper, the authors mention two datasets in Section 4.1 (Experimental Setup):

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits, with 60,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing. The images are of size 28x28 pixels.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 50,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing.

Additionally, the authors refer to the **ImageNet Dataset** in Section 4.4, which is a large-scale dataset consisting of 1.2 million images covering 1,000 categories. This dataset is used for training their model without labels.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

- For the **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. [http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

- For the **ImageNet Dataset**:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for further use or analysis. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured and properly attributed.
