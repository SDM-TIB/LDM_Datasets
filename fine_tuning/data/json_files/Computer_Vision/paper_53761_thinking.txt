To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-grained Image Captioning with CLIP Reward" by Jaemin Cho et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new dataset called **FineCapEval** for caption evaluation, which is a key dataset to note.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (FineCapEval: Fine-grained Caption Evaluation Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the FineCapEval dataset. They describe how this dataset was constructed, including the number of images and the criteria for annotation. Specifically, they mention that FineCapEval consists of 1,000 images collected from the **MS COCO** and **Conceptual Captions** datasets, with 5,000 annotations across four criteria.

In this section, I will extract the following details about the FineCapEval dataset:
- It contains 1,000 images.
- It includes annotations for four criteria: overall, background, object, and relations.
- The images were sourced from the **MS COCO** test2015 split and the **Conceptual Captions** validation split.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:
1. For **MS COCO**, the citation is:
   > Tsung Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr DollÃ¡r, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In ECCV, 2014.

2. For **Conceptual Captions**, the citation is:
   > Piyush Sharma, Nan Ding, Sebastian Goodman, and Radu Soricut. *Conceptual captions: A cleaned, hypernymed, image alt-text dataset for automatic image captioning*. In ACL, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:
- **FineCapEval**: A new dataset for fine-grained caption evaluation, consisting of 1,000 images and 5,000 annotations across four criteria.
- **MS COCO**: A widely used dataset for image captioning and object detection.
- **Conceptual Captions**: A dataset for automatic image captioning.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations for further processing or review.
