To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Representation Learning Beyond Node and Homophily" by You Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on a variety of benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention several datasets, including:

1. **Cora**: A standard citation network where nodes represent documents and edges are citation links. The features are represented as a bag-of-words of the documents.
   
2. **Citeseer**: Similar to Cora, this dataset consists of documents as nodes and citation links as edges, with bag-of-words features.

3. **Pubmed**: Another citation network with documents as nodes and citation links as edges, featuring bag-of-words representations.

4. **Cornell**: A dataset of web pages where nodes represent web pages and edges are hyperlinks. The pages are classified into categories such as student, project, course, staff, and faculty.

5. **Wisconsin**: Another webpage dataset similar to Cornell, with nodes as web pages and edges as hyperlinks.

6. **PPI**: A multi-layer dataset representing protein-protein interactions.

7. **DBLP**: A collaboration network dataset.

8. **Cuneiform**: A dataset for handwriting Hittite cuneiform signs.

9. **FFtwyt**: A social network dataset from Twitter and YouTube.

10. **FB15K-237**: A widely used knowledge graph with multi-label edges.

11. **WN18RR**: Another knowledge graph dataset with multi-label edges.

After identifying these datasets, I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, the citation for the **Cora dataset** is:
> McCallum, A., & Nigam, S. (2002). *A comparison of event models for Naive Bayes text classification*. In Proceedings of the AAAI-98 Workshop on Learning for Text Categorization (Vol. 752, pp. 41-48).

Similarly, I will look for citations for the other datasets mentioned, ensuring that I capture the correct authors, titles, publication venues, and years.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
