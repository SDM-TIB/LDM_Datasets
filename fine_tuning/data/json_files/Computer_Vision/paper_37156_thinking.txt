To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Coarse-to-Fine Indoor Layout Estimation (CFILE) Method" by Yuzhuo Ren et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two commonly used benchmark datasets. This indicates that datasets are indeed involved, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will look closely at the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In **Section 4.1**, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Hedau Dataset**: This dataset contains 209 training images, 53 validation images, and 105 test images. It is referenced as a foundational dataset for indoor layout estimation.

2. **LSUN Dataset**: This dataset consists of 4000 training images, 394 validation images, and 1000 test images. It is noted that the LSUN dataset provides semantic surface labels but not layout information.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Hedau Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hedau, V., Hoiem, D., & Forsyth, D. (2009). Recovering the spatial layout of cluttered rooms. In *Computer vision, 2009 IEEE 12th international conference on* (pp. 1849–1856). IEEE.

- For the **LSUN Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mallya, A., & Lazebnik, S. (2015). Learning informative edge maps for indoor scene layout prediction. In *Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision* (pp. 936–944).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Hedau Dataset**: A dataset for indoor layout estimation with specific training, validation, and test splits.
2. **LSUN Dataset**: A larger dataset that provides semantic surface labels.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
