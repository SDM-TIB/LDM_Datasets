To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Image Super-Resolution With Deep Variational Autoencoders" by Darius Chira et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but the experiments section is likely where the datasets are explicitly mentioned.

In the **experiments section (Section 5)**, the authors discuss both the training and test datasets. I will focus on this section to identify the datasets used in their study.

1. **Training Dataset**: The authors mention that they trained their models on the **DIV2K dataset**. They describe it as consisting of 800 RGB high-definition images for training, with additional images for validation and testing. This dataset is crucial for understanding the training process of their model.

2. **Test Datasets**: The authors list several datasets used for testing their method:
   - **Set5**: A commonly used benchmark dataset for single-image super-resolution.
   - **Set14**: Another popular dataset for evaluating super-resolution methods.
   - **Urban100**: A dataset focused on urban scenes.
   - **BSD100**: A dataset containing a variety of natural images.
   - **Manga109**: A dataset consisting of manga drawings.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is critical for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their full citations for reference.
