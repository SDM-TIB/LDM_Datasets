To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Diffusion EM: a diffusion model for blind inverse problems with application to deconvolution" by Charles Laroche et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of diffusion models for image restoration but does not specify any datasets. I will note this and move on.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is typically where datasets are explicitly mentioned. In section 4.1, the authors state that they tested their algorithm on the **FFHQ dataset** and the **DIV2K dataset**. This is a crucial finding, as it indicates that these datasets are used for evaluation.

I will then look for detailed descriptions of these datasets within the same section or in any other relevant sections. The authors mention that they used the **FFHQ dataset** for validation images and degraded them with random motion blur kernels. They also mention the **DIV2K dataset** but do not provide extensive details about it in this section.

To ensure I have the full citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. Here, I find the following citations:

- For the **FFHQ dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. *A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (CVPR), 2019.

- For the **DIV2K dataset**, the citation is:
  > Eirikur Agustsson and Radu Timofte. *Ntire 2017 challenge on single image super-resolution: Dataset and study*. In The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) Workshops, July 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **FFHQ Dataset**: Used for validation images in the experiments.
   - Citation: Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. *A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (CVPR), 2019.

2. **DIV2K Dataset**: Also mentioned as part of the experiments.
   - Citation: Eirikur Agustsson and Radu Timofte. *Ntire 2017 challenge on single image super-resolution: Dataset and study*. In The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) Workshops, July 2017.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries for further processing or review.
