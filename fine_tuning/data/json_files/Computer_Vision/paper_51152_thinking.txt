To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MViTv2: Improved Multiscale Vision Transformers for Classification and Detection" by Karttikeya Mangalam et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on **ImageNet**, **COCO**, and **Kinetics**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial to their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 5, the authors describe their experiments on **ImageNet-1K**, which contains approximately 1.28 million images across 1000 classes. They also mention using the **COCO dataset** for object detection, which consists of 118,000 training images and 5,000 validation images. Additionally, they refer to the **Kinetics dataset** for video recognition tasks, specifically Kinetics-400, Kinetics-600, and Kinetics-700.

I will also check the **appendix and references section** for full citations of these datasets. The references provide the necessary details for proper citation:

1. **ImageNet**:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255, 2009.

2. **COCO**:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollar, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

3. **Kinetics**:
   > Joao Carreira and Andrew Zisserman. *Quo vadis, action recognition? A new model and the kinetics dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- **ImageNet** with citation details.
- **COCO** with citation details.
- **Kinetics** with citation details.

This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the research paper.
