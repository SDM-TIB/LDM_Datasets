To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multilevel Diffusion: Infinite Dimensional Score-Based Diffusion Models for Image Generation" by Paul Hagemann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their approach on **MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets**, which indicates that these datasets are likely to be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly mention using the **MNIST** and **Fashion-MNIST** datasets for image generation tasks. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their size, structure, and any preprocessing steps taken.

In the experiments section, the authors state that they used the **MNIST dataset**, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits, and the **Fashion-MNIST dataset**, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of fashion items. This confirms the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 2010. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For the **Fashion-MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. 2017. Available at: https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
