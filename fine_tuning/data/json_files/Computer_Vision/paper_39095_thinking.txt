To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convex Covariate Clustering for Classification" by Daniel Andrade et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used in experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will note any datasets that are explicitly named. For instance, if the authors mention using the **IMDB dataset** or the **20 Newsgroups corpus**, I will take note of these names and any relevant details provided about them, such as the number of samples, features, or specific characteristics that are important for understanding their use in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for the original papers or sources where these datasets were introduced or described.

For example, if the authors mention the **IMDB dataset**, I will find the citation:
> Maas, A. L., Daly, R. E., Pham, P. T., Huang, D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2011). Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis. In Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 142â€“150.

Similarly, for the **20 Newsgroups corpus**, I will locate its citation:
> Rennie, J. D. M. (2006). 20 Newsgroups dataset. Retrieved from http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrennie/20newsgroups/

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, making it easier for others to understand and utilize the findings of the study.
