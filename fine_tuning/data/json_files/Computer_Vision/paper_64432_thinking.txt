To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Single and Few-Step Diffusion for Generative Speech Enhancement" by Bunlong Lay et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the study. In this case, the introduction mentions the objective of speech enhancement and references two datasets used for evaluation: **VoiceBank-DEMAND (VBD)** and **WSJ0-CHiME3 (WSJ0-C3)**.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** in the paper, which is typically where authors describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, section 4.6 explicitly discusses the datasets used for training and testing. Here, the authors provide specific information about each dataset:

1. **VoiceBank-DEMAND (VBD)**: This dataset is commonly used as a benchmark in single-channel speech enhancement tasks. The authors note that it does not have a validation set, so they split the training data into two sets for unbiased validation.

2. **WSJ0-CHiME3 (WSJ0-C3)**: This dataset mixes clean speech utterances from the Wall Street Journal dataset with noise signals from the CHiME3 dataset. The authors specify the number of files in the training, validation, and test sets.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The citations I need to extract are:

- For **VoiceBank-DEMAND**:
  > Valentini-Botinhao, C., Wang, X., Takaki, S., & Yamagishi, J. (2016). Investigating RNN-based speech enhancement methods for noise-robust text-to-speech. In ISCA Speech Synthesis Workshop (SSW), pp. 146–152.

- For **WSJ0-CHiME3**:
  > Barker, J., Marxer, R., Vincent, E., & Watanabe, S. (2015). The third CHiME speech separation and recognition challenge: Dataset, task and baselines. In IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding (ASRU), pp. 504–511.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
