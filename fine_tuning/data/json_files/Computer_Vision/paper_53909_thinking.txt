To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EfﬁcientNeRF: Efﬁcient Neural Radiance Fields" by Tao Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but I need to look for specific dataset names and descriptions.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Realistic Synthetic dataset**: This dataset contains 8 synthetic scenes, each with 100 training images and 200 testing images, all at a resolution of 800 × 800. This dataset is crucial for evaluating the performance of their proposed method.

2. **Real Forward-Facing dataset**: This dataset consists of 8 complex real-world scenes, with each scene containing between 20 to 62 images at a resolution of 1,008 × 756. This dataset is also used for testing the proposed method.

To confirm the details and obtain the full citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Realistic Synthetic dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P. Srinivasan, Matthew Tancik, Jonathan T. Barron, Ravi Ramamoorthi, and Ren Ng. *NeRF: Representing scenes as neural radiance fields for view synthesis*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 405–421, 2020.

- For the **Real Forward-Facing dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P. Srinivasan, Rodrigo Ortiz Cayon, Nima Khademi Kalantari, Ravi Ramamoorthi, Ren Ng, and Abhishek Kar. *Local light field fusion: practical view synthesis with prescriptive sampling guidelines*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
