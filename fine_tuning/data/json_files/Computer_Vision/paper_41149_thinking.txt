To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "Multi-Frame GAN: Image Enhancement for Stereo Visual Odometry in Low Light" by Eunah Jung et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their method on both synthetic and real datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention the use of the **New Tsukuba dataset** and the **Oxford RobotCar dataset** for their experiments. This is a strong indication that these datasets are crucial for understanding the evaluation of their proposed method.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **New Tsukuba Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a synthetic indoor dataset used for validation. I will need to find the full citation for this dataset in the references section.

2. **Oxford RobotCar Dataset**: This dataset is described as a real outdoor dataset collected over a year, containing various illumination situations. I will also look for its full citation in the references section.

Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **New Tsukuba dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Martull, M. Peris, and K. Fukui. *Realistic CG stereo image dataset with ground truth disparity maps*. In ICPR workshop TrakMark2012, volume 111, pages 117–118, 2012.

- For the **Oxford RobotCar dataset**, the citation is:
  > W. Maddern, G. Pascoe, C. Linegar, and P. Newman. *1 year, 1000 km: The Oxford RobotCar dataset*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, 36(1):3–15, 2017.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
