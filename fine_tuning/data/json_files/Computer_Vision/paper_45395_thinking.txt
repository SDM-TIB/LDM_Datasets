To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Geometry-Aware Hamiltonian VAE" by ClÃ©ment Chadebec et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, which can help identify them.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly any subsections that discuss datasets. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any preprocessing steps taken. I will look for explicit mentions of dataset names, as well as any relevant statistics or features that describe the datasets.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets in the context of the experiments conducted. For example, if the authors refer to datasets like "MNIST," "FashionMNIST," or any other specific datasets, I will note these down.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets easily.

For instance, if the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset**, I would find the citation that corresponds to it, which might look something like:
> Yann LeCun. The MNIST database of handwritten digits. 1998. URL http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

Similarly, if they mention the **FashionMNIST dataset**, I would look for its citation:
> Xiao, H., Rasul, K., & Vollgraf, R. (2017). Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's details.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the full citation, as this is essential for proper academic referencing and allows others to access the datasets used in the research.
