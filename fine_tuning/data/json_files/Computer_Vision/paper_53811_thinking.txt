To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Embedded Clustering with Distribution Consistency Preservation for Attributed Networks" by Yimei Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention that they validated their model on **eight real-world datasets** and several artificial attributed networks. I will look for a table or a list that summarizes these datasets, as it often contains key details.

Upon reviewing the text, I find that the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets in **Table 1** and **Table 2**. Hereâ€™s what I will extract:

1. **Real-world datasets**:
   - **Citeseer**: A citation network where nodes represent documents and edges represent citation relationships.
   - **Cora**: Another citation network similar to Citeseer.
   - **PubMed**: A dataset of medical papers with citation relationships.
   - **ACM**: A paper network where edges represent co-authorship.
   - **DBLP**: An author cooperation network.
   - **USPS**: A handwritten digit image dataset.
   - **HHAR**: A dataset containing sensor records from smart devices.
   - **Reuters**: A text dataset containing news stories.

2. **Artificial attributed networks**: These are generated using the LFR benchmark, and the authors describe the parameters used for generating these networks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are often included in the references, especially for well-known datasets like Citeseer, Cora, and PubMed.

For example, I will look for:
- **Citeseer** citation:
  > P. B. G. et al. "Citation Network Dataset." [Include full citation details here].
  
- **Cora** citation:
  > T. N. Kipf, M. Welling. "Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks." In Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2017.

- **PubMed** citation:
  > D. D. Lewis, Y. Yang, T. G. Rose, F. Li. "RCV1: A new benchmark collection for text categorization research." Journal of Machine Learning Research, 2004.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
