To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sets of autoencoders with shared latent spaces" by Vasily Morzhakov, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments and results**. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and subsequent sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the use of autoencoders and their applications but does not specify any datasets. I will then proceed to the **experiments section**, particularly looking for any mentions of datasets used for training or testing the models.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the author mentions conducting tests on the **MNIST dataset** in section 4 (Set of autoencoders). This dataset is crucial for the experiments described, as it serves as the basis for comparing the performance of autoencoders against traditional classification neural networks.

Next, I will look for the **full citation** of the MNIST dataset in the references section. The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, and its citation is typically standardized. However, I will confirm the citation provided in the references section of this paper.

The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Since the paper primarily focuses on the MNIST dataset for its experiments, I will document this dataset accordingly.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will allow for clear communication of the datasets used in the research.

In summary, I have identified the MNIST dataset as the primary dataset used in the experiments, and I have retrieved its full citation for documentation purposes.
