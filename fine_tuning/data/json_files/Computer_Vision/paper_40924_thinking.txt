To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mixup Inference: Better Exploiting Mixup to Defend Adversarial Attacks" by Tianyu Pang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments conducted on **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, indicating that these datasets are likely used in the study.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details. Here, the authors mention that their experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, confirming that these datasets are indeed central to their research.

I will then look at the **experiments section** (Section 4) to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or specific details about how CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 were utilized. The authors provide a comprehensive setup for their experiments, including the parameters used for training and testing on these datasets.

In the **references section**, I will locate the full citations for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

Since both datasets are from the same source, I will ensure to note that they are part of the same technical report.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
