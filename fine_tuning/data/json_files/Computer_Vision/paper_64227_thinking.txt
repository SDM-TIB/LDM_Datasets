To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Effective Real Image Editing with Accelerated Iterative Diffusion Inversion" by Zhihong Pan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on a "large 5000 image COCO test set," which indicates that the COCO dataset is one of the datasets used.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail. In **section 4.1 (Image Editing)**, the authors specify that they used the **AFHQ dataset** for image editing tasks, particularly for evaluating the performance of their proposed method in a dog-to-cat image editing scenario. This section provides a clear indication of the datasets utilized for their experiments.

In **section 4.2 (Reconstruction Accuracy)**, the authors confirm that they conducted a reconstruction test using the **COCO dataset**. This reinforces the earlier mention of COCO and highlights its significance in their evaluation process.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **COCO dataset**, the citation is:
   > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., Zitnick, C.L. "Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context." In: European conference on computer vision, Springer (2014) 740–755.

2. For the **AFHQ dataset**, the citation is:
   > Choi, Y., Uh, Y., Yoo, J., Ha, J.W. "StarGAN v2: Diverse image synthesis for multiple domains." In: Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. (2020) 8188–8197.

Having identified the datasets and their respective citations, I will now compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
