To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ConsistNet: Enforcing 3D Consistency for Multi-view Images Diffusion" by Jiayu Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for training or evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experiments section typically details the datasets employed in the study.

In the **experiments section (5.1)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Objaverse Dataset**: This dataset is described as a large-scale collection containing over 800,000 annotated 3D mesh objects. The authors explain that they filtered out samples with multiple objects and rendered 16 images per object from various viewpoints.

2. **Google Scanned Objects Dataset**: This dataset consists of over one thousand 3D-scanned household items. The authors indicate that they used this dataset solely for evaluation, rendering objects under specific elevation angles.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Objaverse Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Matt Deitke, Dustin Schwenk, Jordi Salvador, Luca Weihs, Oscar Michel, Eli VanderBilt, Ludwig Schmidt, Kiana Ehsani, Aniruddha Kembhavi, and Ali Farhadi. *Objaverse: A universe of annotated 3D objects*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 13142â€“13153, 2023.

- For the **Google Scanned Objects Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Anthony G. Francis, Brandon Kinman, Krista Ann Reymann, Laura Downs, Nathan Koenig, Ryan M. Hickman, Thomas B. McHugh, and Vincent Olivier Vanhoucke, editors. *Google Scanned Objects: A High-Quality Dataset of 3D Scanned Household Items*, 2022.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings and prepare to format them according to the required structure, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
