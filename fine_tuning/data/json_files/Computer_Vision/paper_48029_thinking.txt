To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Distant Metastases in Soft-Tissue Sarcomas from PET-CT scans using Constrained Hierarchical Multi-Modality Feature Learning" by Yige Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions using a "public PET-CT dataset of STS patients," which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **Methods section**. Here, the authors describe the dataset in detail, stating that it consists of 51 patients with histologically proven, extremity primary soft-tissue sarcomas. Each patient had multiple imaging modalities, including FDG PET, CT, and T1-weighted and T2-weighted MR scans. This section provides crucial information about the dataset's composition and purpose.

The authors also mention that the dataset is sourced from the **Cancer Imaging Archive**. This is an important detail that I need to note for the citation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The relevant citation for the Cancer Imaging Archive is:

- **Cancer Imaging Archive**: 
  > Clark, K., et al. "The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA): maintaining and operating a public information repository." *Journal of Digital Imaging*, vol. 26, no. 6, pp. 1045-1057, 2013.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Public PET-CT STS Dataset**: This dataset includes imaging data from 51 patients diagnosed with extremity primary soft-tissue sarcomas, featuring multiple imaging modalities (FDG PET, CT, T1-weighted, and T2-weighted MR scans). The dataset is used to predict distant metastases in STS patients.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that all relevant information is captured accurately and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
