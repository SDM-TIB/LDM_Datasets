To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Image Color Transformations in Explicit Color Filter Space" by Zhengyu Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations. The introduction often elaborates on the context of the research and may reference datasets that are critical to the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant splits (e.g., training, validation, testing).

In this paper, I will pay special attention to any references to datasets such as the **ImageNet-Compatible Dataset** and the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, as these are commonly used in adversarial machine learning research. I will note the specific details provided about these datasets, such as the number of images, categories, and any preprocessing steps mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. 

For example, if the paper mentions the **ImageNet-Compatible Dataset**, I will look for its citation, which may include the authors, title, publication venue, and year. Similarly, I will do the same for the **CIFAR-10 dataset** and any other datasets mentioned.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the information in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further, ensuring that all extracted datasets are clearly documented with their respective citations.
