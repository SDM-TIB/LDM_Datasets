To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HalluciNet-ing Spatiotemporal Representations Using a 2D-CNN" by Paritosh Parmar and Brendan Morris, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of spatiotemporal representations and hints at the datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. In **section 4.1**, they mention using the **UCF-101** and **HMDB-51** datasets for action recognition tasks. The UCF-101 dataset is noted for containing 101 human action classes, while HMDB-51 consists of 51 action categories.

In **section 4.2**, the authors introduce the **MTL-AQA dataset**, which is used for dive recognition and action quality assessment. This dataset has 1,059 training samples and 353 test samples, specifically designed for evaluating diving actions.

In **section 4.3**, they refer to the **YUP++ dataset** for dynamic scene recognition tasks, which has 20 scene classes and is used to evaluate the utility of inferred motion.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **UCF-101 Dataset**:

2. **HMDB-51 Dataset**:

3. **MTL-AQA Dataset**:
   > Paritosh Parmar and Brendan Tran Morris. *What and how well you performed? A multitask learning approach to action quality assessment*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 304–313, 2019.

4. **YUP++ Dataset**:
   > Christoph Feichtenhofer, Axel Pinz, and Richard P Wildes. *Temporal residual networks for dynamic scene recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 4728–4737, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for further processing or review.
