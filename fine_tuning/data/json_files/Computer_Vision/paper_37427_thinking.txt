To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Audio Source Separation with Discriminative Scattering Networks" by Pablo Sprechmann, Joan Bruna, and Yann LeCun, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a multi-resolution representation for source separation, but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide more context or specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) closely, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. In this section, the authors mention that they evaluated their methods on the **TIMIT corpus** for a multi-speaker setting. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the TIMIT corpus. The TIMIT dataset is a well-known dataset in speech processing, and its citation is as follows:
> Garofolo, J. S., Lamel, L. A., Fisher, W. M., Fiscus, J. G., & Pallett, D. S. (1993). *TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus*. Linguistic Data Consortium.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude my extraction process here. 

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that all necessary details are captured for future reference or analysis.
