To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heat Source Layout Optimization Using Automatic Deep Learning Surrogate and Multimodal Neighborhood Search Algorithm" by Jialiang Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used for training or testing.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe their experiments and data preparation. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their size, characteristics, and how they were generated or collected.

In this paper, the authors mention that they generated **30,000 training samples** and **5,000 test samples** for their experiments. I will note these details as they indicate the datasets used in the study.

I will also check the **results section** for any additional context about the datasets, such as their specific characteristics or how they were utilized in the experiments. The authors may provide insights into the data generation process or any specific attributes of the datasets that are relevant to the study.

After gathering information about the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works that are mentioned. This is crucial for providing proper attribution and context for the datasets used in the research.

In this case, the authors do not cite any external datasets but rather describe their own generated datasets. Therefore, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Training Dataset**: Consists of 30,000 samples generated randomly for training the deep learning model.
2. **Test Dataset**: Comprises 5,000 samples generated randomly for testing the performance of the trained model.

Since there are no external datasets cited, I will ensure to document the details of these generated datasets clearly in the final output.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant details, ensuring that the citations are complete and accurate.
