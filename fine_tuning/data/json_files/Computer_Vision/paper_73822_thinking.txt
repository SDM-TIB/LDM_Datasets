To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Capsule Enhanced Variational AutoEncoder for Underwater Image Reconstruction" by Rita Pucci and Niki Martinel, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted evaluations on **6 benchmark datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for training and validation. In this section, they describe the datasets as follows:

1. **LSUI Train-L split**: This dataset consists of 4500 underwater image pairs featuring a variety of underwater scenes, object categories, water types, and lighting conditions. It is used for fine-tuning the model.

2. **Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI)**: This dataset is referenced as a benchmark for validation, specifically the LSUI-L400 split, which includes underwater scenes based on different water types and lighting conditions.

3. **Enhancing Underwater Visual Perception (EUVP)**: This dataset contains paired and unpaired image samples of varying quality, used to validate models trained for underwater image enhancement.

4. **UFO-120**: This dataset includes 120 full-reference testing images collected from various oceanic explorations, used for comparison against ground truth images.

5. **Underwater Color Cast Set (UCCS)**: Comprising 300 genuine underwater images, this dataset is used to evaluate the model's ability to correct color casts.

6. **Underwater test dataset (U45)**: This dataset contains 45 raw underwater images acquired at different locations and depths, showcasing various degradation characteristics.

7. **Stereo Quantitative Underwater Image Dataset (SQUID)**: This dataset includes 57 raw underwater images, also used for assessing the quality of enhanced images.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
