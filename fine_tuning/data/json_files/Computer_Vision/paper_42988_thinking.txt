To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Iterative Context-Aware Graph Inference for Visual Dialog" by Dan Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **VisDial v0.9 and v1.0 datasets**, indicating that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on **VisDial v0.9** and **VisDial v1.0**. They provide details about the number of dialogs and QA pairs in each dataset, which confirms their significance in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **VisDial v0.9**, the citation is:
  > Abhishek Das, Satwik Kottur, Khushi Gupta, Avi Singh, Deshraj Yadav, Jose M. F. Moura, Devi Parikh, and Dhruv Batra. *Visual Dialog*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 326–335, 2017.

- For **VisDial v1.0**, the citation is:
  > Abhishek Das, Satwik Kottur, Khushi Gupta, Avi Singh, Deshraj Yadav, Jose M. F. Moura, Devi Parikh, and Dhruv Batra. *Visual Dialog v1.0: A New Dataset for Visual Dialog*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 326–335, 2017.

With the dataset names and their citations identified, I will now compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
