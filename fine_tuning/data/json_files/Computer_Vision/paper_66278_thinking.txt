To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GEC-DePenD: Non-Autoregressive Grammatical Error Correction with Decoupled Permutation and Decoding" by Konstantin Yakovlev et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **ConLL-2014** and **Write&Improve+LOCNESS** datasets, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for their evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and training stages)**, where the authors provide a detailed overview of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention several datasets:

1. **PIE Dataset**: A synthetic dataset constructed by Awasthi et al. (2019b) that contains 9,000,000 sentences with 100% errorful sentences. This dataset is used in Stage I of their training pipeline.

2. **cLang8 Dataset**: A distilled version of the Lang8 dataset, containing 2,372,119 sentences with 57.7% errorful sentences, used in Stage II.

3. **First Certificate in English (FCE)**: This dataset includes 28,350 error-coded sentences from English as a second language exams, with 62.5% errorful sentences, also used in Stage II.

4. **National University of Singapore Corpus of Learner English (NUCLE)**: Comprising over 50,000 annotated sentences from essays of undergraduate students learning English, with 37.4% errorful sentences, used in Stage II.

5. **Write&Improve+LOCNESS (W&I+L)**: This dataset has 34,308 sentences with 66.3% errorful sentences and is used in both Stage II and III.

6. **CoNLL-2014 Test Dataset**: Used for evaluation, this dataset is referenced in the context of the M2 scorer.

7. **W&I+L Dev and Test Sets**: These are also used for evaluation, with specific metrics mentioned.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
