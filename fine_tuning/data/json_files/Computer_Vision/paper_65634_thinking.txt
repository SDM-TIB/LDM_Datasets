To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reference-based Restoration of Digitized Analog Videotapes" by Lorenzo Agnolucci et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a synthetic dataset to train their model, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Proposed Approach)**, particularly **subsection 3.1 (Synthetic Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset generation process. They mention that they created a synthetic dataset based on high-quality videos from the Harmonic dataset, which consists of 26,392 frames corresponding to 40 clips. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

I will also look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. In the **supplementary material**, they provide additional details about the synthetic dataset, confirming its significance in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Harmonic dataset, which is referenced as [2]. The citation is as follows:
> Harmonic free 4K demo footage. https://www.harmonicinc.com/free-4k-demo-footage/, 2019.

Since the authors do not mention any other datasets explicitly used in their experiments, I will focus on documenting the synthetic dataset derived from the Harmonic dataset.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. The dataset entry will highlight its purpose, the number of frames, and the source of the original videos.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise dataset entry ready for further use or analysis.
