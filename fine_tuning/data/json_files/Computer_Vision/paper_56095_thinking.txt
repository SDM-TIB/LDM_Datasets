To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NeRF2Real: Sim2real Transfer of Vision-guided Bipedal Motion Skills using Neural Radiance Fields" by Arunkumar Byravan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for training or evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss related work and may reference datasets that are foundational to their research. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to previous works that might include datasets.

I will then examine the **methodology** section, particularly any subsections that detail the experimental setup or data collection processes. This section is likely to contain specific information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention several datasets related to their work:
1. **Matterport3D**: This dataset is referenced as a source for learning from RGB-D data in indoor environments. It is crucial for understanding the context of the experiments conducted.
2. **Gibson**: Another dataset mentioned for real-world perception for embodied agents, which is relevant for simulating environments.
3. **Replica**: This dataset is noted for providing a digital replica of indoor spaces, which is essential for the authors' approach to simulating environments.
4. **Habitat-Matterport3D**: This dataset is also referenced, indicating its use in the context of the experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
