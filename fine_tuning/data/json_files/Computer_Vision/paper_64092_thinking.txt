To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ArSDM: Colonoscopy Images Synthesis with Adaptive Refinement Semantic Diffusion Models" by Yuhao Du et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the importance of annotated data for colonoscopy analysis and hints at the use of datasets for experiments. The introduction elaborates on the challenges of data scarcity in medical imaging, which suggests that the authors likely utilized specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the provided text, the authors mention conducting experiments on five public polyp segmentation datasets: **EndoScene**, **CVC-ClinicDB**, **CVC-ColonDB**, **ETIS**, and **Kvasir**. This is a crucial finding as it directly identifies the datasets used in their research.

Now, I will gather detailed information about each dataset, including their characteristics and any relevant citations. I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. 

1. **EndoScene**: The citation is:
   > Vázquez, D., Bernal, J., Sánchez, F.J., Fernández-Esparrach, G., López, A.M., Romero, A., Drozdzal, M., Courville, A. *A benchmark for endoluminal scene segmentation of colonoscopy images*. Journal of Healthcare Engineering, 2017.

2. **CVC-ClinicDB**: The citation is:
   > Bernal, J., Sánchez, F.J., Fernández-Esparrach, G., Gil, D., Rodríguez, C., Vilariño, F. *Wm-dova maps for accurate polyp highlighting in colonoscopy: Validation vs. saliency maps from physicians*. Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics, 2015.

3. **CVC-ColonDB**: The citation is:
   > Tajbakhsh, N., Gurudu, S.R., Liang, J. *Automated polyp detection in colonoscopy videos using shape and context information*. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 2016.

4. **ETIS**: The citation is:
   > Silva, J., Histace, A., Romain, O., Dray, X., Granado, B. *Toward embedded detection of polyps in WCE images for early diagnosis of colorectal cancer*. International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery, 2014.

5. **Kvasir**: The citation is:
   > Jha, D., Smedsrud, P.H., Riegler, M.A., Halvorsen, P., de Lange, T., Johansen, D., Johansen, H.D. *Kvasir-seg: A segmented polyp dataset*. In: MultiMedia Modeling: 26th International Conference, MMM 2020, Daejeon, South Korea, January 5–8, 2020, Proceedings, Part II. Springer, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
