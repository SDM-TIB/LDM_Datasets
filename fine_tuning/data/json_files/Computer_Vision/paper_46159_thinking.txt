To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Deep Recurrent Neural Network based Method for Fault Detection and Diagnosis" by Piyush Agarwala et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed algorithm is tested on the **Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP)**, which indicates that this is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges of fault detection and diagnosis in industrial processes, specifically referencing the TEP as a benchmark problem. This suggests that the TEP dataset is central to their experiments.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for details about how the TEP dataset is utilized. The authors describe that the TEP simulation contains 20 different fault scenarios and that the data is organized into a vector of measurements taken every 3 minutes. They also mention that the dataset can be downloaded from a specific URL, which is crucial for citation purposes.

In the **results section**, the authors present comparisons of their method using the TEP dataset against other methods, further confirming its importance in their study.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the Tennessee Eastman Process dataset from the references section. The relevant citation is:

- **Tennessee Eastman Process**: 
  > Downs, J.J., & Vogel, E.F. (1993). *A plant-wide industrial process control problem*. Computers & Chemical Engineering, 17(3), 245-255.

Finally, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset:

1. **Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP)**: This dataset is used for testing the proposed fault detection and diagnosis algorithm. It includes 20 different fault scenarios and is a standard benchmark in process systems research. The data can be accessed at the following URL: http://depts.washington.edu/control/LARRY/TE/download.html.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that the dataset entry is structured correctly for any further processing or review.
