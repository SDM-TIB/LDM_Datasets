To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised 3D Pose Estimation with Non-Rigid Structure-from-Motion Modeling" by Haorui Ji et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In this case, it states that the proposed method is evaluated on "mainstream datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically section 4.1), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Human3.6M**: This dataset contains various types of human motion sequences annotated with 3D ground truth extracted using motion capture systems. It includes a 17-joint skeleton and specifies which subjects are used for training and testing.

2. **MPI-INF-3DHP**: This dataset features more complex scenarios, including indoor and outdoor scenes, and includes activities performed by multiple actors. The authors mention the training and testing sets, which is crucial for understanding how the dataset is utilized.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For **Human3.6M**, the citation is:
> Ionescu, C., Papava, D., Olaru, V., & Sminchisescu, C. (2013). Human3.6M: Large scale datasets and predictive methods for 3D human sensing in natural environments. *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*, 36(7), 1325-1339.

For **MPI-INF-3DHP**, the citation is:
> Mehta, D., Rhodin, H., Casas, D., Fua, P., Sotnychenko, O., Xu, W., & Theobalt, C. (2017). Monocular 3D human pose estimation in the wild using improved CNN supervision. In *2017 International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV)* (pp. 506-516). IEEE.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This step-by-step approach ensures that I accurately capture the necessary details about each dataset used in the research.
