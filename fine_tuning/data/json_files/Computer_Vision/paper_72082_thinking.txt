To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion Assisted Image Reconstruction in Optoacoustic Tomography" by Martín G. González et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methods** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and validation. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using a dataset containing synthetic and experimental retinal vasculature phantoms from public databases. I will note the specific datasets mentioned:

1. **DRIVE**: Digital retinal images for vessel extraction.
2. **ARIA**: Automated retinal image analysis.
3. **RITE**: Retinal images vessel tree extraction.
4. **STARE**: Structured analysis of the retina.
5. **Hatamizadeh et al. (2022)**: This reference likely pertains to a specific dataset or methodology related to retinal imaging.

I will then check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- **DRIVE**: 
  > DRIVE (2020). Digital retinal images for vessel extraction.

- **ARIA**: 
  > ARIA (2006). Automated retinal image analysis.

- **RITE**: 
  > RITE (2013). Retinal images vessel tree extraction.

- **STARE**: 
  > STARE (2000). Structured analysis of the retina.

- **Hatamizadeh et al. (2022)**: 
  > Hatamizadeh, A., Hosseini, H., Patel, N., Choi, J., Pole, C., Hoeferlin, C., Schwartz, S., and Terzopoulos, D. (2022). RAVIR: A dataset and methodology for the semantic segmentation and quantitative analysis of retinal arteries and veins in infrared reflectance imaging. IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
