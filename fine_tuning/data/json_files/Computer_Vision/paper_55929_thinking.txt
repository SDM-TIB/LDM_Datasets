To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structure-Aware NeRF without Posed Camera via Epipolar Constraint" by Shu Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on various scenes, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they state that they evaluated their method on the **LLFF Dataset** and the **ScanNet Dataset**. 

1. **LLFF Dataset**: The authors describe it as consisting of eight scenes captured with a handheld cellphone, with each scene containing 20-62 images. They also mention the resolution of the images and the preprocessing steps taken, such as resizing the images.

2. **ScanNet Dataset**: The authors indicate that they selected eight scenes from this dataset, with 40 images chosen from each scene to cover a local region. They also mention that the images were resized for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **LLFF Dataset**, the citation is:
  > B. Mildenhall, P. P. Srinivasan, M. Tancik, J. T. Barron, R. Ramamoorthi, and R. Ng. "NeRF: Representing scenes as neural radiance fields for view synthesis." In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 405-421, 2020.

- For the **ScanNet Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Dai, A. X. Chang, M. Savva, M. Halber, T. Funkhouser, and M. Niesner. "ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 5828-5839, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
