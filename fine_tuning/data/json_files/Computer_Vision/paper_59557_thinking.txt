To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model-free Hedging of Impermanent Loss in Geometric Mean Market Makers" by Masaaki Fukasawa, Basile Maire, and Marcus Wunsch, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and may mention datasets used for simulations or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for simulations or analyses. In this paper, the authors mention using historical Bitcoin/USD index-price data from BitMEX, which is crucial for their simulation experiments.

I will look for specific details about the dataset, such as the time period covered, the frequency of data points, and any relevant characteristics. In this case, the authors state that the dataset consists of historical price data from November 1, 2020, to August 10, 2021, with 200,000 observations at 30-second intervals.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors mention that the data is publicly available from BitMEX, so I will note that as the source.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> BitMEX data available at http://public.bitmex.com

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset in a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring it is clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
