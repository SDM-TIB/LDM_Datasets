To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can an Embodied Agent Find Your 'Cat-shaped Mug'? LLM-Guided Exploration for Zero-Shot Object Navigation" by Vishnu Sashank Dorbala et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of RoboTHOR for evaluating the proposed method, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors describe their experimental setup and mention that they use the RoboTHOR validation set, which contains 1800 validation episodes across 15 environments. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

In addition, I will check the **related work section** for any other datasets that might be referenced indirectly. The authors mention other works that utilize datasets like ImageNet and OpenImages, but these are not the primary focus of their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **RoboTHOR**: The citation for RoboTHOR is:
   > Deitke, M., Han, W., Herrasti, A., Kembhavi, A., Kolve, E., Mottaghi, R., Salvador, J., Schwenk, D., VanderBilt, E., Wallingford, M., Weihs, L., Yatskar, M., & Farhadi, A. (2020). *RoboTHOR: An Open Simulation-to-Real Embodied AI Platform*. 

2. **ImageNet**: The citation for ImageNet is:
   > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 248–255.

3. **OpenImages**: The citation for OpenImages is:
   > Kuznetsova, A., Rom, H., Alldrin, N., Uijlings, J., Krasin, I., Pont-Tuset, J., Kamali, S., Popov, S., Malloci, M., Kolesnikov, A., et al. (2020). *The Open Images Dataset V4: Unified Image Classification, Object Detection, and Visual Relationship Detection at Scale*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 128(7), 1956–1981.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
