To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Weakly Supervised Causal Representation Learning" by Johann Brehmer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their methods on a novel dataset of simulated robotic manipulation, which suggests that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their experiments and mention the **CausalCircuit dataset**, which is a new dataset they introduced for their experiments. They provide details about the dataset, including its structure and how it was generated.

I will also check the **related work and references sections** to see if any existing datasets are cited. The authors mention using the **Causal3DIdent dataset**, which is referenced in the context of their experiments. 

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset:

1. **CausalCircuit Dataset**: This dataset consists of images generated from a robotic arm interacting with a system of lights. The authors describe how the dataset was created using the MuJoCo simulator and detail the causal relationships within the dataset.

2. **Causal3DIdent Dataset**: This dataset contains images of three-dimensional objects under various conditions, used to evaluate the authors' methods. The authors reference the original work that introduced this dataset.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets and their citations, ready for further processing or review.
