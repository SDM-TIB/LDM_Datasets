To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-Modal Concept Learning and Inference for Vision-Language Models" by Yi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors mention that they adopt the few-shot evaluation protocol on **11 widely-used image classification datasets** and provide a table summarizing the statistics of these datasets.

I will carefully examine **Table 1**, which lists the datasets along with their classes, training sizes, testing sizes, and tasks. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Caltech101**: 100 classes, 4,128 training images, 2,465 testing images, used for object recognition.
2. **DTD (Describable Textures Dataset)**: 47 classes, 2,820 training images, 1,692 testing images, used for texture recognition.
3. **EuroSAT**: 10 classes, 13,500 training images, 8,100 testing images, used for satellite image recognition.
4. **FGVCAircraft**: 100 classes, 3,334 training images, 3,333 testing images, used for fine-grained aircraft recognition.
5. **Flowers102**: 102 classes, 4,093 training images, 2,463 testing images, used for fine-grained flowers recognition.
6. **Food101**: 101 classes, 50,500 training images, 30,300 testing images, used for fine-grained food recognition.
7. **ImageNet**: 1,000 classes, 1.28M training images, 50,000 testing images, used for object recognition.
8. **OxfordPets**: 37 classes, 2,944 training images, 3,669 testing images, used for fine-grained pets recognition.
9. **StanfordCars**: 196 classes, 6,509 training images, 8,041 testing images, used for fine-grained car recognition.
10. **SUN397**: 397 classes, 15,880 training images, 19,850 testing images, used for scene recognition.
11. **UCF101**: 101 classes, 7,639 training images, 3,783 testing images, used for action recognition.

Additionally, the authors mention four datasets used for domain generalization:

1. **ImageNet-V2**: 10,000 testing images.
2. **ImageNet-Sketch**: 50,000 testing images.
3. **ImageNet-A**: 7,500 testing images.
4. **ImageNet-R**: 30,000 testing images.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:
