To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Minimax Estimation of Neural Net Distance" by Kaiyi Ji and Yingbin Liang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and prior work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their experiments, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study.

If the paper includes a **results or experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any references to datasets used for validation or testing of the proposed methods. This section often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their sizes, types, and any preprocessing steps taken.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called "CIFAR-10," I would look for the original citation, which might be something like:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: A Benchmark in Machine Learning*. 2009.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will format the extracted information in a structured manner, ready for further processing or review.
