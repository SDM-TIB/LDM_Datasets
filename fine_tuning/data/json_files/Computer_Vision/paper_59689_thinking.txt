To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MindDiffuser: Controlled Image Reconstruction from Human Brain Activity with Semantic and Structural Diffusion" by Yizhuo Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on the **Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD)**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention the **Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD)**, describing it as the largest neuroimaging dataset bridging brain and artificial intelligence, consisting of densely sampled fMRI data from 8 subjects. They provide specific details about the dataset, including the number of image stimuli and fMRI trials, which confirms its significance in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the NSD. The citation is as follows:
> Emily J Allen, Ghislain St-Yves, Yihan Wu, Jesse L Breedlove, Jacob S Prince, Logan T Dowdle, Matthias Nau, Brad Caron, Franco Pestilli, Ian Charest, et al. *A massive 7T fMRI dataset to bridge cognitive neuroscience and artificial intelligence*. Nature neuroscience, 25(1):116â€“126, 2022.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information for the NSD:

1. **Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD)**: This dataset consists of densely sampled fMRI data from 8 subjects, with each subject viewing 9000-10000 different natural scenes during MRI scanning sessions. The dataset includes 8859 image stimuli for training and 982 for testing, with a total of 24980 fMRI trials.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included as it is crucial for proper attribution.
