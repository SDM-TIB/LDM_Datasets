To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prior Mismatch and Adaptation in PnP-ADMM with a Nonconvex Convergence Analysis" by Shirin Shoushtari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets used for experiments. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets, which can help in understanding their relevance.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. This is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments, including details such as the number of samples, types of data, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study.

In this paper, I notice that the authors mention several datasets in the context of their experiments. Specifically, they refer to:

1. **BreCaHAD Dataset**: This dataset is used for training the denoisers and is described as containing breast cancer histopathological images. The authors mention that it is adapted to the target distribution in their experiments.

2. **MetFaces Dataset**: This dataset is used as a target distribution for the experiments. It consists of facial images and is crucial for evaluating the performance of the proposed methods.

3. **CelebA Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned as a source for training denoisers. It contains a large number of celebrity images with various attributes.

4. **RxRx1 Dataset**: This dataset is used in the context of evaluating the performance of the methods on a different type of data, specifically for image super-resolution tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **BreCaHAD Dataset**:

- **MetFaces Dataset**:

  > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015, 1-9.

- **RxRx1 Dataset**:
  > Sypetkowski, M., Rezanejad, M., Saberian, S., Kraus, O., Urbanik, J., Taylor, J., Mabey, B., Victors, J., Yosinski, J., Rezazadeh Sereshkeh, A., et al. (2023). *RxRx1: A dataset for evaluating experimental batch correction methods*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023, 4284-4293.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
