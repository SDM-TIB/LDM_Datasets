To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mammographic Breast Positioning Assessment via Deep Learning" by Toygar Tanyel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on mammography positioning, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide more context or references to datasets used in the study.

Next, I will examine the **Materials** section, specifically **subsection 2.1 (Study Sample)**, where the authors describe the dataset they used. Here, they mention the **VinDr Mammography dataset**, which is an open-access collection of 5000 exams from two hospitals in Vietnam. They selected 1000 exams, each with two MLO view mammograms, totaling 2000 images. This section provides detailed information about how the dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

In this subsection, the authors classify the MLO-view positioning in the dataset as 967 good and 633 poor for training, 108 good and 92 poor for validation, and 123 good and 77 poor for testing. This classification is important for understanding the dataset's application in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the VinDr Mammography dataset in the **References section**. The relevant citation is:

- **VinDr Mammography dataset**:
  > Nguyen, H.T., Nguyen, H.Q., Pham, H.H., Lam, K., Le, L.T., Dao, M., Vu, V. *Vindr-mammo: A large-scale benchmark dataset for computer-aided diagnosis in full-field digital mammography*. Scientific Data 10(1), 277 (2023).

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the VinDr Mammography dataset, ensuring that it is ready for any further processing or review.
