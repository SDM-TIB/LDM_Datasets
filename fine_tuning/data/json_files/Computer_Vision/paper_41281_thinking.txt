To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "ACE: Adaptive Confusion Energy for Natural World Data Distribution" by Yen-Chi Hsu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on datasets with fine-grained and long-tailed characteristics, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention several datasets:

1. **CUB-200-2011**: This dataset is a standard fine-grained visual classification dataset containing images of birds, specifically designed for fine-grained classification tasks.

2. **Stanford Cars**: This dataset consists of images of cars, also used for fine-grained classification, where the goal is to distinguish between different car models.

3. **FGVC-Aircraft**: This dataset includes images of various aircraft, another fine-grained classification dataset.

4. **ImageNet-LT**: This dataset is a long-tailed version of the ImageNet dataset, which is used to evaluate the performance of models on imbalanced data distributions.

5. **CUB-LT**: A long-tailed version of the CUB dataset, which combines fine-grained and long-tailed characteristics.

6. **iNaturalist 2018**: This dataset is known for its challenging classification tasks due to its long-tailed distribution and fine-grained categories.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CUB-200-2011**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
