To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PoincarÃ© Wasserstein Autoencoder" by Ivan Ovinnikov, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions demonstrating the model on a **synthetic dataset** and evaluating it on a **graph link prediction task**, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the author describes various experiments conducted. In **subsection 5.1**, the author discusses a dataset of **synthetically generated noisy binary trees**. This dataset is explicitly described, including how it was generated and the parameters used.

In **subsection 5.2**, the author mentions using the **MNIST dataset** for generating digits, which is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community. This is another dataset that needs to be documented.

In **subsection 5.3**, the author refers to three citation network datasets: **Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed**. These datasets are used for the link prediction task and are crucial to include in the dataset extraction.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset is generated by the authors, so it does not have a formal citation. However, I will document its description as provided in the paper.

2. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

3. **Cora Dataset**: The citation for the Cora dataset is:
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93.

4. **Citeseer Dataset**: The citation for the Citeseer dataset is:
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93.

5. **Pubmed Dataset**: The citation for the Pubmed dataset is:
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the MNIST, Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed datasets, while also providing a description for the synthetic dataset generated by the authors.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or processing.
