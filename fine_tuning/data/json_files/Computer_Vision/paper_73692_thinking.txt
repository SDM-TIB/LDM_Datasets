To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond Conventional Parametric Modeling: Data-Driven Framework for Estimation and Prediction of Time Activity Curves in Dynamic PET Imaging" by Niloufar Zakariaei et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a data-driven framework for estimating Time-Activity Curves (TACs) in Dynamic PET imaging, which suggests that datasets related to PET imaging might be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention specific datasets or provide context about the data they used. The introduction discusses the limitations of traditional compartmental modeling and emphasizes the need for a more flexible approach, but it does not specify datasets yet.

Moving on to **section 3 (Training the network and Dataset)**, the authors explicitly mention that they used a dataset from **7 male patients undergoing [18F]DCFPyL imaging for prostate cancer**. This is a crucial finding as it indicates the dataset's context and application.

I will note the details provided about the dataset, including the average age, weight, and administered dose of the patients, as this information is relevant for understanding the dataset's characteristics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. However, since the dataset is derived from a specific imaging study rather than a standalone dataset published in a separate paper, I will not find a formal citation for it. Instead, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

- **Dataset**: [18F]DCFPyL imaging dataset
  - **Description**: A dataset comprising images from 7 male patients undergoing [18F]DCFPyL imaging for prostate cancer, with an average age of 70.29 ± 1.89 years, mean weight of 93.71 ± 18.20 kg, and an average administered dose of 7.08 ± 1.31 mCi.

Since this dataset is not formally cited in the references, I will note that it is based on the authors' own data collection from their study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include all relevant details about the dataset as described in the paper.
