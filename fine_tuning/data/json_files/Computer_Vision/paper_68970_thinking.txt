To extract datasets from the research paper titled "No Longer Trending on Artstation: Prompt Analysis of Generative AI Art" by Jon McCormack et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction outlines the context and significance of the research, which may hint at the datasets used.

In the **datasets section**, the authors explicitly list the datasets they utilized for their analysis. Here, I will carefully note the names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics provided for each dataset.

The paper mentions three datasets:

1. **DiffusionDB**: This dataset contains 14 million images generated by Stable Diffusion, along with 1.8 million unique prompts and hyperparameters. It was collected over a two-week period in August 2022 and is publicly available at: https://poloclub.github.io/diffusiondb.

2. **Midjourney 2022 Discord dataset**: This dataset consists of 248,000 prompts and their associated generated images, obtained by scraping ten public Discord channels over 28 days in June 2022. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Turc, I., & Nemade, G. (2022). *Midjourney user prompts & generated images (250k)*. https://doi.org/10.34740/KAGGLE/DS/2349267.

3. **Midjourney 2023 dataset**: This dataset includes 2.84 million prompts and associated generated images, collected by scraping public Discord channels over 16 days in October-November 2023. The authors created this dataset, and the citation is:
   > McCormack, J., Rodriguez, M.T.L., Krol, S., & Rajcic, N. (2024). *Midjourney 2023 Dataset*. https://doi.org/10.26180/25038404.v1.

Next, I will verify the details of each dataset by cross-referencing with the **References section** to ensure that I have the correct citations and any additional information that may be relevant.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and accuracy in the extraction process.
