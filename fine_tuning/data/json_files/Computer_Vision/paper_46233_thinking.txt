To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "COVID-19 Detection in Chest X-Ray Images using a New Channel Boosted CNN" by Saddam Hussain Khan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset details sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on three different datasets of chest X-rays, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset Details)**, where the authors describe the datasets they assembled. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **CoV-Healthy-6k Dataset**: This dataset consists of 3,224 images collected from COVID-19 infected and healthy individuals. The images are sourced from publicly accessible repositories and verified by radiologists.

2. **CoV-NonCoV-10k Dataset**: This dataset includes a total of 9,538 images, comprising both COVID-19 infected and non-COVID-19 chest X-ray images. The non-COVID-19 images include healthy individuals and those with other infections.

3. **CoV-NonCoV-15k Dataset**: This is an augmented version of the CoV-NonCoV-10k dataset, containing 15,127 images, with 5,223 from COVID-19 infected individuals and 9,904 from non-COVID-19 individuals.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the sources of their datasets, specifically mentioning:

- For the **CoV-Healthy-6k Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Walid El-Shafai and Fathi Abd El-Samie. *Mendeley Data - Extensive COVID-19 X-Ray and CT Chest Images Dataset*. [Online]. Available: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/8h65ywd2jr/3. [Accessed: 26-Nov-2020].

- For the **Kaggle repository** used in the **CoV-Healthy-6k Dataset** and **CoV-NonCoV-10k Dataset**, the citation is:
  > COVID-19 Xray Dataset (Train & Test Sets) | Kaggle. [Online]. Available: https://www.kaggle.com/khoongweihao/covid19-xray-dataset-train-test-sets. [Accessed: 26-Nov-2020].

- The **CoV-NonCoV-10k Dataset** and **CoV-NonCoV-15k Dataset** also reference the same sources as above.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as presented in the paper.
