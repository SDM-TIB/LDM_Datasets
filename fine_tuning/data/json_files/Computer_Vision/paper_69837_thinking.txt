To extract datasets from the research paper titled "INSTRUCTIR: A Benchmark for Instruction Following of Information Retrieval Models" by Hanseok Oh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets. The abstract mentions the introduction of a novel benchmark called **INSTRUCTIR**, which suggests that there may be datasets associated with this benchmark.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (The INSTRUCTIR Benchmark)**, where the authors describe the data creation pipeline. Here, they mention that they collected a total of **9,906 instance-wise instructions** that involve various user-aligned instructions tailored to specific queries. This indicates that the INSTRUCTIR benchmark itself is a dataset.

In the same section, the authors reference the **MSMARCO dataset** as a seed dataset used for generating instructions. They state that they selected **1,743 queries** and corresponding target texts from the MSMARCO dataset, which is crucial for understanding the context of the instructions generated.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **INSTRUCTIR Dataset**: Since this is a novel benchmark introduced by the authors, I will cite it as follows:
   > Hanseok Oh, Hyunji Lee, Seonghyeon Ye, Haebin Shin, Hansol Jang, Changwook Jun, and Minjoon Seo. *INSTRUCTIR: A Benchmark for Instruction Following of Information Retrieval Models*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM), 2023.

2. **MSMARCO Dataset**: The citation for the MSMARCO dataset is:
   > Tri Nguyen, Mir Rosenberg, Xia Song, Jianfeng Gao, Saurabh Tiwary, Rangan Majumder, and Li Deng. *MS MARCO: A Human-Generated Machine Reading Comprehension Dataset*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the key aspects of each dataset, including their purpose and relevance to the research.

In summary, I have identified two datasets from the paper: the **INSTRUCTIR dataset** and the **MSMARCO dataset**, and I have noted their full citations for proper referencing.
