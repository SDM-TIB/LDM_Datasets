To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Confronting Ambiguity in 6D Object Pose Estimation via Score-Based Diffusion on SE(3)" by Tsu-Ching Hsiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new synthetic dataset called **SYMSOL-T** and the use of a real-world dataset called **T-LESS**. This indicates that there are at least two datasets to consider.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **methodology** and **experimental results sections**. In the methodology section, the authors describe the **SYMSOL-T dataset** as an enhancement of the original **SYMSOL dataset**, which contains 250,000 images of five symmetric, texture-less objects. Each object is subjected to random rotations, and the dataset is structured with 45,000 training images and 5,000 testing images.

The authors also mention the **T-LESS dataset**, which consists of 30 texture-less industrial objects and includes 50,000 training images from synthetic sources and 37,000 images from real-world scans. The testing set comprises 10,000 real-world scanned images.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

1. **SYMSOL Dataset**: The original dataset is referenced in the paper by Kieran A. Murphy et al. as follows:
   > Murphy, K. A., Esteves, C., Jampani, V., Ramalingam, S., & Makadia, A. (2021). Implicit-PDF: Non-parametric representation of probability distributions on the rotation manifold. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), pages 7882–7893.

2. **T-LESS Dataset**: The citation for the T-LESS dataset is:
   > Hodan, T., Haluza, P., Obdrzalek, S., Matas, J., & Lourakis, M. (2017). T-LESS: An RGB-D dataset for 6D pose estimation of texture-less objects. In Proceedings of the IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), pages 880–888.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while providing proper citations for each.
