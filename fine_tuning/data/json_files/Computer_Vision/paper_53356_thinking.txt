To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Neighborhood Search based on Neural Construction Heuristics" by Jonas K. Falkner et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses a Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) approach for solving the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW), but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look further into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **evaluation** section, specifically **section 3**, where the authors report results of their solver in the VRPTW-track of the DIMACS VRP Challenge. This section is likely to contain information about the datasets used for evaluation. The authors mention achieving results on various instance types, but I need to confirm if specific datasets are cited.

In the evaluation section, the authors refer to benchmarks from the **Solomon** and **Homberger & Gehring** datasets. These are well-known datasets in the vehicle routing problem community, and I will need to find their full citations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets. The references may not directly cite the datasets but could reference the original papers that introduced them.

1. **Solomon Benchmark**: The Solomon benchmark is widely used for evaluating vehicle routing algorithms. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Solomon, M. M. (1987). *Algorithms for the Vehicle Routing and Scheduling Problems with Time Window Constraints*. Operations Research, 35(2), 254-265.

2. **Homberger & Gehring Benchmark**: This benchmark is another standard dataset for vehicle routing problems. The citation is:
   > Homberger, J., & Gehring, H. (2000). *Two evolutionary metaheuristics for the vehicle routing problem*. In Proceedings of the 2000 Congress on Evolutionary Computation (Vol. 1, pp. 1-7). IEEE.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its full citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work or analyses.
