To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PAEDID: Patch Autoencoder Based Deep Image Decomposition For Pixel-level Defective Region Segmentation" by Shancong Mou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on an industrial dataset, which suggests that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors reference the **BTAD dataset** (Mishra et al. 2021) and the **ELPV dataset** (Deitsch et al. 2021) as part of their experiments. This is a strong indication that these datasets are crucial for their research.

In the **case study section**, the authors provide more details about the datasets used. They mention that the BTAD dataset contains inspection images of two products and that the ELPV dataset consists of grayscale images of normal and defective solar cells. This confirms the datasets' relevance and provides context for their application.

I will then check the **data availability statement** and **references section** to gather the full citations for each dataset. The references provide the necessary details for proper citation:

1. **BTAD Dataset**:
   > Mishra, P., Verk, R., Fornasier, D., Piciarelli, C., & Foresti, G. L. (2021). "VT-ADL: A vision transformer network for image anomaly detection and localization." arXiv preprint arXiv:2104.10036. Available at: https://github.com/pankajmishra000/VT-ADL

2. **ELPV Dataset**:
   > Deitsch, S., Buerhop-Lutz, C., Sovetkin, E., Steland, A., Maier, A., Gallwitz, F., & Riess, C. (2021). "Segmentation of photovoltaic module cells in uncalibrated electroluminescence images." Machine Vision and Applications, 32(4), 1-23. Available at: https://github.com/zae-bayern/elpv-dataset

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
