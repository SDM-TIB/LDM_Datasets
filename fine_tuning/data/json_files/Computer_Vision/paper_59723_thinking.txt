To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Particle Mean Field Variational Bayes" by Minh-Ngoc Tran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methods and results, which may include references to datasets used for validation or testing.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their studies. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the context of the experiments conducted. For instance, the authors may describe how they applied their method to real-world datasets or simulated data. I will note any datasets that are explicitly named or described.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and credit to the original sources of the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the **HILDA Survey** dataset, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey. Australian Government Department of Social Services. Available at: [URL].

Similarly, if they mention the **Census dataset**, I will find its citation:
> U.S. Census Bureau. Available at: [URL].

Once I have gathered all the relevant datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and properly formatted before presenting it for review or further processing.
