To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Realistic Noise Synthesis with Diffusion Models" by Qi Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of obtaining sufficient training data for deep image denoising models and hints at the use of datasets for experiments. 

Next, I will look into the **experiments section**, specifically focusing on the **Datasets** subsection. Here, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **SIDD Small Dataset**: This dataset contains 160 image pairs of noisy and clean smartphone photos captured by 5 different cameras. It is used for both training the diffusion model and denoising experiments.

2. **SIDD Validation Dataset**: This dataset consists of 40 pairs of noisy and clean images from the same 5 smartphone cameras, used for validating noise generation and image denoising tasks.

3. **SIDD Medium Dataset**: This dataset contains 320 image pairs and is utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of the synthesized noise for the denoising task.

4. **LSDIR Dataset**: This dataset includes 84,991 high-quality training samples and is used to augment the data for training various denoising models.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **SIDD Small Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Abdelhamed, A.; Lin, S.; and Brown, M. S. 2018. A high-quality denoising dataset for smartphone cameras. In Proc. CVPR, 1692â€“1700.

- For the **SIDD Medium Dataset**, the citation is the same as the SIDD Small Dataset since it is part of the same work.

- For the **SIDD Validation Dataset**, it is also part of the SIDD dataset mentioned above.

- For the **LSDIR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li, Y.; Zhang, K.; Liang, J.; Cao, J.; Liu, C.; Gong, R.; Zhang, Y.; Tang, H.; Liu, Y.; Demandolx, D.; Ranjan, R.; Timofte, R.; and Van Gool, L. 2023. LSDIR Dataset: A Large Scale Dataset for Image Restoration.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help in organizing the datasets effectively for further processing or review.
