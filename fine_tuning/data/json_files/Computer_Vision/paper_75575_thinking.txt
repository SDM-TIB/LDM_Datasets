To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Guided Generation of Minority Samples Using Diffusion Models" by Soobin Um and Jong Chul Ye, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions experiments on "benchmark real datasets," which suggests that specific datasets are used, but does not name them. The introduction discusses the challenges of long-tailed distributions in datasets and the need for generating minority samples, indicating that datasets will likely be referenced later.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using four real-world benchmarks: **CelebA**, **LSUN-Bedrooms**, **ImageNet**, and a brain MRI dataset. I will note these datasets and their characteristics as described in the paper.

1. **CelebA Dataset**: This dataset is used for generating images with various attributes. It contains 202,599 celebrity images with 40 attribute labels. The authors mention that they constructed the pretrained model for CelebA by following specific settings.

2. **LSUN-Bedrooms Dataset**: This dataset consists of images of bedrooms and is used for unconditional image generation. The authors reference the dataset's construction and its use in their experiments.

3. **ImageNet Dataset**: This is a well-known dataset used for image classification, containing millions of images across thousands of categories. The authors mention using both ImageNet-64 and ImageNet-256 resolutions in their experiments.

4. **Brain MRI Dataset**: This in-house dataset contains 13,640 axial slice images of brain MRIs, specifically focusing on degenerative brain diseases. The authors state that this dataset is IRB-approved.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **CelebA Dataset**:
  > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

- **LSUN Dataset**:
  > Yu, F., Seff, A., Zhang, Y., Song, S., Funkhouser, T., & Xiao, J. (2015). *LSUN: Construction of a large-scale image dataset using deep learning with humans in the loop*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.03365.

- **ImageNet Dataset**:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- **Brain MRI Dataset**: Since this is an in-house dataset, it may not have a formal citation, but I will note that it is IRB-approved and contains 13,640 axial slice images.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details for future reference or processing.
