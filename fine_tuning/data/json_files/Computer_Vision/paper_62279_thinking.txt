To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BrainNet: Epileptic Wave Detection from SEEG with Hierarchical Graph Diffusion Learning" by Junru Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a "real-world SEEG dataset obtained from multiple patients," which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used in their experiments. Here, they describe the SEEG dataset collected from multiple epilepsy patients, including specifics about the number of hours recorded, the sampling frequency, and the number of electrodes and channels used. They also mention the total size of the dataset (769GB) and the imbalanced nature of the labels.

The dataset is characterized as follows:
- **SEEG Dataset**: This dataset consists of high-frequency and multi-channel SEEG signals obtained from multiple epilepsy patients, with an average recording of 53 hours per patient. The dataset includes 526 hours of SEEG signals in total.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is described as a collection from a first-class hospital and does not have a specific published citation, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset collected for the study.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and any relevant citation information. Since the dataset does not have a formal citation, I will indicate that it is a proprietary dataset.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for inclusion in the final output.
