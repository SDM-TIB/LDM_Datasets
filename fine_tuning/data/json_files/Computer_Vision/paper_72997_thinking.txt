To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Computer-aided diagnosis system for Alzheimer’s disease using principal component analysis and machine learning-based approaches" by Lilia Lazli, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses data from the **OASIS database** for Alzheimer’s disease detection and classification, which is a strong lead.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3), where the author provides a detailed description of the dataset. Here, it is mentioned that the OASIS database includes T1-weighted MRI and PET scans along with demographic and clinical assessment data for 300 subjects (210 AD patients and 90 healthy controls). This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides specific details about its composition.

I will also check the **acknowledgments section** for any additional context about the dataset. The paper mentions that the OASIS-3 data were provided by several principal investigators and lists relevant NIH grants, which adds credibility to the dataset's source.

Now, I will look up the full citation for the OASIS database in the **references section**. The relevant citation is:

- For the **OASIS database**:
  > Marcus, D.S., Wang, T.H., Parker, J., Csernansky, J.G., Morris, J.C., Buckner, R.L. "Open access series of imaging studies (OASIS): cross-sectional MRI data in young, middle aged, nondemented, and demented older adults." *Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience*, 19(9), 1498–1507, 2007.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset details and ensure that I have the full citation for the OASIS database, which is crucial for proper attribution.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the citation is included for reference.
