To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hyperspectral Image Super-resolution via Deep Progressive Zero-centric Residual Learning" by Zhiyu Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted over both real and synthetic benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors describe their evaluation on synthetic data. They specifically mention using two benchmark datasets: 

1. **CAVE Dataset**: This dataset contains 32 indoor hyperspectral images of spatial dimensions 512 × 512 and 31 spectral bands. The authors state that they randomly selected 20 images for training and the remaining 12 for testing.

2. **HARVARD Dataset**: This dataset consists of 50 indoor and outdoor hyperspectral images recorded under daylight illumination, with each image having 31 spectral bands of spatial dimensions 1024 × 1392. The authors used 30 images for training and 20 for testing.

In the **evaluation on real data** section, the authors mention two additional datasets:

3. **WorldView-2 (WV-2)**: This dataset contains an 8-band hyperspectral image of spatial dimensions 418 × 685, captured by a commercial satellite.

4. **National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM)**: This dataset includes a 48-band hyperspectral image of spatial dimensions 1202 × 4172, captured with a specific sensor.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **CAVE Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **WorldView-2 Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **NCALM Dataset**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
