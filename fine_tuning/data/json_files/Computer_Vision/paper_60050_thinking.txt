To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Goal-Conditioned Imitation Learning using Score-based Diffusion Policies" by Moritz Reuss et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of "large uncurated datasets" for training, which suggests that datasets are indeed involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly looking for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation. In the introduction, the authors mention "Learning from Play (LfP)" and refer to "unstructured play data," which indicates that they are using a specific type of dataset, but I need to find the exact datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their evaluation on several benchmarks. They mention using the **CALVIN Benchmark**, which consists of 6 hours of unstructured play data, and the **Block-Push Environment**, which includes 1000 demonstrations collected by a deterministic controller. Additionally, they refer to the **Relay Kitchen Environment**, which consists of 566 human-collected trajectories.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets:

1. **CALVIN Benchmark**: The citation is:
   > Oier Mees, Lukas Hermann, Erick Rosete-Beas, and Wolfram Burgard. *CALVIN: A benchmark for language-conditioned policy learning for long-horizon robot manipulation tasks*. IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 2022.

2. **Block-Push Environment**: The citation is:
   > Corey Lynch, Mohi Khansari, Ted Xiao, Vikash Kumar, Jonathan Tompson, Sergey Levine, and Pierre Sermanet. *Learning latent plans from play*. In Conference on Robot Learning, pages 1113â€“1132. PMLR, 2020.

3. **Relay Kitchen Environment**: The citation is:
   > Abhishek Gupta, Vikash Kumar, Corey Lynch, Sergey Levine, and Karol Hausman. *Relay policy learning: Solving long horizon tasks via imitation and reinforcement learning*. Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL), 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
