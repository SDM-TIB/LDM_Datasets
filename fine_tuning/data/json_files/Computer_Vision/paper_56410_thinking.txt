To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Object Representation Learning using Translation and Rotation Group Equivariant VAE" by Alireza Nasiri and Tristan Bepler, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and may reference datasets relevant to the study.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, particularly **section 4 (Results)**, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup and the datasets used. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions.

In the results section, the authors mention two specific datasets:

1. **MNIST(N)**: This dataset consists of MNIST digits that have been randomly rotated and translated. The authors specify that it contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of size 50x50 pixels.

2. **MNIST(U)**: Similar to MNIST(N), this dataset also consists of MNIST digits but with a different rotation sampling method. It also contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of the same dimensions.

Both datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper, and their details are explicitly provided.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset, and its citation is:

- For the MNIST dataset, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Since the authors generated variations of the MNIST dataset (MNIST(N) and MNIST(U)), I will note that these are derived from the original MNIST dataset and do not have separate citations.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the original MNIST dataset, which serves as the basis for the variations used in the experiments.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
