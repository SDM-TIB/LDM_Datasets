To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Federated Learning with Flexible Architectures" by Jong-Ik Park and Carlee Joe-Wong, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** (Section 5), where the authors describe their methodology and results. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and testing the models. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as well as any textual descriptions that provide context about the datasets.

In this paper, the authors mention using the following datasets for their experiments:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A widely used dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each, making it a more challenging dataset for classification tasks.

3. **Fashion MNIST**: A dataset consisting of 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items, divided into 10 categories, serving as a drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset.

4. **WikiText-2**: A dataset used for language modeling, containing over 2 million tokens extracted from Wikipedia articles.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- **Fashion MNIST**:
  > Zalando Research. *Fashion-MNIST: a Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. 2017.

- **WikiText-2**:
  > Stephen Merity, Nitish Srivastava, Geoffrey J. Gordon, and James A. Thorne. *Regularizing and Optimizing LSTM Language Models*. In Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
