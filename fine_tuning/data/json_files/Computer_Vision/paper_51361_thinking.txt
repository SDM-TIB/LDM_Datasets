To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatial Graph Convolutional Neural Network via Structured Subdomain Adaptation and Domain Adversarial Learning for Bearing Fault Diagnosis" by Mohammadreza Ghorvei et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used the **CWRU** and **Paderborn bearing datasets** to validate their method, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for understanding their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe the datasets in detail in **Section IV (Experiments)**. Here, they provide specific information about the datasets used:

1. **CWRU Bearing Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing vibration data collected under various operating conditions, including different loads and fault types. The authors mention that it includes normal and faulty conditions (Inner Race Fault, Outer Race Fault, Roller Fault) with varying fault diameters.

2. **Paderborn Bearing Dataset**: This dataset is also detailed in the experiments section, indicating that it includes data collected under different operational conditions, such as rotational speed and load torque, with similar fault types as the CWRU dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **CWRU Bearing Dataset**, the citation is:
  > K. Loparo, “Bearing vibration data set,” http://www.eecs.cwru.edu/laboratory/bearing/download.htm.

- For the **Paderborn Bearing Dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. Lessmeier, J. K. Kimotho, D. Zimmer, and W. Sextro, “Condition monitoring of bearing damage in electromechanical drive systems by using motor current signals of electric motors: A benchmark data set for data-driven classification,” in PHM Society European Conference, vol. 3, 2016.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will summarize the findings and prepare to format them according to the required structure, ensuring that the full citations are included for each dataset.
