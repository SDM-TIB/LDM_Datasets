To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Debatrix: Multi-dimensional Debate Judge with Iterative Chronological Analysis Based on LLM" by Jingcong Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions the introduction of the **PanelBench benchmark**, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (PanelBench)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two collections of debates:

1. **DebateArt**: This dataset is collected from an online debate platform that provides 1v1 debate arenas. The authors describe the voting system and the metrics used for evaluation, indicating that it includes various debates with dimensional judgments.

2. **BP-Competition**: This dataset consists of debates transcribed from world-class competitive debate competitions, including the World Universities Debating Championship (WUDC) and the European Universities Debating Championship (EUDC). The authors explain the structure of these debates and the criteria for inclusion in the dataset.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they utilized both the **DebateArt** and **BP-Competition** datasets to evaluate their proposed framework, Debatrix. This reinforces the importance of these datasets in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **DebateArt**, the citation is:
  > DebateArt. *DebateArt: An online debate platform*. Available at: https://debateart.org

- For **BP-Competition**, the citation is:
  > World Universities Debating Council. *World Universities Debating Championships Debating & Judging Manual*. Available at: https://wudc.info

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets and their relevant details from the paper.
