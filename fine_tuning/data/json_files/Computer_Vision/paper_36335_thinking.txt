To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Value Rule Sets" by Tong Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions experiments with "synthetic and real-world data," which suggests that there may be specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the author discusses experiments with both synthetic data and real-world datasets. Specifically, in **section 5 (Experimental Evaluation)**, the author lists four real-world datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Juvenile Dataset**: This dataset consists of 4,023 observations and 69 features, focusing on the consequences of juvenile exposure to violence.

2. **Credit Card Dataset**: This dataset contains 30,000 observations and 24 features, used to predict the default of credit card payments.

3. **Census Dataset**: This dataset has 48,842 observations and 14 features, aimed at predicting annual income based on demographic information.

4. **Recidivism Dataset**: This dataset includes 11,645 observations and 106 features, collected on offenders who committed felony crimes.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets used, which is common for publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note the context in which they are used and any relevant details provided in the paper.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

- **Juvenile Dataset**: 4,023 observations, 69 features. Focus on juvenile exposure to violence.
- **Credit Card Dataset**: 30,000 observations, 24 features. Predicts credit card payment defaults.
- **Census Dataset**: 48,842 observations, 14 features. Predicts annual income based on demographics.
- **Recidivism Dataset**: 11,645 observations, 106 features. Data on offenders and felony crimes.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for these datasets, I will note that they are commonly used datasets in the field of machine learning and can be found in various repositories or publications related to their respective domains.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
