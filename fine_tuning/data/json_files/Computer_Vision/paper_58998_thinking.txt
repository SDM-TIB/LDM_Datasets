To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GUESR: A Global Unsupervised Data-Enhancement with Bucket-Cluster Sampling for Sequential Recommendation" by Yongqiang Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges in sequential recommendation and may reference datasets used in prior work or their own experiments. I will look for specific mentions of datasets or references to publicly available datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly where the authors describe their experimental setup. In this section, they mention using four publicly available datasets: **ML-1M, Sports, Yelp, and Books**. I will take note of the details provided about each dataset, including the number of users, items, interactions, and sparsity.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

1. **ML-1M**: 
   > Harper, F. M., & Konstan, J. A. (2009). *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter, 5(1), 1-10.

2. **Sports**: 
   > This dataset is not explicitly cited in the paper, so I will need to search for a relevant source or dataset repository that provides this dataset.

3. **Yelp**: 
   > Yelp Inc. (2018). *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. Retrieved from https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge.

4. **Books**: 
   > This dataset is also not explicitly cited in the paper, so I will need to search for a relevant source or dataset repository that provides this dataset.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
