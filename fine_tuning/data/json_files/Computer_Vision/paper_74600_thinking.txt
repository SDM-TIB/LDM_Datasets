To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conditional score-based diffusion models for solving inverse elasticity problems" by Agnimitra Dasgupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets used for validation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly any subsections that discuss the experimental setup or data collection methods. This section often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics and how they were generated or collected.

In the **results section**, I will look for any references to datasets used for validation or comparison purposes. The authors may discuss how their method performed on specific datasets, which can provide insights into the datasets' names and their significance in the study.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to datasets. This is crucial as it often contains the full citations for datasets that are referenced in the paper. If the authors mention datasets that are derived from other studies, I will ensure to include those citations as well.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified in the paper:

1. **Synthetic Dataset for Quasi-static Elastography**: This dataset consists of 10,000 pairs of realizations of the shear modulus field and corresponding noisy displacement measurements. The dataset is generated using a finite element model and includes Gaussian noise.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided in the paper, but the methodology for generating this dataset is described in detail.

2. **Optic Nerve Head Dataset**: This dataset involves measurements of the shear modulus field surrounding the human optic nerve head, obtained from a finite element model. The dataset is used to validate the proposed method.
   - Citation: Ray et al. (2022). *The efficacy and generalizability of conditional GANs for posterior inference in physics-based inverse problems*. Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering.

3. **Dual-layer Phantom Dataset**: This dataset consists of 3,000 training data points generated from a dual-layer tissue-mimicking phantom. The dataset includes Young's modulus distributions and corresponding displacement measurements.
   - Citation: Lu et al. (2021). *Layer-specific ultrasound elastography using a multi-layered shear wave dispersion model for assessing the viscoelastic properties*. Physics in Medicine & Biology.

4. **Tumor Spheroid Dataset**: This dataset is derived from optical coherence elastography measurements of tumor spheroids. It includes Young's modulus fields and corresponding phase difference measurements.
   - Citation: Foo et al. (2024). *Tumor spheroid elasticity estimation using mechano-microscopy combined with a conditional generative adversarial network*. Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine.

After identifying these datasets, I will compile the full citations for each dataset, ensuring that they are accurately represented for future reference. This structured approach will help in systematically extracting and documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
