To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Analysis of Multi-Task Learning Efficiency: New Benchmarks on Light-Weighed Backbones and Effective Measurement of Multi-Task Learning Challenges by Feature Disentanglement" by Dayou Mao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions conducting large-scale experiments on the **MetaGraspNet dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely significant to the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using the **MetaGraspNet dataset**, **CityScapes**, and **NYU-v2** datasets for their experiments. I will gather details about each dataset, including their purpose and any relevant characteristics.

1. **MetaGraspNet Dataset**: This dataset is introduced as a new test ground for multi-task learning, emphasizing its larger size and increased task complexity. The authors reference it as a significant contribution to their research.

2. **CityScapes Dataset**: This dataset is well-known for semantic urban scene understanding and is commonly used in computer vision tasks. The authors mention it in the context of their experiments.

3. **NYU-v2 Dataset**: This dataset is also a standard benchmark in the field, particularly for indoor scene understanding tasks. The authors include it in their comparative analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MetaGraspNet**, the citation is:
  > Maximilian Gilles, Yuhao Chen, Emily Zhixuan Zeng, Yifan Wu, Kai Furmans, Alexander Wong, and Rania Rayyes. *Metagraspnetv2: All-in-one dataset enabling fast and reliable robotic bin picking via object relationship reasoning and dexterous grasping*. IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering, pages 1–19, 2023.

- For **CityScapes**, the citation is:
  > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 3213–3223, 2016.

- For **NYU-v2**, the citation is:
  > Nathan Silberman, Derek Hoiem, Pushmeet Kohli, and Rob Fergus. *Indoor segmentation and support inference from rgbd images*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2012: 12th European Conference on Computer Vision, Florence, Italy, October 7-13, 2012, Proceedings, Part V 12, pages 746–760. Springer, 2012.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its respective citation.
