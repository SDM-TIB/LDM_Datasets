To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Single Input Multi Output Model of Molecular Communication via Diffusion with Spheroidal Receivers" by Ibrahim Isik et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can give clues about the types of data used.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and results sections**. These sections often contain detailed descriptions of the experiments conducted, including any datasets used for simulations or analyses. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant parameters.

In this paper, the authors discuss the use of a **particle-based simulator (PBS)** to visualize diffusion in spheroidal systems. They also mention simulation parameters in **Table I**, which outlines various parameters used in their simulations, but it does not explicitly list datasets. However, the parameters may indicate the types of data that were generated or analyzed.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited or if there are foundational studies that provide datasets relevant to the research. This can include datasets used in previous studies that the authors build upon.

Upon reviewing the references, I find the following relevant citations that may correspond to datasets or foundational studies:

1. **H. Clevers, "Modeling development and disease with organoids," Cell, vol. 165, no. 7, pp. 1586â€“1597, 2016.**
   - This reference discusses organoids, which may relate to the types of spheroids used in the study.

2. **M. Rezaei et al., "Spheroidal molecular communication via diffusion: Signaling between homogeneous cell aggregates," arXiv preprint arXiv:2312.04427, 2023.**
   - This paper may provide insights or datasets related to molecular communication in spheroids.

3. **S. Bauer et al., "Functional coupling of human pancreatic islets and liver spheroids on-a-chip: Towards a novel human ex vivo type 2 diabetes model," Scientific reports, vol. 7, no. 1, p. 14620, 2017.**
   - This study may contain datasets related to spheroids and their applications in drug delivery or disease modeling.

After identifying these references, I will compile the full citations for each relevant dataset or foundational study that could be useful for understanding the context of the research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations, ready for further processing or review.
