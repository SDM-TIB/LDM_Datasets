To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Being Comes from Not-being: Open-vocabulary Text-to-Motion Generation with Wordless Training" by Junfan Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of text-to-motion generation and hints at the use of diverse labeled training data, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the need for large motion capture datasets and labeled motion description datasets. They specifically reference **AMASS** and **BABEL** datasets, which are crucial for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used. They state that all motion data and textual descriptions originated from **AMASS** and **BABEL**. The AMASS dataset is described as unifying various optical marker-based motion capture datasets with over 40 hours of motion data, while BABEL is a dataset of textual sentences for motions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **AMASS**:
   > Mahmood, N., Ghorbani, N., Troje, N. F., Pons-Moll, G., & Black, M. J. (2019). *AMASS: Archive of Motion Capture as Surface Shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

2. **BABEL**:
   > Punnakkal, A. R., Chandrasekaran, A., Athanasiou, N., Quiros-Ramirez, A., & Black, M. J. (2021). *BABEL: Bodies, Action and Behavior with English Labels*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately for future reference or processing.
