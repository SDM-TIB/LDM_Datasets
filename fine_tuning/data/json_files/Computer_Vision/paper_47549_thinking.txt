To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Improved Meta-learning Training for Speaker Verification" by Yafeng Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on the **Speaker in the Wild (SITW)** and **VOiCES** databases, which suggests that these are the primary datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Experimental settings)**, where the authors provide more detailed descriptions of the datasets. Here, they mention:

1. **Speaker in the Wild (SITW)**: This dataset is used for speaker recognition and includes two standard sets for testing: dev. core and eval. core. The authors note that they use both sets for their experiments.

2. **VOiCES**: This dataset is described as part of the "VOiCES from a Distance Challenge 2019." The authors provide details about the number of audio segments and speakers involved, as well as the structure of the evaluation set.

In addition to these datasets, the authors also mention using the development portions of **VoxCeleb1** and **VoxCeleb2** for training, which I will also include in my extraction.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Speaker in the Wild (SITW)**, the citation is:
  > M. McLaren, L. Ferrer, D. Castan, and A. Lawson. *The speakers in the wild (sitw) speaker recognition database*. In Interspeech, 2016, pp. 818â€“822.

- For **VOiCES**, the citation is:
  > M. K. Nandwana, J. Van Hout, M. McLaren, C. Richey, A. Lawson, and M. A. Barrios. *The voices from a distance challenge 2019 evaluation plan*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.10828, 2019.

- For **VoxCeleb1**, the citation is:
  > A. Nagrani, J. S. Chung, and A. Zisserman. *Voxceleb: A large-scale speaker identification dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1706.08612, 2017.

- For **VoxCeleb2**, the citation is:
  > J. S. Chung, A. Nagrani, and A. Zisserman. *Voxceleb2: Deep speaker recognition*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.05622, 2018.

With all this information gathered, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
