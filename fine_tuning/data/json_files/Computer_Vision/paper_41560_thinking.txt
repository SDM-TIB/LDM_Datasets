To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Multi-Label Classification with Label Graph Superimposing" by Ya Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on the **MS-COCO** and **Charades** datasets, indicating that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments** section. Here, the authors describe the datasets in more detail:

1. **MS-COCO**: This dataset is widely used for multi-label image recognition tasks and contains approximately 82,000 images for training, with 80 object labels. The average number of labels per image is 2.9.

2. **Charades**: This dataset consists of around 9,800 videos, with an average of 6.8 action labels per video. It includes 157 action labels and 66,500 annotated activities.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MS-COCO**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context. In *European Conference on Computer Vision*, 740–755.

- For **Charades**, the citation is:
  > Sigurdsson, G. A., Varol, G., Wang, X., Farhadi, A., Laptev, I., & Gupta, A. (2016). Hollywood in homes: Crowdsourcing data collection for activity understanding. In *European Conference on Computer Vision*.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **MS-COCO**: A dataset for multi-label image recognition with 82,000 images and 80 object labels.
   - Citation: Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context. In *European Conference on Computer Vision*, 740–755.

2. **Charades**: A dataset for multi-label video classification with 9,800 videos and 157 action labels.
   - Citation: Sigurdsson, G. A., Varol, G., Wang, X., Farhadi, A., Laptev, I., & Gupta, A. (2016). Hollywood in homes: Crowdsourcing data collection for activity understanding. In *European Conference on Computer Vision*.

With this information, I am ready to compile the dataset entries into the required format for further processing or review.
