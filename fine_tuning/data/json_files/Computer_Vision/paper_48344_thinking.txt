To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DAVOS: Semi-Supervised Video Object Segmentation via Adversarial Domain Adaptation" by Jinshuo Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the study. The abstract mentions that the authors achieve state-of-the-art performance on **DAVIS2016**, **FBMS59**, and **Youtube-Object** datasets, indicating that these are the primary datasets of interest.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find specific information about each dataset, including the number of sequences, annotations, and any relevant characteristics.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **DAVIS2016**: This dataset contains 50 video sequences with fine-grained object mask annotations for each frame, totaling 3,455 frames (2,079 for training and 1,376 for testing). The authors specify that they used the 480p version for their experiments.

2. **FBMS59**: This dataset consists of 59 video sequences, with 30 sequences designated for testing. The authors note that only a small subset of frames in each sequence is annotated, and they conducted unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) on its training split.

3. **Youtube-Object**: This dataset includes videos across 10 object categories, totaling 126 sequences, but it is not fully annotated. The evaluation is performed based on the ground truth provided by another source.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **DAVIS2016**, the citation is:
  > Federico Perazzi, Jordi Pont-Tuset, Brian McWilliams, Luc Van Gool, Markus Gross, and Alexander Sorkine-Hornung. *A benchmark dataset and evaluation methodology for video object segmentation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 724–732, 2016.

- For **FBMS59**, the citation is:
  > Peter Ochs, Jitendra Malik, and Thomas Brox. *Segmentation of moving objects by long term video analysis*. IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence, 36(6):1187–1200, 2013.

- For **Youtube-Object**, the citation is:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
