To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Customized Textual Image Generation using Diffusion Models" by Shubham Paliwal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a self-curated dataset for small-text generation and the CTW-1500 dataset for performance assessment. This indicates that there are at least two datasets to consider.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors discuss the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention:

1. **CTW-1500 Dataset**: This dataset is used for training the consistency decoder and evaluating the performance of the proposed method. The authors refer to it as a publicly available dataset.

2. **SmallFontSize Dataset**: This is a custom dataset created by the authors, containing 200 examples of textual prompts with corresponding character maps for generating small-sized texts.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **CTW-1500 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Liu Yuliang, Jin Lianwen, Zhang Shuaitao, and Zhang Sheng. *Detecting curve text in the wild: New dataset and new solution*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1712.02170, 2017.

- The **SmallFontSize Dataset** is a self-created dataset by the authors, so it does not have a formal citation in the references. However, I will note that it is described in the paper as containing 200 examples of textual prompts.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **CTW-1500 Dataset**: A publicly available dataset used for training and evaluation, focusing on curve text detection.
2. **SmallFontSize Dataset**: A custom dataset created by the authors for generating small-sized text images.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the CTW-1500 dataset and note the self-created nature of the SmallFontSize dataset. This structured approach will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
