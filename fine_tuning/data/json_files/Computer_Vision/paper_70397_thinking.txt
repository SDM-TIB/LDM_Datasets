To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FontCLIP: A Semantic Typography Visual-Language Model for Multilingual Font Applications" by Yuki Tatsukawa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors discuss a font attribute dataset that is crucial for their model's training, which indicates that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Finetuning - Training Data)**, where the authors explicitly mention using a dataset from O’Donovan et al. (2014). They describe this dataset as consisting of 200 Roman fonts, each annotated with 37 attribute scores. This section provides essential details about the dataset's content and its relevance to their research.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The citation for the dataset is as follows:
- O’Donovan, P., Lunundefinedbeks, J., Agarwala, A., & Hertzmann, A. (2014). Exploratory font selection using crowdsourced attributes. *ACM Transactions on Graphics*, 33(4), 1-10. doi:10.1145/2601097.2601110.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets referenced in the paper. However, the primary dataset used for training the FontCLIP model is the one from O’Donovan et al. (2014), which is clearly articulated in the methodology.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset utilized in the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
