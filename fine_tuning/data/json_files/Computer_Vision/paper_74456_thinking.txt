To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Video Frame Interpolation for Polarization via Swin-Transformer" by Feng Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a dataset called **PVFI-Mono** for evaluating their proposed method. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe the **PVFI-Mono dataset** in detail in section 3.4.1. Here, they explain how the dataset was collected, the camera specifications, and the types of scenes included (rotation and translation). This section provides essential details about the dataset's characteristics.

Additionally, I will check for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. In section 4.1.2, the authors mention training their model on the **PHSPD dataset**, which is used for 3D human shape reconstruction from polarization images. This dataset is also relevant and needs to be included.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **PVFI-Mono Dataset**: The paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset since it is newly introduced. However, I will note that it is a dataset created by the authors for their research.

2. **PHSPD Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Zou, S., Zuo, X., Qian, Y., et al. (2020). *Polarization Human Shape and Pose Dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.14899.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset, including its purpose, characteristics, and any relevant details provided in the paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or analysis.
