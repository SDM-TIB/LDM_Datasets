To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge Transfer for Few-shot Segmentation of Novel White Matter Tracts" by Qi Lu and Chuyang Ye, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method on a publicly available dMRI dataset, which indicates that a dataset is involved. The introduction further elaborates on the need for accurate segmentation of novel WM tracts and hints at the use of existing datasets for training.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **results** sections. In this paper, the authors specifically mention using the **Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset** for their evaluations. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its purpose and any specific characteristics mentioned.

In the **results section**, the authors describe the experimental settings and confirm that the HCP dataset was used for evaluation, which reinforces its significance in their study.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the HCP dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Glasser, M.F., Sotiropoulos, S.N., Wilson, J.A., Coalson, T.S., Fischl, B., Andersson, J.L., Xu, J., Jbabdi, S., Webster, M., Polimeni, J.R., Van Essen, D.C., Jenkinson, M. (2013). The minimal preprocessing pipelines for the Human Connectome Project. *NeuroImage*, 80, 105â€“124.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the HCP dataset, I will create an entry for this dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured.
