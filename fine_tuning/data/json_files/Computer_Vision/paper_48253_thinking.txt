To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Editing Conditional Radiance Fields" by Steven Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention demonstrating their approach on "three shape datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will navigate to the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention the datasets they utilized for their experiments:

1. **PhotoShape Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as containing chairs with large appearance variation. They specify that they used 100 instances with 40 training views per instance.

2. **Aubry Chairs Dataset**: This dataset is noted for having a large shape variation, consisting of 500 instances with 36 training views per instance.

3. **GRAF CARLA Dataset**: The authors mention this dataset as having a single view per instance, with 1,000 instances included.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **PhotoShape Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Keunhong Park, Konstantinos Rematas, Ali Farhadi, and Steven M. Seitz. *Photoshape: Photorealistic materials for large-scale shape collections*. ACM Transactions on Graphics, 37(6), Nov. 2018.

- For the **Aubry Chairs Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mathieu Aubry, Daniel Maturana, Alexei A Efros, Bryan C Russell, and Josef Sivic. *Seeing 3D chairs: exemplar part-based 2D-3D alignment using a large dataset of CAD models*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3762–3769, 2014.

- For the **GRAF CARLA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Conference on Robot Learning, pages 1–16, PMLR, 2017.

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining the integrity of the research and providing proper credit to the original sources.
