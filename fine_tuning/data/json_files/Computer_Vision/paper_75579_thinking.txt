To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Repurformer: Transformers for Repurposing-Aware Molecule Generation" by Changhun Lee and Gyumin Lee, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on the **BindingDB dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their data collection process from **BindingDB**, stating that it contains over 2.8 million measured binding affinities of interactions between proteins and drug-like molecules. They also mention that they filtered this dataset to create a final dataset of **60,719 protein-compound pairs** derived from **3,006 proteins and 7,803 compounds**.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **BindingDB dataset**. The citation provided in the references is:

- For **BindingDB**, the citation is:
  > Michael K. Gilson, Tiqing Liu, Michael Baitaluk, George Nicola, Linda Hwang, and Jenny Chong. *BindingDB in 2015: A public database for medicinal chemistry, computational chemistry and systems pharmacology*. Nucleic Acids Research, 44(D1):D1045â€“D1053, 2016.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **BindingDB Dataset**: This dataset contains over 2.8 million measured binding affinities of interactions between proteins and drug-like molecules. After preprocessing, it consists of **60,719 protein-compound pairs** derived from **3,006 proteins and 7,803 compounds**.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant details and citations for the dataset mentioned in the paper.
