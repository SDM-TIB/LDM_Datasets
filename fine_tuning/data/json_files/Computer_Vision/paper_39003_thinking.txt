To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Geometry of Deep Generative Models for Disentangled Representations" by Ankita Shukla et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their models on two datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup and Results)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples of handwritten digits, distributed across 10 classes. The specified component is the class identity, while unspecified factors include digit slant and stroke width.

2. **MultiPIE Dataset**: The authors use a subset of this dataset, which includes 25 identities for training and 5 identities for testing, with each identity having 3,300 images. The specified factors are identity, while unspecified factors include pose and expression.

3. **3D Chairs Dataset**: This dataset consists of images of different chair models, showcasing various styles and large viewpoint variations. The authors selected a subset of 30 models from this dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the datasets, I will compile the following citations:

- **MNIST Dataset**: 
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

- **MultiPIE Dataset**: 
  > R. Gross, I. Matthews, and S. Baker. *Multi-PIE: Multiple Pose, Illumination, and Expression in Faces*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition, 2008.

- **3D Chairs Dataset**: 
  > Scott Reed, Kihyuk Sohn, Yuting Zhang, and Honglak Lee. *Learning to Disentangle Factors of Variation with Manifold Interaction*. In International Conference on Machine Learning, 2014.

Now, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
