To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Unified Analysis of Mixed Sample Data Augmentation: A Loss Function Perspective" by Chanwoo Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors discuss their empirical study on **CIFAR-100** and **ImageNet** classification tasks, indicating that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** section. I will focus on any subsections that detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on **CIFAR-100** and **ImageNet-1K**, confirming their use as datasets.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The relevant citations are:

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **CIFAR-100**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 100 classes, with 600 images per class.
2. **ImageNet-1K**: A dataset containing over 1.2 million images across 1,000 classes, widely used for image classification tasks.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets with their full citations, as this is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

With this structured approach, I will compile the dataset entries for downstream processing or review.
