To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3D VR Sketch Guided 3D Shape Prototyping and Exploration" by Ling Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a method for 3D shape modeling using VR sketches, which suggests that a dataset of sketches is likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of working with freehand VR sketches and mention the existence of a fine-grained dataset of VR sketches created by participants without art experience. This is a strong indication that a specific dataset is being utilized.

In the **experiments section**, particularly section 4.2, the authors explicitly state that they use the only available fine-grained dataset of freehand VR sketches by Luo et al. [36]. They describe this dataset as consisting of 1,005 sketch-shape pairs for the chair category of ShapeNet, with a training set of 803 pairs and a test set of 202 pairs. This section provides clear details about the dataset's composition and its intended use.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The citation for the dataset is as follows:

- For the **VR Sketch Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ling Luo, Yulia Gryaditskaya, Yongxin Yang, Tao Xiang, and Yi-Zhe Song. *Fine-grained VR sketching: Dataset and insights*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV), 2021.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **VR Sketch Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,005 sketch-shape pairs specifically for the chair category from ShapeNet. It is designed for training and testing models that generate 3D shapes from VR sketches.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
