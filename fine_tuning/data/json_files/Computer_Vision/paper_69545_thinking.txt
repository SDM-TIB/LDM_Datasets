To extract datasets from the research paper titled "From Data to Decisions: The Transformational Power of Machine Learning in Business Recommendations" by Kapilya Gangadharan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the research focus, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the study.

Next, I will examine the **related works section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of previous studies. This section often contains citations that may lead to datasets used in similar research.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. If the authors describe their methodology for data sourcing, I will pay close attention to any datasets they mention, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research. I will ensure that I capture the complete citation format, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

If the paper mentions any specific datasets without providing full citations, I will note these and look for additional sources or papers that might provide the necessary citation details.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in this research paper.
