To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FATNET: HIGH RESOLUTION KERNELS FOR CLASSIFICATION USING FULLY CONVOLUTIONAL OPTICAL NEURAL NETWORKS" by Riad Ibadulla et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors trained their network with the **CIFAR-100 dataset**, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials section**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the **CIFAR-100 dataset**. They state that it consists of 60,000 images of 32x32 resolution, split into 20 superclasses with 100 classes, and that 50,000 images are used for training while 10,000 are for testing. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides essential details.

I will also check the **Data Availability Statement** at the end of the paper, which includes a link to the CIFAR-100 dataset. This is crucial for providing the full citation.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the CIFAR-100 dataset from the references section. The citation is as follows:
> Krizhevsky, A. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Tech. Rep. [Online]. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/learning-features-2009-TR.pdf

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the only dataset extracted is the CIFAR-100 dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry with the necessary details, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper referencing.
