To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-supervised source localization in reverberant environments with deep generative modeling" by Michael J. Bianco et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions a new acoustic dataset obtained at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and references the use of the LibriSpeech corpus. This indicates that there are at least two datasets to look for.

Next, I will look into the **experiments** section, specifically where the authors discuss the datasets used for training and validation. In this section, they describe the DTU dataset, which consists of reverberant acoustic impulse responses recorded in a classroom, and the LibriSpeech corpus, which is used for generating reverberant speech.

I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **DTU Acoustic Dataset**: This dataset includes reverberant acoustic impulse responses recorded in a classroom environment from various source locations. The authors mention that it was recorded in June 2020 and provides detailed information about the room dimensions and microphone setup.

2. **LibriSpeech Corpus**: This is a well-known dataset containing recorded speech from public domain audiobooks. The authors specify that it contains 5.4 hours of speech data, which is used to generate reverberant speech by convolving with the impulse responses from the DTU dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **DTU Acoustic Dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but the authors describe it in detail in the paper. Therefore, I will note it as:
  > Bianco, M. J., Gannot, S., & Gerstoft, P. (2020). *Semi-supervised source localization with deep generative modeling*. Technical University of Denmark (DTU) dataset.

- For the **LibriSpeech Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Panayotov, V., Chen, G., Povey, D., & Khudanpur, S. (2015). *Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 5206â€“5210.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
