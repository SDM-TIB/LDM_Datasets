To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning 3D Dense Correspondence via Canonical Point Autoencoder" by An-Chieh Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on tasks such as **3D semantic keypoint transfer and part segmentation transfer**, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors describe their experimental setup. In **Section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, they mention using the **KeypointNet dataset** for the semantic keypoint transfer task. This dataset is described as containing diverse objects with large-scale annotations, which is crucial for their evaluation.

Additionally, they reference the **ShapeNet part dataset** in **Section 4.1** for the part segmentation label transfer task. This dataset is noted for its comprehensive part annotations, which are essential for the experiments conducted.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **KeypointNet dataset**, the citation is:
   > Yang You, Yujing Lou, Chengkun Li, Zhoujun Cheng, Liangwei Li, Lizhuang Ma, Cewu Lu, and Weiming Wang. *Keypointnet: A large-scale 3d keypoint dataset aggregated from numerous human annotations*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 13647–13656, 2020.

2. For the **ShapeNet part dataset**, the citation is:
   > Li Yi, Vladimir G Kim, Duygu Ceylan, I-Chao Shen, Mengyan Yan, Hao Su, Cewu Lu, Qixing Huang, Alla Sheffer, and Leonidas Guibas. *A scalable active framework for region annotation in 3d shape collections*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 35(6):1–12, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
