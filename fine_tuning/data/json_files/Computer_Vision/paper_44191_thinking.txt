To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding Object Detection Through An Adversarial Lens" by Ka-Ho Chow et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention using two benchmark datasets: **PASCAL VOC** and **MS COCO**. I will note down these names and any relevant details provided about them.

In the **experimental analysis** section, the authors describe their experiments conducted on these datasets, confirming their use. They provide performance metrics and comparisons based on these datasets, which further validates their significance in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **PASCAL VOC**, the citation is:
  > Everingham, M., Eslami, S.A., Van Gool, L., Williams, C.K., Winn, J., Zisserman, A. (2015). *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge: A Retrospective*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 111(1), 98–136.

- For **MS COCO**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., Zitnick, C.L. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

Having gathered the dataset names and their citations, I will now compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper while providing the necessary citations for further reference.
