To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating Synthetic Net Load Data with Physics-informed Diffusion Model" by Shaorong Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical studies sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilized real-world smart meter data from **Pecan Street**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of data scarcity and privacy concerns in obtaining net load data. They mention the importance of generating synthetic net load data and refer to the **Pecan Street dataset** as a source for validation.

In the **numerical studies section**, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets used in their experiments. The authors state that they used net load data for residential customers in Austin, Texas, collected by **Pecan Street Inc.** This dataset includes daily energy consumption, solar PV production, and net-load time series of individual customers, specifically mentioning data from **25 residential households** from January 1, 2018, to December 30, 2018.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the **Pecan Street dataset** from the references section. The citation is as follows:
> Pecan Street Inc., “Pecan street dataport,” 2020. [Online]. Available: https://dataport.pecanstreet.org/

Since this is the primary dataset referenced throughout the paper, I will ensure to include it in my final output.

After confirming the details, I will compile the dataset entry for the **Pecan Street dataset** and ensure that it includes the necessary information such as the dataset name, description, and full citation.

In summary, the key steps I will take are:
1. Read through the abstract, introduction, and numerical studies sections to identify datasets.
2. Confirm the dataset's relevance and details in the numerical studies section.
3. Retrieve the full citation for the **Pecan Street dataset** from the references.
4. Compile the dataset entry with all necessary information.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
