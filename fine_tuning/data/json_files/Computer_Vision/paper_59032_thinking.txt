To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Zero-Shot Text-to-Parameter Translation for Game Character Auto-Creation" by Rui Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a novel method for character auto-creation but does not explicitly mention datasets. I will need to dig deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **related work section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of previous studies. This section often provides insights into the datasets used by other researchers, which may be relevant to the current study.

I will then focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset like the **3D Face Morphable Model**, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Volker Blanz and Thomas Vetter. *A morphable model for the synthesis of 3D faces*. In Proceedings of the 26th annual conference on Computer graphics and interactive techniques, pages 187â€“194, 1999.

I will repeat this process for each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring I capture the full citation for each one.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including names, descriptions, and citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This will ensure that all relevant datasets are documented accurately and comprehensively.
