To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FastLGS: Speeding up Language Embedded Gaussians with Feature Grid Mapping" by Yuzhou Ji et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets along with their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In the introduction, the authors often discuss the context of their work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any mention of datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention several datasets in the experiments section, which is crucial for my extraction process.

The paper lists the following datasets:

1. **SPIn-NeRF Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of evaluating the performance of the proposed method. It is important to note the specific contributions of this dataset to the experiments.

2. **LERF Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as a challenging dataset that requires zero-shot abilities, and it is used for localization accuracy in the experiments.

3. **3D-OVS Dataset**: This dataset is also referenced for comparison with other methods, highlighting its relevance in the context of the research.

4. **MIP-360 Dataset**: This dataset is used for downstream applications, indicating its importance in the broader context of the research.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to gather the full citations for each of these datasets. This is a critical step, as providing accurate citations is essential for proper attribution.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
