To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks for Seven Basic Facial Expression Classifications" by Yuan Tai, Yihua Tan, Wei Gong, and Hailan Huang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved accuracy on the **FER2013 test set**, which suggests that this dataset is relevant to their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the classification of seven basic facial expressions, but they do not introduce any new datasets here. However, they reference the **FER2013 dataset** as a benchmark for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on the **FER2013 dataset**. They mention the performance of their model on both the **PublicTestSet** and **PrivateTestSet** of FER2013, which confirms that these subsets are part of the dataset they utilized.

Now, I will check the **References section** for the full citation of the FER2013 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **FER2013 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Goodfellow I J, Erhan D, Carrier P L, et al. Challenges in representation learning: A report on three machine learning contests. In International Conference on Neural Information Processing. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2013: 117-124.

Since the authors do not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

I will create an entry for the FER2013 dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. After this, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
