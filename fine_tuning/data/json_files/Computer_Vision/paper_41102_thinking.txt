To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How Does Language Influence Documentation Workflow? Unsupervised Word Discovery Using Translations in Multiple Languages" by Marcely Zanon Boito et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a **bilingual Mboshi-French parallel corpus** and its translation into four other languages, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, in the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of language documentation and reference the **Mboshi-French parallel corpus** (Godard et al., 2017) as a key dataset. This suggests that this corpus is central to their research.

In the **methodology section**, the authors provide more details about the **Multilingual Mboshi Parallel Corpus**, which is an extension of the original Mboshi-French corpus. They mention that this corpus contains **5,130 utterances** with audio, transcriptions, and translations in French, and that translations into English, German, Portuguese, and Spanish were added. This section confirms the existence of a dataset that has been expanded for their experiments.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if the authors refer to any specific datasets used for their experiments. They mention using the **Mboshi-French parallel corpus** and its multilingual extension, which reinforces the importance of this dataset in their work.

Finally, I will consult the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **Mboshi-French parallel corpus**, the citation is:
   > Godard, P., Adda, G., Adda-Decker, M., Benjumea, J., Besacier, L., Cooper-Leavitt, J., Kouarata, G.-N., Lamel, L., Maynard, H., MÃ¼ller, M., et al. (2017). *A very low resource language speech corpus for computational language documentation experiments*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.03501.

2. The authors also reference their own work for the bilingual unsupervised word segmentation approach:
   > Godard, P., Zanon Boito, M., Ondel, L., Berard, A., Yvon, F., Villavicencio, A., and Besacier, L. (2018). *Unsupervised word segmentation from speech with attention*. In Interspeech.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately represented for further processing or review.
