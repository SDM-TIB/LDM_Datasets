To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervisedly Training GANs for Segmenting Digital Pathology with Automatically Generated Annotations" by Michael Gadermayr et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for segmentation applications in digital pathology, which suggests that datasets are involved, particularly for training and evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors highlight the challenges of acquiring large amounts of annotated training data in digital pathology. They mention the need for datasets that cover variability in staining protocols and pathological modifications, indicating that they likely used specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the part where they describe the experimental setup. The authors mention using **whole slide images (WSIs)** for their experiments, specifically stating that they extracted patches from these images. They note that they used 18 WSIs, which were manually annotated under the supervision of a medical expert. This indicates that the dataset consists of these WSIs, but I need to find the exact references for these images.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their method and compare it with a supervised approach, which implies that they have a dataset for evaluation. They mention the number of annotated glomeruli and the training WSIs, which provides context for the dataset used.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not explicitly name a specific dataset but refers to the WSIs used for training and evaluation. Therefore, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset:

- For the **whole slide images (WSIs)** used in the study, the citation is:
  > Michael Gadermayr, Laxmi Gupta, Barbara M. Klinkhammer, Peter Boor, and Dorit Merhof. *Unsupervisedly Training GANs for Segmenting Digital Pathology with Automatically Generated Annotations*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), 2023.

Since the authors did not reference any external datasets, I will summarize the dataset information based on the details provided in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that all information is accurately represented for further processing or review.
