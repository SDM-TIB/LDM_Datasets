To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Mutual Excitation for Hand-to-Hand and Human-to-Human Interaction Recognition" by Mengyuan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **Assemble101 Dataset**: This dataset is described as a large-scale multi-view video dataset for understanding procedural activities, containing 46,286 action segments for training and 21,900 for testing. It includes 90 objects and 24 interaction verbs, leading to a total of 1,380 fine-grained actions.

2. **NTU60-Interaction Dataset**: This dataset originates from the NTU-RGB+D dataset and contains 56,578 samples covering 60 action labels. The authors specify that they used 11 human interaction classes for their experiments.

3. **NTU120-Interaction Dataset**: Built upon the original NTU-RGB+D-120 dataset, this dataset includes 113,945 samples covering 120 action labels. The authors utilized 26 human interaction classes for their analysis.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Assemble101 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > F. Sener, D. Chatterjee, D. Shelepov, K. He, D. Singhania, R. Wang, and A. Yao. "Assembly101: A large-scale multi-view video dataset for understanding procedural activities." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 21 096–21 106, 2022.

- For **NTU60-Interaction Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Shahroudy, J. Liu, T.-T. Ng, and G. Wang. "NTU RGB+D: A large scale dataset for 3D human activity analysis." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1010–1019, 2016.

- For **NTU120-Interaction Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Liu, A. Shahroudy, M. Perez, G. Wang, L.-Y. Duan, and A. C. Kot. "NTU RGB+D 120: A large-scale benchmark for 3D human activity understanding." IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 42, no. 10, pp. 2684–2701, 2019.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
