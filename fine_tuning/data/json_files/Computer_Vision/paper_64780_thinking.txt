To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CoinRun: Solving Goal Misgeneralisation" by Stuart Armstrong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the CoinRun challenge, which suggests that it may be a dataset or a benchmark used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the CoinRun misgeneralisation problem. They describe CoinRun as a reinforcement learning problem created to evaluate the generalization performance of trained agents. This indicates that CoinRun is indeed a dataset or benchmark used in their experiments.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in section 3.2, the authors provide a detailed description of the CoinRun environment, including its structure and the training process for agents. They mention that the agents were trained on 100,000 procedurally generated levels, which reinforces that CoinRun is a dataset used for testing their approach.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CoinRun dataset. The authors cite a paper by Cobbe et al. (2019) that quantifies generalization in reinforcement learning, which is likely the original source for the CoinRun dataset.

The citation for the CoinRun dataset is:
> Cobbe, K., Klimov, O., Hesse, C., Kim, T., Schulman, J. (2019). *Quantifying generalization in reinforcement learning*. In: International Conference on Machine Learning. pp. 1282â€“1289. PMLR.

Since CoinRun is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for CoinRun, ensuring that it is clear and complete for any further processing or review.
