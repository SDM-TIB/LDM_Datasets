To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bayesian Methods for Media Mix Modelling with Shape and Funnel Effects" by Javier Marín, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of Bayesian models in Marketing Mix Modelling (MMM), but it does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where datasets are typically described. In this paper, the author mentions using two datasets for validation:

1. **Dataset 1**: This dataset contains 2.5 years of weekly data from an online store that spends on both online and offline media channels. It includes various columns such as media spend and a KPI (Key Performance Indicator) column representing sales.

2. **Dataset 2**: This dataset represents a business with physical stores, where advertising is done through one online media channel and five offline channels. It also includes weekly sales as the KPI.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or models referenced in the paper. However, since the datasets are described as synthetic and specific to the experiments conducted by the author, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets.

For **Dataset 1**, I will summarize it as follows:
- **Name**: Synthetic Dataset 1
- **Description**: Contains 2.5 years of weekly data with media spend across multiple channels and a KPI column for sales.
- **Citation**: Marín, J. (2023). Bayesian Methods for Media Mix Modelling with Shape and Funnel Effects. 

For **Dataset 2**, I will summarize it similarly:
- **Name**: Synthetic Dataset 2
- **Description**: Represents a business with physical stores, utilizing one online and five offline media channels, with weekly sales as the KPI.
- **Citation**: Marín, J. (2023). Bayesian Methods for Media Mix Modelling with Shape and Funnel Effects.

Now, I will compile these dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations as required.
