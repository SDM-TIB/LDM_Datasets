To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Concise Fuzzy System Modeling Integrating Soft Subspace Clustering and Sparse Learning" by Peng Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on various real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section V), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for performance comparison. In this section, they state that they adopted **ten real-world medical datasets from the UCI Repository** for their experiments. This is a clear indication that I need to extract the names and details of these datasets.

I will then look for a **table (Table II)** that summarizes the datasets, which includes the name of each dataset, the number of samples, features, classes, and additional details. The datasets listed are:

1. **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original)**
2. **Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC)**
3. **Wisconsin Prognostic Breast Cancer (WPBC)**
4. **Heart Disease**
5. **Statlog (Heart)**
6. **SPECT Heart**
7. **SPECTF Heart**
8. **Hepatitis**
9. **Kidney Disease**
10. **Thyroid**

Each dataset has specific attributes such as the number of samples, features, and classes, which I will also note down.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide individual citations for each dataset, but I can refer to the UCI Machine Learning Repository for the standard citations associated with these datasets. Here are the general citations for the datasets:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
