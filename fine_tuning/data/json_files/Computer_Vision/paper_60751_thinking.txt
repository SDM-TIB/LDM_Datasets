To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Open Information Extraction via Chunks" by Kuicai Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method, Chunk-OIE, achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple OIE datasets. This indicates that there are datasets used for evaluation, which I need to identify.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** section, particularly in **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, I will pay close attention to any dataset names, descriptions, and their respective citations.

In **section 5.2 (OIE Dataset)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **LSOIE Dataset**: This dataset is derived from QA-SRL 2.0 and is mentioned as being large-scale, with two domains: Wikipedia and Science. It provides n-ary OIE tuples.

2. **CaRB Dataset**: This is described as the largest crowdsourced OIE dataset, containing 1,282 sentences with binary tuples.

3. **BenchIE Dataset**: This dataset supports evaluations for multiple languages and provides binary OIE annotations.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **LSOIE Dataset**:

- For **CaRB Dataset**:
  > Sangnie Bhardwaj, Samarth Aggarwal, and Mausam. *CaRB: A crowdsourced benchmark for open IE*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), pages 6262–6267, Hong Kong, China, 2019.

- For **BenchIE Dataset**:
  > Kiril Gashteovski, Mingying Yu, Bhushan Kotnis, Carolin Lawrence, Mathias Niepert, and Goran Glavaš. *BenchIE: A framework for multi-faceted fact-based open information extraction evaluation*. In Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 4472–4490, Dublin, Ireland, 2022.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
