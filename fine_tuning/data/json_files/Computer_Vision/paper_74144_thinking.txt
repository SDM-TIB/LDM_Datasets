To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Efficient Differentially Private Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Models" by Jing Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method using the **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10** datasets, which suggests these are key datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to gather more details about how these datasets are used. In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention using **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10** as private datasets, and they also reference **SVHN** and **ImageNet32** as public datasets. This confirms that I need to include all four datasets in my extraction.

Now, I will summarize the datasets:

1. **MNIST**: This dataset consists of 60,000 training samples of handwritten digits, which is commonly used for image classification tasks.
2. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset contains 50,000 training samples across 10 classes of images, widely used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.
3. **SVHN**: The Street View House Numbers dataset contains images of house numbers from Google Street View, and it has the same classes as MNIST.
4. **ImageNet32**: A subset of the larger ImageNet dataset, which contains 1,281,167 training samples across 1,000 classes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:

- For **ImageNet32**, the citation is:

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
