To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convolutional Phase Retrieval via Gradient Descent" by Qing Qu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, including any datasets used.

2. **Identify Sections on Datasets**: Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets. In many research papers, there is a dedicated section titled "Datasets" or "Experiments" where the authors describe the datasets used in their study. I will pay close attention to these sections to find detailed descriptions.

3. **Extract Dataset Information**: For each dataset mentioned, I will extract the following information:
   - **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
   - **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose, size, and any relevant characteristics.
   - **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset, which is crucial for proper attribution.

4. **Consult the References Section**: After identifying the datasets, I will check the references section of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important as datasets often have associated papers that describe their creation and usage.

5. **Document the Findings**: I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its name, description, and citation.

6. **Review for Completeness**: Finally, I will review the entire paper to ensure that I have not missed any datasets and that all relevant information has been accurately captured.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I extract and document the datasets from the paper thoroughly and accurately.
