To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FUSECAP: Leveraging Large Language Models for Enriched Fused Image Captions" by Noam Rotstein et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the creation of a training set of **12M image-enriched caption pairs**, which indicates that a dataset has been generated. I will note this down as it is a significant dataset.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** and **experiments** sections. In the introduction, the authors reference several datasets used for training and evaluation, including **COCO**, **CC**, **CC12**, and **SBU**. I will make a note of these datasets as they are crucial for understanding the context of the research.

In the **methodology** section, the authors describe how they leverage existing datasets to create their enriched dataset. They specifically mention using **COCO** for human-annotated data and **CC**, **CC12**, and **SBU** as large-scale datasets collected from the web. This confirms that these datasets are integral to their approach.

I will also check the **experiments** section to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if there are specific details about how these datasets were utilized. The authors confirm that the enriched dataset consists of **12 million image-caption pairs** derived from the aforementioned datasets.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

With these citations collected, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:
