To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic Product Search" by Priyanka Nigam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for the experiments. In this case, the authors mention using customer behavior data, which suggests that there may be datasets related to customer queries and product interactions.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their training data in **Section 4 (Data)**, where they mention using 11 months of search logs as training data and 1 month as evaluation data. They also specify that they sampled 54 billion query-product pairs, which is a significant dataset for their experiments.

I will note the details provided about the dataset, including the size and nature of the data. The authors explain that they preprocess the sampled pairs to create a more manageable dataset of 650 million rows, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's scope.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this paper, the authors primarily discuss their own data collection and preprocessing methods rather than citing external datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the details they provide about their dataset.

The dataset extracted from the paper can be summarized as follows:

1. **Customer Behavior Data**: This dataset consists of 11 months of search logs used for training and 1 month for evaluation. It includes 54 billion query-product pairs, which are preprocessed into 650 million rows for the experiments.

Since the authors do not provide a formal citation for this dataset, I will note that it is derived from their internal data collection process at Amazon.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly state the dataset's name, description, and any relevant details, even if a formal citation is not available. This will help in documenting the dataset for future reference or analysis.
