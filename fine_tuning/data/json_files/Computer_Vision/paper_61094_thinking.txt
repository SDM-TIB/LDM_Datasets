To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reconstruction Error-based Anomaly Detection with Few Outlying Examples" by Fabrizio Angiulli, Fabio Fassetti, and Luca Ferragina, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on anomaly detection using Autoencoders, but it does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will look for more detailed information in the introduction and experimental sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various anomaly detection techniques but do not mention specific datasets. I will proceed to the **experimental results section** where the authors describe their experiments in detail.

In **section 4.1 (Experimental settings)**, the authors mention that they used several datasets for their experiments, specifically referring to the **ODDS library** and popular image datasets like **MNIST**, **E-MNIST**, **Fashion-MNIST**, and **CIFAR-10**. This is a crucial finding as it indicates the datasets used for their anomaly detection experiments.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the following:

1. **MNIST Dataset**:
   > Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. 2010. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

2. **E-MNIST Dataset**:
   > Cohen, G., Afshar, S., Tapson, J., & Schaik, A. *EMNIST: an extension of MNIST to handwritten letters*. 2017. Available at: http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05373

3. **Fashion-MNIST Dataset**:
   > Xiao, H., Rasul, K., & Vollgraf, R. *Fashion-MNIST: a Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. 2017.

4. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
   > Krizhevsky, A., Nair, V., & Hinton, G. *CIFAR-10*. Available at: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/kriz/cifar.html

Additionally, the authors mention using datasets from the **ODDS library**. I will look up the citation for this library as well:

5. **ODDS Library**:
   > Rayana, S. *ODDS Library*. Available at: http://odds.cs.stonybrook.edu (2017).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be described with its name and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for proper referencing.
