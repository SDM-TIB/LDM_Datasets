To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exogenous Data in Forecasting: FARM - A New Measure for Relevance Evaluation" by Ramón Christen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract discusses the relevance of exogenous data series in improving forecast capabilities, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the importance of exogenous variables in forecasting but again does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will look into the **experiments** section, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. In this paper, the authors mention that they validate their FARM approach using synthetic signals. This indicates that the datasets used for validation are not real-world datasets but rather artificially generated data for testing purposes.

Since the paper does not reference any specific datasets from external sources, I will note that the primary dataset used is synthetic. However, I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are indirectly referenced through the studies cited in the paper. The authors mention several studies that utilize exogenous data for forecasting, such as those by Hernández et al. (2012), De Felice et al. (2013), and others. I will extract the full citations for these studies, as they may provide context or datasets relevant to the research.

Here are the full citations for the studies mentioned in the paper that may relate to datasets:

1. Hernández et al. (2012):
   > Luis Hernández, Carlos Baladrón, Javier M. Aguiar, Lorena Calavia, Belén Carro, Antonio Sánchez-Esguevillas, Diane J. Cook, David Chinarro, and Jorge Gómez. *A Study of the Relationship between Weather Variables and Electric Power Demand in Sensors, inside a Smart Grid/Smart World Framework*. Sensors, 12(9):11571–11591, September 2012.

2. De Felice et al. (2013):
   > Matteo De Felice, Andrea Alessandri, and Paolo M. Ruti. *Electricity demand forecasting over Italy: Potential benefits using numerical weather prediction models*. Electric Power Systems Research, 104:71–79, November 2013.

   > Akin Tascikaraoglu and Borhan M. Sanandaji. *Short-term residential electric load forecasting: A comprehensive spatio-temporal approach*. Energy and Buildings, 111:380–392, January 2016.

   > Guangya Zhu, Tin-Tai Chow, and Norman Tse. *Short-term load forecasting coupled with weather information*. Building Services Engineering Research and Technology, 39(3):310–327, May 2018.

Now that I have identified the relevant studies and their citations, I will summarize the findings regarding datasets. The primary dataset used in the paper is synthetic, and the authors reference several studies that may contain datasets related to exogenous variables in forecasting.

In conclusion, I will compile the information regarding the datasets and their citations, ensuring that I have accurately represented the sources and their relevance to the research conducted in this paper.
