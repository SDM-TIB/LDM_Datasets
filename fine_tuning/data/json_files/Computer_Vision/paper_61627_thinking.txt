To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Controllable Motion Diffusion Model" by Yi Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention any datasets used for training or evaluation. In the introduction, I will look for phrases that indicate the use of specific datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. I will look for any sections explicitly labeled as "Datasets" or similar, where the authors might describe the datasets in detail, including their characteristics, sizes, and purposes.

As I read through these sections, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of data). If the authors reference any existing datasets, I will ensure to capture the full citation for those datasets as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the "LaFAN1 dataset" for training, I will look for the corresponding citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> FÃ©lix G. Harvey, Mike Yurick, Derek Nowrouzezahrai, and Christopher Pal. *Robust Motion In-Betweening*. 39, 4 (2020).

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a clear format for further processing or review, ensuring that all citations are correctly formatted and complete.
