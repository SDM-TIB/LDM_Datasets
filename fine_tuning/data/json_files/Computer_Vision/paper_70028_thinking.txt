To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Material Microstructure Design Using VAE-Regression with Multimodal Prior" by Avadhut Sardeshmukh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used for training or validation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of modeling structure-property linkages in materials science, which may lead to mentions of specific datasets used in their experiments. I will pay close attention to any references to datasets or prior works that may have provided datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and experimental results sections**. In these sections, the authors typically describe the datasets in detail, including how they were generated or sourced. For example, the authors mention using a dataset presented in Fernandez-Zelaia et al. [5] for their experiments. I will extract the details of this dataset, including its characteristics and how it was utilized in the study.

The paper describes a dataset of 3-D microstructures and their associated elastic stiffness properties. The authors explain that this dataset was synthetically generated and includes a variety of morphological features. I will note the specifics of this dataset, such as the number of microstructures and the methods used to generate them.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset mentioned. For the dataset referenced from Fernandez-Zelaia et al., I will ensure to extract the complete citation as follows:

- For the dataset of 3-D microstructures and elasticity properties:
  > Fernandez-Zelaia, P., Yabansu, Y.C., Kalidindi, S.R. "A comparative study of the efficacy of local/global and parametric/nonparametric machine learning methods for establishing structureâ€“property linkages in high-contrast 3D elastic composites." *Integrating Materials and Manufacturing Innovation*, 8(2), 2019.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, including the dataset name, description, and full citation, into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details from the paper regarding the datasets used in the research.
