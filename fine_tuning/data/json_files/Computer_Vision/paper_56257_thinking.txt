To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training with Knowledge Graphs" by Xuran Pan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their model on three knowledge graph datasets, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for understanding their work.

Next, I will focus on the **data preparation section (Section 4.1)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for training. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **VisualSem**: A high-quality multi-modal knowledge graph dataset that includes entities with multilingual glosses, multiple illustrative images, and visually relevant relations. It covers a total of 90k nodes, 1.3M glosses, and 938k images.

2. **Visual Genome**: A knowledge-based scene graph dataset that connects structured image concepts with semantic relations. It serves as a benchmark for various vision tasks.

3. **ConceptNet**: A language-based knowledge graph that connects words and phrases with labeled edges, built from various sources including expert-created resources and crowd-sourcing.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used in their training process, reinforcing their importance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **VisualSem**, the citation is:
  > Houda Alberts, Teresa Huang, Yash Deshpande, Yibo Liu, Kyunghyun Cho, Clara Vania, and Iacer Calixto. *Visualsem: a high-quality knowledge graph for vision and language*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2008.09150, 2020.

- For **Visual Genome**, the citation is:
  > Ranjay Krishna, Yuke Zhu, Oliver Groth, Justin Johnson, Kenji Hata, Joshua Kravitz, Stephanie Chen, Yannis Kalantidis, Li-Jia Li, David A Shamma, et al. *Visual genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations*. International journal of computer vision, 123(1):32â€“73, 2017.

- For **ConceptNet**, the citation is:
  > Robyn Speer, Joshua Chin, and Catherine Havasi. *Conceptnet 5.5: An open multilingual graph of general knowledge*. In Thirty-first AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, 2017.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I maintain the integrity of the information as presented in the paper. This will allow for accurate referencing and further exploration of the datasets used in the research.
