To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "CVGG-Net: Ship Recognition for SAR Images Based on Complex-Valued Convolutional Neural Network" by Dandan Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the proposed method is validated on several SAR datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors discuss the datasets used for validation. In this section, they mention two datasets:

1. **CSRSDD (Complex SAR images Rotation Ship Detection dataset)**: This dataset is annotated in reference [24]. It consists of complex SAR images collected in GF-3 Spotlight mode with a resolution of 1m. The dataset includes various ship categories and is formatted according to the DOTA dataset format.

2. **OpenSARship**: This is a public dataset released by Shanghai JiaoTong University in 2017, referenced as [25]. It contains ground range multi-look products and slant range single-look complex products with both VV and VH polarization. The dataset includes three types of ship targets: Bulk carrier, Cargo, and Tanker.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For **CSRSDD**, the citation is:
  > Lei, S., Qiu, X., Ding, C., & Lei, S. (2021). A Feature Enhancement Method Based on the Sub-Aperture Decomposition for Rotating Frame Ship Detection in SAR Images. In *2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS*, Brussels, Belgium, pp. 3573-3576. doi: 10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553635.

- For **OpenSARship**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation, which is crucial for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent work.
