To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepSphere: A Graph-Based Spherical CNN" by Michaël Defferrard et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate DeepSphere on relevant problems, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), as this is typically where datasets are explicitly listed and described. In this section, the authors discuss various tasks and the datasets used for each task. 

1. **SHREC’17 Dataset**: This dataset is used for 3D object recognition and contains 51,300 randomly oriented 3D models from ShapeNet. The authors mention that the objects are represented by spherical maps. I will note down the details and the citation for this dataset.

   Citation:

2. **Cosmological Model Dataset**: The authors mention using a dataset of 720 partial convergence maps from two ΛCDM cosmological models for cosmological model classification. I will extract the relevant details and citation.

   Citation:

3. **Climate Event Segmentation Dataset**: The paper discusses a dataset produced by a 20-year run of the Community Atmospheric Model (CAM5), which consists of 16 channels of climate data. The authors reference a pre-processed dataset from Jiang et al. (2019). I will note this dataset and its citation.

   Citation:
   > Jiang, C., Huang, J., Kashinath, K., Prabhat, Marcus, P., & Niessner, M. (2019). *Spherical CNNs on unstructured grids*. In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

4. **Weather Station Dataset**: The authors mention collecting historical measurements from approximately 10,000 weather stations scattered across the Earth for their experiments on uneven sampling. I will document this dataset and its citation.

   Citation:

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the correct and complete citations for each one. I will compile the dataset entries, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
