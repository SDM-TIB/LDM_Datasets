To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fusing multimodal neuroimaging data with a variational autoencoder" by Eloy Geenjaar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study evaluates representations learned using a schizophrenia classification task, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **method section**, particularly the **C. Data** subsection, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their study. Here, they mention three datasets: **FBIRN**, **B-SNIP**, and **COBRE**. The authors describe how these datasets were processed using NeuroMark to obtain independent component networks (ICNs) and structural MRI scans, indicating that these datasets are crucial for their analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

1. **FBIRN**: 
   > Calhoun, V. D., Adali, T., Pearlson, G. D., & Kiehl, K. A. (2006). Neuronal chronometry of target detection: fusion of hemodynamic and event-related potential data. *Neuroimage*, 30(2), 544-553.

2. **B-SNIP**: 
   > Abrol, A., Fu, Z., Salman, M., Silva, R., Du, Y., Plis, S., & Calhoun, V. (2021). Deep learning encodes robust discriminative neuroimaging representations to outperform standard machine learning. *Nature communications*, 12(1), 1-17.

3. **COBRE**: 
   > Du, Y., Fu, Z., Sui, J., Gao, S., Xing, Y., Lin, D., ... & Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. (2019). NeuroMark: an adaptive independent component analysis framework for estimating reproducible and comparable fMRI biomarkers among brain disorders. *MedRxiv*, 19008631.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, ready for further processing or review.
