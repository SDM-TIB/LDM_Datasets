To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FPConv: Learning Local Flattening for Point Convolution" by Yiqun Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of 3D point cloud analysis and mention the use of datasets for evaluating their proposed method. However, I need to look for specific dataset names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Stanford Large-Scale 3D Indoor Space (S3DIS)**: This dataset contains 3D point clouds of 272 rooms, annotated with semantic labels across 13 categories. The authors describe how they prepared the training data by sampling points from blocks of the dataset.

2. **ScanNet**: This dataset consists of 1513 3D indoor scene scans, with a split of 1201 for training and 312 for testing. The authors provide details on how the data is sampled and represented.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. Here are the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For **S3DIS**, the citation is:
  > Iro Armeni, Ozan Sener, Amir R. Zamir, Helen Jiang, Ioannis Brilakis, Martin Fischer, and Silvio Savarese. *3D Semantic Parsing of Large-Scale Indoor Spaces*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016.

- For **ScanNet**, the citation is:
  > Angela Dai, Angel X Chang, Manolis Savva, Maciej Halber, Thomas Funkhouser, and Matthias Nießner. *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D Reconstructions of Indoor Scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 5828–5839, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation for future reference or processing.
