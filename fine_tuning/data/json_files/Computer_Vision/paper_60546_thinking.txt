To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MF-NeRF: Memory Efficient NeRF with Mixed-Feature Hash Table" by Yongjae Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the advancements in neural radiance fields (NeRF) and the challenges associated with memory usage and training time. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets at this point.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. They mention two specific datasets:

1. **Synthetic NeRF Dataset**: This dataset includes eight different synthetic scenes, each containing 400 posed images. The images are divided into training (100), validation (100), and testing (200) sets, all with a resolution of 800×800.

2. **Mip-NeRF360 Dataset**: This dataset consists of seven unbounded real scenes, with each scene containing between 125 and 311 images. The authors specify that they select every 8th image for testing, and the image resolutions vary by scene.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Synthetic NeRF Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Mip-NeRF360 Dataset**, the citation is:

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
