To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Edit Friendly DDPM Noise Space: Inversion and Manipulations" by Inbar Huberman-Spiegelglas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation or experimentation. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Modified ImageNet-R-TI2I**: This dataset is derived from the original ImageNet dataset and includes additional examples collected from the internet and other datasets. It comprises 48 images, each with 3-5 different target prompts, resulting in a total of 212 image-text pairs.

2. **Modified Zero-Shot I2IT**: This dataset contains images of four classes (Cat, Dog, Horse, Zebra) and includes 15 images in total, with one target prompt for each category, making 60 image-text pairs.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the original sources for the datasets used:

- For the **Modified ImageNet-R-TI2I** dataset, the citation is:
  > Narek Tumanyan, Michal Geyer, Shai Bagon, and Tali Dekel. *Plug-and-play diffusion features for text-driven image-to-image translation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.12572, 2022.

- For the **Modified Zero-Shot I2IT** dataset, the citation is:
  > Gaurav Parmar, Krishna Kumar Singh, Richard Zhang, Yijun Li, Jingwan Lu, and Jun-Yan Zhu. *Zero-shot image-to-image translation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.03027, 2023.

Having gathered this information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will allow for a structured representation of the datasets used in the research paper.
