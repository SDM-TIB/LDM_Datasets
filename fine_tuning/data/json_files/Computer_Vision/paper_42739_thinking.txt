To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "Giving Commands to a Self-driving Car" by Thierry Deruyttere et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on challenging datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two datasets:

1. **Talk2Car Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing images from the nuScenes dataset, annotated with natural language commands for self-driving cars. It consists of 11,959 commands across 9,217 images, with details about the complexity of the commands and the distribution of training, validation, and test sets.

2. **RefCOCO Dataset**: This dataset is based on the MS-COCO dataset and includes 142,209 referring expressions for 50,000 objects. The authors provide information about the average length of expressions and the split of the dataset into training, validation, and testing subsets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Talk2Car Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Deruyttere, T., Vandenhende, S., Grujicic, D., Van Gool, L., & Moens, M.F. (2019). Talk2Car: Taking control of your self-driving car. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), pp. 2088–2098.

- For the **RefCOCO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yu, L., Poirson, P., Yang, S., Berg, A.C., & Berg, T.L. (2016). Modeling context in referring expressions. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 69–85.

Now that I have the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details for future reference or processing.
