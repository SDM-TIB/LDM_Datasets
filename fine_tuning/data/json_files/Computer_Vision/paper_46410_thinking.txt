To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantum Optical Convolutional Neural Network: A Novel Image Recognition Framework for Quantum Computing" by Rishab Parthasarathy and Rohan Bhowmik, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors benchmark their new architecture against the **MNIST dataset**, which is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition.

Next, I will look into **section II (Methods)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset used. They mention that the **MNIST dataset** consists of 70,000 images, with 60,000 allocated for training and 10,000 for testing. This section confirms that the MNIST dataset is the primary dataset utilized in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The authors reference multiple sources related to the MNIST dataset, including:

- **The MNIST Database**: 
  > LeCun, Yann; Cortes, Corinna; and Burges, Christopher J.C. "THE MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits." NYU. Yann LeCun. Raw data. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. Retrieved on 6 Dec. 2020.

This citation provides the necessary details about the dataset's origin and access.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the MNIST dataset for its experiments, I will compile the information regarding this dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry based on the information gathered, ready for any structured output or further processing.
