To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Including Images into Message Veracity Assessment in Social Media" by Abderrazek Azri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for assessing the veracity of social media messages, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (The Proposed Framework)**, where the authors describe their methods. Here, they mention the need for datasets to test their framework. Specifically, they refer to the **MediaEval Verifying Multimedia Use benchmark** as a dataset they plan to use. This is a crucial dataset for my extraction.

In the **conclusion section**, the authors express their intention to build a new dataset for their task, but they do not provide specific details about this dataset. Therefore, I will focus on the MediaEval dataset for which I need to find the full citation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to locate the full citation for the MediaEval dataset. The relevant reference is:

- For the **MediaEval Verifying Multimedia Use benchmark**, the citation is:
  > C. Boididou, K. Andreadou, S. Papadopoulos, D.-T. Dang-Nguyen, G. Boato, M. Riegler, Y. Kompatsiaris, et al. *Verifying multimedia use at MediaEval 2015*. In MediaEval, 2015.

Since the authors mention their intention to create a new dataset but do not provide a citation for it, I will note that this dataset is not yet available for citation.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MediaEval dataset while noting the absence of a citation for the new dataset they plan to create.
