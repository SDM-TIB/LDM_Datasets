To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parallel Diffusion Models of Operator and Image for Blind Inverse Problems" by Hyungjin Chung et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed method on two representative tasks: blind deblurring and imaging through turbulence, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In section 4.1, the authors mention conducting experiments on the **FFHQ** (Flickr-Faces-HQ) dataset and the **AFHQ-dog** dataset for blind deblurring tasks. They specify the dimensions of the images used (256x256) and the number of validation and test sets, which provides useful context for each dataset.

For imaging through turbulence, the authors mention using the **ImageNet** dataset, also with dimensions of 256x256. This indicates that the ImageNet dataset is utilized for a different experimental setup.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **FFHQ Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. *A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 4401–4410, 2019.

2. **AFHQ Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yunjey Choi, Youngjung Uh, Jaejun Yoo, and Jung-Woo Ha. *Stargan v2: Diverse image synthesis for multiple domains*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 8188–8197, 2020.

3. **ImageNet Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research.
