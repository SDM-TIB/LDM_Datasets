To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Performance Analysis of DNN Inference/Training with Convolution and non-Convolution Operations" by Hadi Esmaeilzadeh et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in previous works, which could lead me to the datasets used in this study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or evaluation sections**. If the authors have conducted experiments, they are likely to describe the datasets used for training and testing their models. I will pay attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets.

If the paper includes a **results section**, I will check for any references to datasets used in the experiments, including their characteristics, such as size, type, and any specific attributes relevant to the study.

Once I identify the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, I would look for the citation in the references, which might be something like:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: A Benchmark in Machine Learning*. 2009.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the representation of each dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation.
