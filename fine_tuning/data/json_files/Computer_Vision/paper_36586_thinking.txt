To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Reconfigurable Streaming Deep Convolutional Neural Network Accelerator for Internet of Things" by Li Du et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a CNN accelerator but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** to see if the authors describe any datasets used for testing or validation. In the **experiments section**, they mention using a modified LeNet-5 model for traffic sign detection, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to traffic signs.

I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **results section** or any tables that might summarize the datasets used. The paper references a "traffic-sign net" and discusses its architecture, but it does not provide a specific dataset name or details.

Since the paper does not explicitly list any datasets, I will check the **References section** for any citations that might refer to datasets used in their experiments. The references include various works related to deep learning and CNNs, but I need to identify if any of these references correspond to datasets.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the paper cites works that may have used datasets, but it does not provide a direct citation for a specific dataset used in their experiments. The closest reference is to a paper on traffic sign recognition, which might imply the use of a traffic sign dataset, but it does not provide a full citation for it.

Since the paper lacks explicit dataset citations, I will summarize my findings as follows:

1. **Traffic Sign Dataset**: While the paper discusses using a modified LeNet-5 for traffic sign detection, it does not provide a specific dataset name or citation. The authors may have used a commonly known dataset in the field, but this is not explicitly stated.

In conclusion, I will note that the paper does not provide clear dataset citations, which is essential for proper referencing. If I were to create a structured output, I would indicate that no specific datasets were cited in the paper, and I would recommend looking for commonly used datasets in traffic sign recognition literature for further reference.
