To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fully Convolutional Networks for Panoptic Segmentation with Point-based Supervision" by Yanwei Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method is evaluated on several datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names in the following sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors explicitly mention four datasets:

1. **COCO (Common Objects in Context)**: This dataset is widely used for various computer vision tasks, including segmentation. It contains 80 thing classes and 53 stuff classes, with a total of 118K training images.

2. **VOC 2012 (PASCAL Visual Object Classes)**: This dataset includes 20 object categories and is commonly used for semantic segmentation tasks. The authors mention that they augmented the original training set with additional annotations from the SBD dataset.

3. **Cityscapes**: This dataset consists of street-view images with fine annotations, specifically designed for urban scene understanding. It includes 5,000 finely annotated images.

4. **Mapillary Vistas**: A large-scale dataset that includes a variety of scenes with 37 thing classes and 28 stuff classes, containing images of varying resolutions.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **COCO**, the citation is:
  > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. DollÃ¡r, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, 2014.

- For **VOC 2012**, the citation is:
  > M. Everingham, S. A. Eslami, L. Van Gool, C. K. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge: A Retrospective*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 2015.

- For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:
  > M. Cordts, M. Omran, S. Ramos, T. Rehfeld, M. Enzweiler, R. Benenson, U. Franke, S. Roth, and B. Schiele. *The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016.

- For **Mapillary Vistas**, the citation is:
  > G. Neuhold, T. Ollmann, S. Rota Bulo, and P. Kontschieder. *The Mapillary Vistas Dataset for Semantic Understanding of Street Scenes*. In IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
