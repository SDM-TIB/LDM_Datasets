To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Context-Guided Diffusion for Out-of-Distribution Molecular and Protein Design" by Leo Klarner et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of generative models for molecular therapeutics and materials, which suggests that datasets related to molecular structures or properties might be involved. The introduction further elaborates on the challenges of molecular discovery and hints at the datasets used for training and evaluation.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 5 (Empirical Evaluation)** and any dedicated **dataset sections**. In these sections, the authors often describe the datasets used for their experiments, including their characteristics and how they were utilized.

Upon reviewing the paper, I identify the following datasets:

1. **ZINC Database**: The authors mention using a subset of 250,000 molecules from the ZINC database for their experiments. This dataset is crucial for evaluating the performance of their proposed method in molecular design.

   Full citation:

2. **cc-PBH Dataset**: The paper discusses a dataset of 34,071 cata-condensed polybenzenoid hydrocarbons (cc-PBHs) with up to 11 benzene rings, which is used for materials design experiments.

   Full citation:

3. **Antibody Sequence Dataset**: The authors utilize a dataset consisting of approximately 100,000 paired heavy and light chain sequences from the OAS and SABDAB databases for protein design tasks.

   Full citation:
   > Olsen, T. H., Boyles, F., & Deane, C. M. (2022). Observed antibody space: A diverse database of cleaned, annotated, and translated unpaired and paired antibody sequences. *Protein Science*, 31(1), 141-146.

4. **SABDAB Database**: This database is referenced for the antibody sequences used in the study.

   Full citation:
   > Dunbar, J., Krawczyk, K., Leem, J., Baker, T., Fuchs, A., Georges, G., Shi, J., & Deane, C. M. (2014). SABDAB: the structural antibody database. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 42(D1), D1140-D1146.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have captured their descriptions accurately and that the citations are complete. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for easy reference and use in future analyses or applications.
