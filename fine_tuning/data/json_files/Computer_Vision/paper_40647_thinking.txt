To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mocycle-GAN: Unpaired Video-to-Video Translation" by Yang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Datasets and Experimental Settings)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will look for explicit mentions of dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their contents or characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Viper Dataset**: This dataset is described as a popular visual perception benchmark that includes videos from a realistic virtual world (GTA gameplay) under various ambient conditions. It consists of annotated frames with pixel-level labels. The authors specify that they split 77 videos into training and testing sets.

2. **Flower Video Dataset**: This dataset contains time-lapse videos depicting the blooming or fading of various flowers, without any synchronization. The resolution of each video is noted, which is important for understanding the dataset's characteristics.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Viper Dataset**, the citation is:
> Stephan R Richter, Zeeshan Hayder, and Vladlen Koltun. *Playing for benchmarks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2017.

For the **Flower Video Dataset**, the citation is:
> Aayush Bansal, Shugao Ma, Deva Ramanan, and Yaser Sheikh. *Recycle-GAN: Unsupervised video retargeting*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2018.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
