To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalized Multi-kernel Maximum Correntropy Kalman Filter for Disturbance Estimation" by Shilei Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for simulations or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any datasets that are critical to their work. This section often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include datasets that are foundational to the study.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used in the experiments. The authors may describe the datasets in detail, including their characteristics, size, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

The **experiments section** is crucial as it typically details the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets or provide performance metrics based on them.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its full citation in the references. If they refer to a dataset that is not widely known, I will ensure to capture the citation provided by the authors.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
