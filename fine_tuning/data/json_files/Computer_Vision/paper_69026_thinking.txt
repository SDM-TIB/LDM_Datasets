To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MV2MAE: Multi-View Video Masked Autoencoders" by Ketul Shah et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors report state-of-the-art results on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **NTU RGB+D 60**: This dataset consists of 56,880 videos from 60 distinct action classes, recorded from 40 subjects using Kinect-v2. The authors note that the dataset includes two benchmarks: Cross-Subject (xsub) and Cross-View (xview).

2. **NTU RGB+D 120**: An extension of the NTU-60 dataset, this dataset contains 114,480 videos spanning 120 action categories. The evaluation protocols follow the established Cross-Subject (xsub) and Cross-Setup (xset) benchmarks.

3. **ETRI**: This dataset consists of 112,620 videos captured from 55 action classes, focusing on activities of daily living for elderly care. The authors mention that they use a cross-subject benchmark for evaluation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **NTU RGB+D 60**, the citation is:
  > Amir Shahroudy, Jun Liu, Tian-Tsong Ng, and Gang Wang. *NTU RGB+D: A large scale dataset for 3D human activity analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 1010–1019, 2016.

- For **NTU RGB+D 120**, the citation is:
  > Jun Liu, Amir Shahroudy, Mauricio Perez, Gang Wang, Ling-Yu Duan, and Alex C Kot. *NTU RGB+D 120: A large-scale benchmark for 3D human activity understanding*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 42(10):2684–2701, 2020.

- For **ETRI**, the citation is:
  > Jinhyeok Jang, Dohyung Kim, Cheonshu Park, Minsu Jang, Jaeyeon Lee, and Jaehong Kim. *ETRI-activity3D: A large-scale RGB-D dataset for robots to recognize daily activities of the elderly*. In 2020 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), pages 10990–10997. IEEE, 2020.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
