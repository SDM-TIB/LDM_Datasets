To extract datasets from the research paper titled "X-ray Multi-modal Intrinsic-Speckle-Tracking" by Konstantin M. Pavlov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets or experimental data. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may highlight key datasets used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **methods and experiments sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including how they were collected and any specific characteristics of the data. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup and the data collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), which is a crucial dataset for their analysis.

I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, such as specific types of data collected (e.g., images, measurements) and the conditions under which they were gathered. For instance, the paper discusses the use of X-ray speckle tracking data collected from a red currant sample, which is a specific dataset that needs to be noted.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the same datasets if needed. I will ensure to note down the complete citation format as used in the paper.

For example, if the paper references a dataset from a previous study, I will extract the citation as follows:
- For the dataset used in the experiments, I will note:
  > Konstantin M. Pavlov, David M. Paganin, Heyang (Thomas) Li, et al. *X-ray Multi-modal Intrinsic-Speckle-Tracking*. [Journal Name], [Volume], [Page Numbers], [Year].

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately and comprehensively.
