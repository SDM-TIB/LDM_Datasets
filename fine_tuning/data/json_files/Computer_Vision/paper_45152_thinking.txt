To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BAAAN: Backdoor Attacks Against Autoencoder and GAN-Based Machine Learning Models" by Ahmed Salem et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the application of autoencoders and GANs, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using three benchmark vision datasets: **MNIST**, **CIFAR-10**, and **CelebA**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their purpose and any specific configurations mentioned.

In the **evaluation settings subsection**, the authors specify that they use the default image sizes for MNIST and CIFAR-10, and they scale CelebA images to 128x128. This information is crucial for understanding how the datasets were utilized in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. Available at: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3730â€“3738, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
