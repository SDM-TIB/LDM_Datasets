To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decoupled Diffusion Models: Simultaneous Image to Zero and Zero to Noise" by Yuhang Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method on datasets such as **CIFAR-10** and **CelebA-HQ-256**. This indicates that these datasets are likely important for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section V) to gather more details about the datasets used. Here, the authors explicitly mention that they perform experiments on both unconditioned and conditioned image generation tasks using the **CIFAR-10** dataset and the **CelebA-HQ-256** dataset. They also refer to other datasets for specific tasks, such as **DIV2K** for super-resolution, **DUTS** for saliency detection, and **BSDS** for edge detection.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. **CIFAR-10**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

2. **CelebA-HQ-256**: The citation is:
   > Tero Karras, Timo Aila, Samuli Laine, and Jaakko Lehtinen. *Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability, and Variation*. In ICLR, 2018.

3. **DIV2K**: The citation is:
   > E. Agustsson and R. Timofte. *NTIRE 2017 Challenge on Single Image Super-Resolution: Dataset and Study*. In CVPRW, 2017.

4. **DUTS**: The citation is:
   > L. Wang, H. Lu, Y. Wang, M. Feng, D. Wang, B. Yin, and X. Ruan. *Learning to Detect Salient Objects with Image-Level Supervision*. In CVPR, 2017.

5. **BSDS**: The citation is:
   > P. Arbelaez, M. Maire, C. Fowlkes, and J. Malik. *Contour Detection and Hierarchical Image Segmentation*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 33, no. 5, pp. 898â€“916, 2010.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are correctly formatted for future reference.
