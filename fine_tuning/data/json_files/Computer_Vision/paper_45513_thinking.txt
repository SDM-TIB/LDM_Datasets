To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning interaction kernels in mean-field equations of 1st-order systems of interacting particles" by Quanjun Lang and Fei Lu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical examples sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the data consists of discrete space-time observations of the solution, which indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **numerical examples section (Section 4)**. This section typically provides details about the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will pay attention to any descriptions of the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and how they were generated.

In **Section 4.1 (Numerical settings)**, the authors describe the settings for data generation. They mention using a semi-implicit Structure Preserving scheme for generating data from the mean-field equation. They also specify the parameters used for the data generation, such as time intervals and mesh sizes. However, they do not explicitly name a dataset but rather describe the process of generating the data.

In **Section 4.2 (Cubic potential)**, the authors discuss the estimation results and provide relative errors for the estimators. They mention that the data consists of observations from the "true" solution, but again, they do not provide a specific dataset name.

In **Section 4.3 (Opinion dynamics)**, the authors describe the opinion dynamics model and the interaction function used. They mention that the initial value is a mixture of densities, but there is still no specific dataset name provided.

In **Section 4.4 (Repulsion-attraction potential)**, the authors describe the estimation results for a repulsion-attraction potential, but again, they do not specify a dataset name.

Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset names or citations, I will note that the data used in the experiments is generated from the authors' own simulations based on the described models and methods. Therefore, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Generated Data for Cubic Potential**: Data generated using the semi-implicit Structure Preserving scheme for nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations, with specific parameters for time and space mesh sizes.

2. **Generated Data for Opinion Dynamics**: Data generated from the opinion dynamics model, with initial conditions based on a mixture of densities.

3. **Generated Data for Repulsion-Attraction Potential**: Data generated from the repulsion-attraction potential model, with specific viscosity constants and initial conditions.

Since there are no formal citations for these datasets, I will note that they are derived from the authors' simulations and methodologies described in the paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for review or further processing, ensuring to highlight the lack of formal dataset citations while summarizing the nature of the generated data.
