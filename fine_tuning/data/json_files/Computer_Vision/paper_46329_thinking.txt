To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Energy-Based Models by Diffusion Recovery Likelihood" by Ruiqi Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate the efficacy of their method on various image datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset is described as containing 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, with a resolution of 32 × 32 pixels.

2. **CelebA**: This dataset consists of 202,599 face images, with 162,770 used for training and 19,962 for testing. The images are processed to a resolution of 64 × 64 pixels.

3. **LSUN**: The authors mention using two categories from the LSUN dataset: church outdoor and bedroom. The church outdoor category contains 126,227 training images, while the bedroom category has 3,033,042 training images. Both categories have 300 test images, and the images are resized to either 64 × 64 or 128 × 128 pixels.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Large-scale celebfaces attributes (celeba) dataset*. Retrieved August, 15:2018, 2018.

- For **LSUN**, the citation is:
  > Fisher Yu, Ari Seff, Yinda Zhang, Shuran Song, Thomas Funkhouser, and Jianxiong Xiao. *LSUN: Construction of a large-scale image dataset using deep learning with humans in the loop*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.03365, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
