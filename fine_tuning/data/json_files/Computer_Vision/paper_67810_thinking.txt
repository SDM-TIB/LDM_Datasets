To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Single Plane Wave Takes a Shortcut to Plane Wave Compounding in Ultrasound Imaging" by Zhiqiang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the body of the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges in ultrasound imaging and the use of deep learning models, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets yet. I will continue to the **methods section** where they describe their approach in detail.

In **section 2.3 (Accelerated sampling PWC via single PW)**, the authors mention using a training dataset comprised of B-mode images compounded with 75 plane waves (PWs). This indicates that they have a specific dataset they are working with, but I need to find more details about it.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** where they describe the in vivo datasets used for their evaluations. They state that they acquired 300 frames of channel RF data from the right carotid artery of two healthy volunteers, which were used to create a test dataset of 100 frames for the reconstruction process. This is a critical dataset for their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to various studies and methods, but I need to ensure I capture the correct citations for the datasets they utilized.

1. **Training Dataset**: The authors used B-mode images compounded with 75 PWs. However, they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset in the paper. I will note that this dataset is derived from their own experimental setup.

2. **In Vivo Dataset**: The authors describe the in vivo dataset as consisting of 300 frames of RF data from the right carotid artery of two healthy volunteers. Again, there is no specific citation provided for this dataset, as it is part of their original research.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for the datasets they created or used, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Training Dataset**: B-mode images compounded with 75 PWs (no formal citation).
- **In Vivo Dataset**: 300 frames of RF data from the right carotid artery of two healthy volunteers (no formal citation).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines the datasets, even though formal citations are not available for them. This will ensure that the datasets are documented properly for future reference or analysis.
