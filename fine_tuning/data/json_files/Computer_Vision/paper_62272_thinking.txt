To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robustness of Segment Anything Model (SAM) for Autonomous Driving in Adverse Weather Conditions" by Xinru Shan and Chaoning Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the introduction and experiment sections are likely to contain specific references to datasets used in the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its applications in autonomous driving, but they do not mention specific datasets here. I will need to look further into the **experiment evaluation section**.

In **section 3 (Experiment Evaluation)**, the authors explicitly mention the **BDD100k** dataset. They describe it as a large-scale vision dataset for autonomous driving, which includes diverse high-resolution images captured from urban driving scenarios. The authors note that they selected 100 images under normal weather conditions from the validation subset of BDD100k to evaluate the segmentation robustness of SAM.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the BDD100k dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- For **BDD100k**:
  > Fisher Yu, Haofeng Chen, Xin Wang, Wenqi Xian, Yingying Chen, Fangchen Liu, Vashisht Madhavan, and Trevor Darrell. *BDD100K: A Diverse Driving Dataset for Heterogeneous Multitask Learning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 2636â€“2645, 2020.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will focus on creating an entry for the BDD100k dataset.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all details are accurately captured for future reference or processing.
