To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Who Reviews The Reviewers? A Multi-Level Jury Problem" by Ben Abramowitz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often contextualizes the research and may reference datasets used in prior work or in the current study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In many research papers, authors will describe the datasets they used for their experiments in a specific section, often titled "Datasets," "Data Collection," or "Experiments." This section is crucial for identifying the datasets utilized in the study.

If the paper includes a **results or experiments section**, I will examine it closely to see if the authors discuss any datasets used for validation or testing of their proposed methods. They may provide details about the datasets, such as their size, characteristics, and how they were used in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is not explicitly cited, I will note the details provided in the text and search for the original source of the dataset if necessary.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for any required output format, ensuring that all information is clear and correctly attributed.
