To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bregman Plug-and-Play Priors" by Abdullah H. Al-Shabili et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments sections**. These sections typically detail the experimental setup and the datasets used for training and testing the proposed methods. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

In this paper, the authors discuss the application of their methods to **Poisson linear inverse problems** and **image deblurring**. They mention using public datasets such as **BSD400** for training and **Set12** for testing. I will note these datasets as they are crucial for understanding the experimental validation of the proposed methods.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For the **BSD400 dataset**, the citation is:
> Martin, D. R., Fowlkes, C. C., Tal, D., & Malik, J. (2001). *A database of human segmented images for evaluation of image segmentation algorithms*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2001.

For the **Set12 dataset**, the citation is:
> Z. Wang, A. C. Bovik, H. R. Sheikh, and E. P. Simoncelli. (2004). *Image quality assessment: From error visibility to structural similarity*. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 13(4), 600-612.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and use in future research or applications.
