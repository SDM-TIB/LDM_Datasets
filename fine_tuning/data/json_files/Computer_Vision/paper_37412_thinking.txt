To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MADE: Masked Autoencoder for Distribution Estimation" by Mathieu Germain et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the experiments were conducted on a suite of UCI binary datasets and the binarized MNIST dataset, which indicates that these datasets are likely to be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. They specifically mention two benchmarks: the UCI binary evaluation suite and the binarized MNIST dataset. I will look for a table or a list that provides details about these datasets.

In **Table 2**, the authors provide a summary of the UCI datasets, including the number of inputs and the number of examples in the train, validation, and test splits. The datasets listed are:

1. **Adult**: 
   - Number of inputs: 123
   - Train examples: 5000
   - Validation examples: 1414
   - Test examples: 26147

2. **Connect4**: 
   - Number of inputs: 126
   - Train examples: 16000
   - Validation examples: 4000
   - Test examples: 47557

3. **DNA**: 
   - Number of inputs: 180
   - Train examples: 1400
   - Validation examples: 600
   - Test examples: 1186

4. **Mushrooms**: 
   - Number of inputs: 112
   - Train examples: 2000
   - Validation examples: 500
   - Test examples: 5624

5. **NIPS-0-12**: 
   - Number of inputs: 500
   - Train examples: 400
   - Validation examples: 100
   - Test examples: 1240

6. **OCR-letters**: 
   - Number of inputs: 128
   - Train examples: 32152
   - Validation examples: 10000
   - Test examples: 150000

7. **RCV1**: 
   - Number of inputs: 150
   - Train examples: 40000
   - Validation examples: 10000
   - Test examples: 32561

8. **Web**: 
   - Number of inputs: 300
   - Train examples: 14000
   - Validation examples: 3188
   - Test examples: 32561

Additionally, the authors mention the **binarized MNIST dataset**, which consists of 70,000 handwritten digits, split into 50,000 for training, 10,000 for validation, and 10,000 for testing.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper or from known sources:

- For the **Adult dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. J. H. et al. "Adult dataset." UCI Machine Learning Repository.

- For the **Connect4 dataset**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
