To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Learning Approach to Data-driven Parameterizations for Statistical Parametric Speech Synthesis" by Prasanna Kumar Muthukumar and Alan W Black, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of deep learning algorithms for parameterization but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will look for specific mentions in the introduction and subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference the Blizzard Challenge, which indicates that datasets related to speech synthesis might be involved. However, I need to find specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors mention that they ran experiments on three different voices: the RMS and SLT voices from the CMU Arctic databases and a Hindi corpus released as part of the 2014 Blizzard Challenge. This gives me three datasets to document.

1. **CMU Arctic Database**: This dataset includes various voices for speech synthesis, specifically the RMS and SLT voices. The CMU Arctic databases are widely used in speech synthesis research.

2. **Hindi Corpus**: This dataset was released as part of the 2014 Blizzard Challenge, which is a well-known evaluation framework for text-to-speech systems.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **CMU Arctic Database**, the citation is:
  > Kominek, J., & Black, A. W. (2004). *The CMU Arctic speech databases*. In Fifth ISCA Workshop on Speech Synthesis.

- For the **Blizzard Challenge 2014**, the citation is:
  > Blizzard Challenge. (2014). Retrieved from http://www.synsig.org/index.php/Blizzard_Challenge_2014.

With these citations, I have the necessary information to describe each dataset accurately.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited.
