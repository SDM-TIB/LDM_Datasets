To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic brain tumor grading from MRI data using convolutional neural networks and quality assessment" by SÃ©rgio Pereira et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of MRI data for tumor grading, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the importance of tumor grading and the challenges associated with traditional methods. They reference the **BRATS 2017 Training set** as a dataset used for evaluation, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

In the **methods section**, I will look for any specific details about how the dataset is utilized. The authors mention that the BRATS 2017 Training set consists of 285 pre-operative acquisitions, organized according to tumor grade into high-grade gliomas (HGG) and low-grade gliomas (LGG). This section provides valuable context about the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any additional insights or metrics related to the dataset. They present quantitative results for tumor grade prediction using the BRATS dataset, confirming its significance in their study.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the BRATS 2017 Training set. The citation is as follows:
> Bakas, S., et al. "Advancing the cancer genome atlas glioma MRI collections with expert segmentation labels and radiomic features." *Scientific Data* 4 (2017).

Since the BRATS dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the BRATS 2017 Training set, ensuring that it is ready for review or further processing.
