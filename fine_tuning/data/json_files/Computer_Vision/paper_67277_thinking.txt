To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving the Generalization of Segmentation Foundation Model under Distribution Shift via Weakly Supervised Adaptation" by Haojie Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their method on **five types of downstream segmentation tasks**, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention five types of downstream segmentation tasks and provide a table (Table 1) that outlines the datasets used for each task. The datasets listed are:

1. **COCO**: Used for natural images.
2. **Pascal VOC**: Another dataset for natural images.
3. **COCO-C**: Used for corrupted images.
4. **kvasir-SEG**: Used for medical images.
5. **ISIC**: Another dataset for medical images.
6. **CHAMELEON**: Used for camouflaged objects.
7. **CAMO**: Also used for camouflaged objects.
8. **COD10K**: Used for camouflaged objects.
9. **OCID**: Used for robotic images.
10. **OSD**: Another dataset for robotic images.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution. 

For example, I will look for the following datasets:

- **COCO**: The citation is:

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
