To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HeadSculpt: Crafting 3D Head Avatars with Text" by Xiao Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for what the authors are addressing. The introduction often discusses related works and may reference datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly looking for any mention of datasets used for training or evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using a **tiny dataset** consisting of 34 images of the back view of human heads to train a special token for their model. This is a specific dataset that I need to note.

I will also check the **experiments section** for any additional datasets that may have been used for evaluation or comparison. The authors might reference other datasets when discussing their results or comparing their method to existing approaches.

After identifying the datasets, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

For the dataset I identified:
1. **Tiny Dataset for Back View of Heads**: This dataset was collected to train a special token for the model. The authors mention that it consists of 34 images depicting the back view of human heads, selected to encompass a diverse range of characteristics.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset. Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for this tiny dataset, I will note that it is a custom dataset created by the authors for their specific research purpose.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for any required output format, ensuring that all relevant information is included for future reference or processing.
