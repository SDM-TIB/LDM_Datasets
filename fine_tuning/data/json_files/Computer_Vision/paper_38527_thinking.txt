To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarially Learned Anomaly Detection" by Houssam Zenati et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors achieve state-of-the-art performance on a range of image and tabular datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section V (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention four datasets:

1. **KDDCup99 10% dataset**: This dataset is described as a network intrusion dataset with 494,021 instances and 121 features.
2. **Arrhythmia dataset**: This dataset consists of 452 instances with 274 features, focusing on data related to cardiac arrhythmia.
3. **SVHN dataset**: This dataset contains images of house numbers, with a total of 99,289 instances and 3072 features.
4. **CIFAR-10 dataset**: This dataset includes 60,000 images across 10 classes, also with 3072 features.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **KDDCup99 dataset**:
  > M. Lichman, “UCI machine learning repository,” 2013. [Online]. Available: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml

- For the **Arrhythmia dataset**:
  > A. A. P. M. A. Pimentel, D. A. Clifton, L. Clifton, and L. Tarassenko, “A review of novelty detection,” Signal Processing, vol. 99, pp. 215 – 249, 2014.

- For the **SVHN dataset**:
  > Y. Netzer, T. Wang, A. Coates, A. Bissacco, B. Wu, and A. Y. Ng, “Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning,” in NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning, 2011.

- For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**:
  > A. Krizhevsky, “Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images,” Technical Report, 2012.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research in the field.
