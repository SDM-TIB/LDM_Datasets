To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust outlier detection by de-biasing VAE likelihoods" by Kushal Chauhan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art accuracies with "nine grayscale and natural image datasets," which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors detail the datasets used for training and testing their models. In this section, they mention:

1. **Grayscale Datasets**:
   - **MNIST**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits.
   - **Fashion-MNIST**: A dataset of clothing items, serving as a drop-in replacement for MNIST.
   - **EMNIST (Letters)**: An extension of MNIST that includes handwritten letters.
   - **Sign Language MNIST**: A dataset of sign language gestures.

2. **Natural Image Datasets**:
   - **SVHN (Street View House Numbers)**: A dataset of house numbers from Google Street View images.
   - **CelebA**: A large-scale face attributes dataset.
   - **ComprehensiveCars**: A dataset of traffic surveillance images of cars.
   - **GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark)**: A dataset for traffic sign recognition.
   - **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.

The authors also mention using a "gray-noise" dataset and a "color-noise" dataset for outlier detection, which are not standard datasets but rather generated noise datasets.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
