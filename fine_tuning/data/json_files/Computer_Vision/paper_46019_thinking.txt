To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A generative angular model of protein structure evolution" by Michael Golden et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of a training dataset of 1200 homologous protein pairs from the HOMSTRAD database, which is a potential dataset of interest.

Next, I will look into the **methods** section, particularly the **training and test dataset** subsection, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **Training Dataset**: A dataset of 1200 protein pairs (2400 proteins; 417,870 site observation pairs) assembled from 1032 protein families in the HOMSTRAD database.
2. **Test Dataset**: A dataset of 38 protein pairs (76 proteins; 14,125 site observation pairs) also derived from the HOMSTRAD database.

I will also check the **references** section to find the full citations for the HOMSTRAD database, as it is crucial to provide proper citations for the datasets.

The citation for the HOMSTRAD database is:
> Mizuguchi, K., Deane, C. M., Blundell, T. L., and Overington, J. P. (1998). Homstrad: a database of protein structure alignments for homologous families. *Protein Science*, 7(11), 2469–2471.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset. The datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **HOMSTRAD Training Dataset**: 1200 homologous protein pairs used for training the model.
   - Citation: Mizuguchi, K., Deane, C. M., Blundell, T. L., and Overington, J. P. (1998). Homstrad: a database of protein structure alignments for homologous families. *Protein Science*, 7(11), 2469–2471.

2. **HOMSTRAD Test Dataset**: 38 homologous protein pairs used for testing the model.
   - Citation: Mizuguchi, K., Deane, C. M., Blundell, T. L., and Overington, J. P. (1998). Homstrad: a database of protein structure alignments for homologous families. *Protein Science*, 7(11), 2469–2471.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clearly documented and ready for further processing or review.
