To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deformably-Scaled Transposed Convolution" by Stefano B. Blumberg et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method across various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets or references to datasets in these sections.

Next, I will move to the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will pay close attention to any subsections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." 

In section 4.1, the authors discuss their experiments with **COCO 2017** for object detection and instance segmentation, and **VOC 2012** for semantic segmentation. They also mention using **CelebA** for image generation tasks and a dataset for 3D diffusion MRI enhancement, which is based on the **Human Connectome Project**.

I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **COCO 2017**: This dataset is used for object detection and instance segmentation tasks. It contains 118K training images and 5K validation images.
   - Full citation:

2. **VOC 2012**: This dataset is used for semantic segmentation tasks, containing 10,582 images.
   - Full citation:

3. **CelebA**: This dataset is used for generating synthetic faces in the DCGAN experiments.
   - Full citation: 
     > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In: International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015.

4. **Human Connectome Project**: This dataset is used for 3D diffusion MRI enhancement tasks.
   - Full citation: 
     > Stamatios Sotiropoulos, Saad Jbabdi, Junqian Xu, Jesper Andersson, Steen Moeller, Edward Auerbach, Matthew Glasser, Moises Hernandez Fernandez, Guillermo Sapiro, Mark Jenkinson, David Feinberg, Essa Yacoub, Christophe Lenglet, Van DC, Kamil Ugurbil, and Timothy Behrens. *Advances in diffusion MRI acquisition and processing in the human connectome project*. NeuroImage, 80:125, 2013.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately noted the full citations for each dataset, as they are crucial for proper referencing. Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
