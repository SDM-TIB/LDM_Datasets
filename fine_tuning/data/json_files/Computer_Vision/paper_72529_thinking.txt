To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RTF: Region-based Table Filling Method for Relational Triple Extraction" by Ning An et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method achieves state-of-the-art performance on "three variants of two widely used benchmark datasets." This indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to identify.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors state that they conducted experiments on two benchmark datasets: **NYT** and **WebNLG**. They also mention variants of these datasets, such as NYT-R and WebNLG-R, which are rearranged versions of the original datasets.

To gather more details about these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. Here, I will find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations are as follows:

- For the **NYT dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sebastian Riedel, Limin Yao, and Andrew McCallum. *Modeling relations and their mentions without labeled text*. In Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases, European Conference, ECML PKDD 2010, pages 148–163, 2010.

- For the **WebNLG dataset**, the citation is:
  > Claire Gardent, Anastasia Shimorina, Shashi Narayan, and Laura Perez-Beltrachini. *Creating training corpora for nlg micro-planning*. In 55th annual meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2017.

- For the **NYT-R dataset**, which is a rearranged version of the NYT dataset, the citation is:
  > Juhyuk Lee, Min-Joong Lee, June Yong Yang, and Eunho Yang. *Does it really generalize well on unseen data? systematic evaluation of relational triple extraction methods*. In Proceedings of the 2022 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, NAACL 2022, pages 3849–3858, 2022.

- For the **WebNLG-R dataset**, which is a rearranged version of the WebNLG dataset, the citation is also:
  > Juhyuk Lee, Min-Joong Lee, June Yong Yang, and Eunho Yang. *Does it really generalize well on unseen data? systematic evaluation of relational triple extraction methods*. In Proceedings of the 2022 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, NAACL 2022, pages 3849–3858, 2022.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset along with its citation.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **NYT Dataset** - Citation: Riedel et al. (2010)
2. **WebNLG Dataset** - Citation: Gardent et al. (2017)
3. **NYT-R Dataset** - Citation: Lee et al. (2022)
4. **WebNLG-R Dataset** - Citation: Lee et al. (2022)

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their full citations for further use or analysis.
