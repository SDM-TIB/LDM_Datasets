To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding the Diffusion Models by Conditional Expectations" by Yubin Lu, Zhongjian Wang, and Guillaume Bal, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not contain specific dataset names. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments** sections, as these are likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that the authors may have used for their analyses or experiments. If the authors mention specific datasets or benchmarks, I will take note of their names and any relevant details provided.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this section typically outlines the methodologies used and the datasets employed in the experiments. I will look for any subsections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Data Collection." If the authors describe the datasets, I will extract the following information for each dataset:
- Name of the dataset
- Description of the dataset (e.g., size, type of data, purpose)
- Any specific metrics or characteristics mentioned

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will look for the original papers or sources where the datasets were introduced or described.

For each dataset, I will compile the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief summary of what the dataset contains and its relevance to the research.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, formatted according to academic standards.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its name, description, and citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets into a structured format for easy reference and review.
