To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MetaDiffuser: Diffusion Model as Conditional Planner for Offline Meta-RL" by Fei Ni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the experiments were conducted on **MuJoCo benchmarks**, which suggests that datasets related to these benchmarks are likely included.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors describe their experiments on various tasks, specifically mentioning **Point-Robot**, **Cheetah**, **Ant**, **Hopper**, and **Walker** environments. These are indicative of the datasets used for the experiments.

In the **environment settings subsection**, the authors provide details about the environments used for testing. They mention that the **Point-Robot** environment is a 2D navigation task, while the **Cheetah**, **Ant**, **Hopper**, and **Walker** environments are part of the MuJoCo control tasks. This indicates that the datasets for these environments are derived from the MuJoCo physics engine.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific dataset citations, but I can infer the following based on the environments described:

1. **MuJoCo**: The datasets for the MuJoCo environments are typically derived from the MuJoCo physics engine, which is widely used in reinforcement learning research. The citation for the MuJoCo simulator is:
   > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pp. 5026-5033.

2. **Point-Robot**: This environment is often used in meta-reinforcement learning studies. The specific dataset citation may not be available, but it is commonly referenced in the context of offline RL. A relevant citation is:
   > Rakelly, K., Zhou, A., Quillen, D., Finn, C., & Levine, S. (2019). *Efficient Off-Policy Meta-Reinforcement Learning via Probabilistic Context Variables*. In Proceedings of the 36th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), pp. 5321-5330.

3. **Cheetah, Ant, Hopper, and Walker**: These environments are part of the MuJoCo suite, and their datasets are typically referenced collectively. The citation for the MuJoCo environments is:
   > Yu, T., Quillen, D., He, Z., Julian, R., Hausman, K., Finn, C., & Levine, S. (2020). *Meta-world: A benchmark and evaluation for multi-task and meta reinforcement learning*. In Conference on Robot Learning, pp. 1094-1100.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is properly cited according to the references provided in the paper and the relevant literature.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper include:
- **MuJoCo environments** (general reference)
- **Point-Robot** (Rakelly et al., 2019)
- **Cheetah, Ant, Hopper, and Walker** (Yu et al., 2020)

Now, I will prepare the structured output for these datasets, ensuring that each entry includes the full citation as required.
