To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporal Animal Behavior Grounding with Positional Recovery Training" by Sheng Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the **Animal Kingdom dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges of temporal grounding in animal behavior data. They reference the **Animal Kingdom dataset** again, providing context about its significance in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1**, the authors provide detailed information about the **Animal Kingdom dataset**. They describe it as containing frame-level natural language descriptions of wildlife behavior, comprising 50 hours of video across 4,301 long video sequences and 18,744 annotated sentences. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set, which is crucial for understanding its structure and usage.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Animal Kingdom dataset**. The citation provided in the references is:

> Xun Long Ng, Kian Eng Ong, Qichen Zheng, Yun Ni, Si Yong Yeo, and Jun Liu. *Animal kingdom: A large and diverse dataset for animal behavior understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2022, pp. 19023â€“19034.

Since the **Animal Kingdom dataset** is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation.

After completing these steps, I will ensure that the dataset entry is ready for review or further processing, maintaining a clear and organized presentation of the extracted information.
