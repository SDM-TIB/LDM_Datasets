To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accelerating Large-Kernel Convolution Using Summed-Area Tables" by Linguang Zhang, Maciej Halber, and Szymon Rusinkiewicz, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed method to human pose estimation, which suggests that datasets related to this task may be included.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention that they tested their method on two datasets: **MPII Human Pose** and **Microsoft COCO**.

In the **MPII Human Pose Dataset section**, the authors provide a description of the dataset, stating that it consists of around 25,000 images extracted from online videos, with annotations for over 40,000 people. This dataset is commonly used for human pose estimation tasks.

In the **Microsoft COCO section**, the authors describe it as containing over 200,000 images and 250,000 person instances, with annotations for 17 joints per person. This dataset is also widely recognized in the field for multi-person pose estimation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **MPII Human Pose Dataset**, the citation is:
   > Mykhaylo Andriluka, Leonid Pishchulin, Peter Gehler, and Bernt Schiele. *2D human pose estimation: New benchmark and state of the art analysis*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3686–3693, 2014.

2. For the **Microsoft COCO Dataset**, the citation is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation for proper attribution. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
