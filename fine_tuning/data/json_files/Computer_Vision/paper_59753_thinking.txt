To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval with Textual Inversion" by Alberto Baldrati et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors introduce a new dataset called **CIRCO**, which is specifically designed for the task of Composed Image Retrieval (CIR). This is a strong indication that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will look into the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the limitations of existing datasets and mention that CIRCO is the first dataset for CIR that contains multiple ground truths for each query. This section also references other datasets used in their experiments, such as **FashionIQ** and **CIRR**.

In the **section detailing the CIRCO dataset**, the authors provide a comprehensive description of the dataset, including its structure, the number of queries, and the annotation process. They mention that CIRCO consists of 1020 queries with a total of 4624 ground truths, which is crucial information for documenting the dataset.

Additionally, I will check the **experiments section** where the authors report results on the datasets used. They mention that their approach is evaluated on **FashionIQ**, **CIRR**, and the proposed **CIRCO** dataset. This confirms that these datasets are integral to their research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **References section**:

1. **CIRCO Dataset**: The authors created this dataset, so I will cite it as follows:
   > Baldrati, A., Agnolucci, L., Bertini, M., & Del Bimbo, A. (2023). *Composed Image Retrieval on Common Objects in context (CIRCO)*. Available at: https://github.com/miccunifi/CIRCO.

2. **FashionIQ Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Wu, H., Gao, Y., Guo, X., Al-Halah, Z., Rennie, S., Grauman, K., & Feris, R. (2021). *Fashion IQ: A new dataset towards retrieving images by natural language feedback*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 11307–11317.

3. **CIRR Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Liu, Z., Rodriguez-Opazo, C., Teney, D., & Gould, S. (2021). *Image retrieval on real-life images with pre-trained vision-and-language models*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2125–2134.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
