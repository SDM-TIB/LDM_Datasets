To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Asymmetric GAN for Unpaired Image-to-image Translation" by Yu Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors verify their method on the **Cityscapes** and **Helen** datasets, indicating that these are the primary datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** for detailed descriptions of these datasets. In the experiments, the authors explicitly state that they conduct evaluations on the **Cityscapes dataset**, which consists of 2,975 training images and 500 validation images for semantic segmentation tasks, and the **Helen dataset**, which is used for face parsing and contains 2,000 training images and 100 validation images.

I will also look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

For the **Cityscapes dataset**, the citation is:
> Cordts, M., Omran, M., Ramos, S., Rehfeld, T., & Hutter, F. (2016). The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 3213-3223.

For the **Helen dataset**, the citation is:
> Smith, B. M., Zhang, L., & et al. (2013). Exemplar-based Face Parsing. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 3484-3491.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **Cityscapes Dataset**: Used for semantic segmentation, consisting of 2,975 training images and 500 validation images.
   - Citation: Cordts, M., Omran, M., Ramos, S., Rehfeld, T., & Hutter, F. (2016). The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 3213-3223.

2. **Helen Dataset**: Used for face parsing, containing 2,000 training images and 100 validation images.
   - Citation: Smith, B. M., Zhang, L., & et al. (2013). Exemplar-based Face Parsing. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 3484-3491.

With this information, I am ready to format the dataset entries as needed for downstream processing or review.
