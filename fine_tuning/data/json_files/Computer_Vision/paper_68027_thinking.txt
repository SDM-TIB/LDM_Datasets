To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Align Your Gaussians: Text-to-4D with Dynamic 3D Gaussians and Composed Diffusion Models" by Huan Ling et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of "text-guided diffusion models" and "dynamic 3D objects," which suggests that datasets related to these models may be discussed. I will look for any specific dataset names or references in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **background** and **related work** sections. These sections often provide context and may reference datasets used in previous studies. I will pay attention to any datasets that are cited or described, particularly those that are foundational to the research presented in this paper.

I will then move on to the **experiments** section, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. This section may also provide insights into how the datasets were utilized in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references** section to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. It is crucial to ensure that I have the correct and complete citations, as these will be necessary for proper attribution.

For example, if I find that the paper references a dataset like "WebVid-10M," I will look for its citation in the references section, which might look something like this:
> Max Bain, Arsha Nagrani, GÃ¼l Varol, and Andrew Zisserman. *Frozen in Time: A Joint Video and Image Encoder for End-to-End Retrieval*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the full citations for each dataset, as this is a critical aspect of the extraction process. This will involve double-checking the formatting and completeness of each citation to adhere to academic standards.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract the datasets from the paper effectively and provide accurate citations for each one.
