To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Applied Awareness: Test-Driven GUI Development using Computer Vision and Cryptography" by Donald Beaver, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses a novel approach to GUI testing but does not specify any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the challenges of GUI testing and mentions the use of image classification but does not name any datasets either.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Case Study)**, which details the implementation of a GUI and mentions a "designer spec" and a "backend model representation." Here, the author describes using a Keynote slide deck as a design spec, which is not a dataset in the traditional sense but rather a tool for creating synthetic test cases. The section states that 90 slides were used as synthetic test cases, but it does not provide a formal dataset citation.

In **section 4.1 (Test-Driven Design Phase)**, the author mentions that the design spec was expanded to 90 slides, with 30 for each warning condition (nominal, caution, danger). However, these slides are not a dataset in the conventional sense, as they are not publicly available datasets but rather custom-created materials for the study.

I will also check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited. However, the references primarily consist of papers and articles related to GUI testing and cryptography, with no specific datasets mentioned.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that there are no formal datasets provided that can be cited in a traditional manner. The author discusses the creation of synthetic images and the use of a Keynote slide deck for testing, but these do not constitute publicly available datasets with formal citations.

In conclusion, I will document that while the paper discusses the creation of synthetic test cases and the use of a design spec, it does not provide any formal datasets or citations for datasets that can be extracted. Therefore, I will note that no datasets are available for citation from this paper.
