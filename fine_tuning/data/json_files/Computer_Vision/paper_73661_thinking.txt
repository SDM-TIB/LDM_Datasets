To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Direct Alignment of Language Models via Quality-Aware Self-Refinement" by Runsheng Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that they evaluate their methods on "three widely-used benchmark datasets." This indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to identify.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.1 (Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **MT-Bench**: A multi-turn question set covering various topics such as writing, roleplay, extraction, reasoning, math, and coding.
2. **Vicuna-Bench**: A single-turn question set that includes similar topics as MT-Bench.
3. **Open-LLM Leaderboard**: This includes several datasets for commonsense reasoning, multi-task language understanding, human falsehood mimic, and math problem solving.

I will then gather more details about each dataset from the text. For instance, the authors provide a brief description of the types of tasks each dataset covers, which is crucial for understanding their context and application.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **MT-Bench**, the citation is:
  > Lianmin Zheng, Wei-Lin Chiang, Ying Sheng, Siyuan Zhuang, Zhanghao Wu, Yonghao Zhuang, Zi Lin, Zhuohan Li, Dacheng Li, Eric Xing, et al. *Judging LLM-as-a-judge with MT-Bench and Chatbot Arena*. In NeurIPS, 2023.

- For **Vicuna-Bench**, the citation is:
  > Wei-Lin Chiang, Zhuohan Li, Zi Lin, Ying Sheng, Zhanghao Wu, Hao Zhang, Lianmin Zheng, Siyuan Zhuang, Yonghao Zhuang, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Ion Stoica, and Eric P. Xing. *Vicuna: An open-source chatbot impressing GPT-4 with 90%* ChatGPT quality*. March 2023.

- For the **Open-LLM Leaderboard**, the citation is:
  > Edward Beeching, Cl√©mentine Fourrier, Nathan Habib, Sheon Han, Nathan Lambert, Nazneen Rajani, Omar Sanseviero, Lewis Tunstall, and Thomas Wolf. *Open LLM leaderboard*. https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard, 2023.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
