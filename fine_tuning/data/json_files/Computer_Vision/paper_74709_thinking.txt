To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal estimation in spatially distributed systems: how far to share measurements from?" by Juncal Arbelaiz et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or case studies.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly the sections that discuss the experiments or case studies. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of measurements, or specific conditions under which the data was collected.

In this paper, the authors discuss two case studies: one involving a **diffusion process** and another involving the **linearized Swift-Hohenberg equation**. I will check if these case studies reference specific datasets or if they are based on simulated data.

After identifying any datasets, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper references datasets from previous works, I will ensure to include those citations in the final output. If the datasets are original to this study, I will summarize their characteristics based on the descriptions provided in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that full citations are included for any referenced datasets. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration or replication of the study.
