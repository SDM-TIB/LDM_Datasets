To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combining unsupervised and supervised learning for predicting the final stroke lesion" by Adriano Pinto et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on the **ISLES 2017 testing dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the study.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for evaluation. Here, they provide information about the **ISLES 2017 dataset**, which consists of 75 ischaemic stroke patients, divided into training and testing sets. The training set includes 43 patients, while the testing set has 32 patients. Each patient is characterized by six 3D parametric MRI maps, including ADC, rCBF, rCBV, TTP, MTT, and Tmax, along with manual delineation of the lesion.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ISLES 2017 dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:
> Kistler, M., Bonaretti, S., Pfahrer, M., Niklaus, R., BÃ¼chler, P. (2013). The virtual skeleton database: an open access repository for biomedical research and collaboration. Journal of medical Internet research, 15.

Since the authors do not provide a specific citation for the ISLES 2017 dataset itself, I will use the reference to the online platform where the dataset can be accessed:
> SMIR Online Platform. (2017). Ischemic stroke lesion segmentation 2017. Retrieved from https://www.smir.ch/ISLES/Start2017.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets as required.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the **ISLES 2017 dataset**, which is essential for the evaluation of the proposed method. The full citation for the dataset is noted, along with the relevant details about its composition and characteristics.
