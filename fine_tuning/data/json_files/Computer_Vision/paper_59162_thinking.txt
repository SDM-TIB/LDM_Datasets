To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MOSO: Decomposing MOtion, Scene and Object for Video Prediction" by Mingzhen Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks for video prediction and unconditional video generation. This indicates that there are datasets involved, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors state that they conducted experiments on five challenging benchmarks: **BAIR, RoboNet, KTH, KITTI, and UCF101**. I will note these names as potential datasets.

To ensure I have the correct details, I will check the **References section** of the paper for full citations of these datasets. Here’s what I find:

1. **BAIR Dataset**: 
   > Frederik Ebert, Chelsea Finn, Alex X. Lee, and Sergey Levine. *Self-supervised visual planning with temporal skip connections*. In Conference on Robot Learning, volume 78, pages 344–356, 2017.

2. **RoboNet Dataset**: 
   > Sudeep Dasari, Frederik Ebert, Stephen Tian, Suraj Nair, Bernadette Bucher, Karl Schmeckpeper, Siddharth Singh, Sergey Levine, and Chelsea Finn. *RoboNet: Large-scale multi-robot learning*. In Conference on Robot Learning, volume 100, pages 885–897, 2019.

3. **KTH Dataset**: 
   > Christian Schuldt, Ivan Laptev, and Barbara Caputo. *Recognizing human actions: A local SVM approach*. In International Conference on Pattern Recognition, pages 32–36, 2004.

4. **KITTI Dataset**: 
   > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, Christoph Stiller, and Raquel Urtasun. *Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, 32(11):1231–1237, 2013.

5. **UCF101 Dataset**: 
   > Khurram Soomro, Amir Roshan Zamir, and Mubarak Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. CoRR, abs/1212.0402, 2012.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be clearly described along with its full citation to ensure proper attribution.
