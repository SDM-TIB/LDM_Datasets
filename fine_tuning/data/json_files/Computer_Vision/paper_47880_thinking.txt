To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EVALUATION OF (GPS/GLONASS) PATCH VERSUS RF GPS (L1) PATCH ANTENNA PERFORMANCE PARAMETER" by Gholam Aghashirin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets or experimental setups.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the context and objectives of their research. Here, they mention the comparison of two types of antennas: the RF GPS L1 passive patch antenna and the active GPS/GLONASS patch antenna. I will look for any specific datasets or performance metrics related to these antennas.

In the **methodology section**, I will pay close attention to any experimental setups, simulations, or measurements that involve datasets. The authors describe the use of FEKO simulation software for modeling and evaluating the antennas. I will look for any specific parameters or datasets that were used in these simulations.

As I analyze the paper, I will also check the **results section** for any tables or figures that present data related to the performance of the antennas. This may include passive gain measurements, frequency responses, or other relevant metrics.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or studies that are mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

For this paper, I anticipate that the datasets will include:

1. **RF GPS L1 Passive Patch Antenna Data**: This may include performance metrics such as passive gain, operating frequency, and physical dimensions.
2. **Active GPS/GLONASS Patch Antenna Data**: Similar metrics as above, including passive gain and operating frequency.

I will ensure to document the full citations for any datasets or references used in the study, as this is essential for academic integrity and further research.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
