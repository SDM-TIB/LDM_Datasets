To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Learning Optical Flow via Dilated Networks and Occlusion Reasoning" by Yi Zhu and Shawn Newsam, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the proposed method is evaluated on the **KITTI benchmark**, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **SYNTHIA**: This dataset is described as synthetic and consists of driving scenes. The authors specify that they use the left images from various views across different seasonal scenarios, amounting to 74,000 image pairs.

2. **KITTI raw dataset**: This dataset is real-world and contains around 72,000 image pairs, following a specific split referenced in the paper.

The authors also mention that they perform evaluations using the **KITTI 2012** and **KITTI 2015 benchmarks**, which are subsets of the KITTI dataset used for benchmarking optical flow estimation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SYNTHIA**, the citation is:
  > Ros, G., Sellart, L., Materzynska, J., Lopes, F., & D. J. (2016). *SYNTHIA: A Large Dataset for Semantic Segmentation of Urban Scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3234-3243.

- For **KITTI dataset**, the citation is:

With these citations, I can now compile the dataset entries. I will ensure that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
