To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards A Robust Group-level Emotion Recognition via Uncertainty-Aware Learning" by Qing Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "three widely used databases," which indicates that there are datasets relevant to their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the provided text, the authors specifically mention two databases: **GAFF2** and **GAFF3**. I will note down the details about these datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide statistics for the GAFF databases, indicating the number of samples categorized into positive, neutral, and negative emotions. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' structure and purpose.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations will provide the necessary details for proper attribution. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **GAFF2 Database**:
  > Dhall, A., Goecke, R., Ghosh, S., Joshi, J., Hoey, J., & Gedeon, T. (2017). From individual to group-level emotion recognition: Emotiw 5.0. In Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction (pp. 524–528).

- For **GAFF3 Database**:
  > Dhall, A., Kaur, A., Goecke, R., & Gedeon, T. (2018). Emotiw 2018: Audio-video, student engagement and group-level affect prediction. In Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction (pp. 653–656).

Finally, I will compile the extracted information about each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of group-level emotion recognition.
