To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reduce Computational Complexity for Convolutional Layers by Skipping Zeros" by Zhiyi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets used for validation or comparison.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using **Cifar10** and **ILSVRC2012** datasets for training their convolutional neural networks (CNNs). I will take note of these datasets and look for any specific details provided about them, such as their characteristics or how they were utilized in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets easily. 

For the **Cifar10 dataset**, the citation is:
> A. Krizhevsky, “Cifar10,” [Online]. Available: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

For the **ILSVRC2012 dataset**, the citation is:
> Fei-Fei Li, “IMAGENET,” [Online]. Available: https://image-net.org.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly describes each dataset, including its name, description, and full citation.

This process ensures that I have accurately extracted the relevant datasets from the paper while providing the necessary citations for future reference.
