To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OMEGAS: Object Mesh Extraction from Large Scenes Guided by Gaussian Segmentation" by Lizhi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a framework for 3D reconstruction, but it does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **experiments section** for more concrete information.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors state that they tested their method on scenes presented in the **LERF-MASK dataset** and **Mip-NeRF360**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for additional details about these datasets in the text. The authors mention that they also take diverse 3D scene cases from **LERF**, **Tanks&Temples**, and **Instruct-NeRF2NeRF** for visual comparison. This suggests that these datasets are relevant to their experiments as well.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

1. **LERF-MASK dataset**: The citation is:

2. **Mip-NeRF360**: The citation is:

3. **LERF dataset**: The citation is:

4. **Tanks&Temples dataset**: The citation is:

5. **Instruct-NeRF2NeRF dataset**: The citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and attributed according to the references provided in the paper. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets utilized in the research.
