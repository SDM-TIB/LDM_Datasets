To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Morphology Focused Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Synthesis of Histopathology Images" by Puria Azadi Moghadam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors synthesized histopathology images and conducted experiments, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Evaluation and Results)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Data)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention utilizing a dataset of **344 whole slide images (WSIs)** of low-grade gliomas from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) archive. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

The authors provide details about the dataset, including the breakdown of cases based on genomic subtypes:
- **297 cases with IDH mutations**
- **47 IDH Wild Type cases**
- Further division of IDH mutant slides into two groups based on chromosomal codeletion.

The paper also states that each slide is pixel-wise annotated, which adds to the dataset's significance for training their models.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the dataset mentioned. The authors reference the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) archive, which is a well-known resource. The citation for the TCGA dataset is as follows:
> Robert L. Grossman, Allison P. Heath, Vincent Ferretti, Harold E. Varmus, Douglas R. Lowy, Warren A. Kibbe, and Louis M. Staudt. *Toward a shared vision for cancer genomic data*. New England Journal of Medicine, 375(12):1109–1112, 2016.

Additionally, I will note that the authors mention the use of mutations associated with each patient obtained from cbioportal, which is another relevant dataset. The citation for cbioportal is:
> Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. *Comprehensive, integrative genomic analysis of diffuse lower-grade gliomas*. New England Journal of Medicine, 372(26):2481–2498, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
