To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GMValuator: Similarity-based Data Valuation for Generative Models" by Jiaxi Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions that GMVALUATOR is evaluated on various datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to identify.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section V), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention that they conduct experiments on several benchmark datasets, including:

1. **MNIST**: A dataset consisting of grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) with a resolution of 28x28 pixels. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

2. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 color images in 10 different classes, with each image having a resolution of 32x32 pixels.

3. **CelebA**: A widely used face recognition dataset that contains over 200,000 celebrity images, each labeled with 40 binary attribute annotations.

4. **AFHQ**: A high-resolution image dataset focusing on animal faces, consisting of images with a resolution of 512x512 pixels.

5. **FFHQ**: A high-resolution face dataset containing high-quality images of human faces with a resolution of 1024x1024 pixels.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
