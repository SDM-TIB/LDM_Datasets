To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CleanDiffuser: An Easy-to-use Modularized Library for Diffusion Models in Decision Making" by Zibin Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted comprehensive evaluations across various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in these sections.

Next, I will move to the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as well as any textual descriptions that provide details about them.

In **Appendix C**, the authors provide additional details about the datasets used in their experiments. This section is crucial as it often contains specific information about the datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant citations.

From my reading, I identify the following datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **D4RL Benchmark**: This benchmark includes various offline reinforcement learning tasks and is referenced multiple times throughout the paper. The authors mention that they evaluate their algorithms on this benchmark, which consists of several datasets for locomotion, manipulation, and navigation tasks.

2. **Franka Kitchen Dataset**: This dataset is specifically mentioned in the context of controlling a robot arm to complete household tasks. The authors describe the dataset's characteristics and the types of tasks it includes.

3. **Antmaze Dataset**: This dataset is used for maze navigation tasks and is noted for its challenging nature due to sparse rewards.

4. **PushT Dataset**: This dataset is used for imitation learning tasks and is described in detail in the experiments section.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper. The citations are as follows:

- For **D4RL Benchmark**:
  > Justin Fu, Aviral Kumar, Ofir Nachum, George Tucker, and Sergey Levine. *D4RL: Datasets for deep data-driven reinforcement learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219, 2020.

- For **Franka Kitchen Dataset**:
  > Abhishek Gupta, Vikash Kumar, Corey Lynch, Sergey Levine, and Karol Hausman. *Relay policy learning: Solving long-horizon tasks via imitation and reinforcement learning*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Robot Learning, CoRL, 2020.

- For **Antmaze Dataset**:
  > Justin Fu, Aviral Kumar, Ofir Nachum, George Tucker, and Sergey Levine. *D4RL: Datasets for deep data-driven reinforcement learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219, 2020.

- For **PushT Dataset**:
  > Pete Florence, Corey Lynch, Andy Zeng, Oscar A Ramirez, Ayzaan Wahid, Laura Downs, Adrian Wong, Johnny Lee, Igor Mordatch, and Jonathan Tompson. *Implicit behavioral cloning*. In Conference on Robot Learning, CoRL, 2022.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured for future reference or processing.
