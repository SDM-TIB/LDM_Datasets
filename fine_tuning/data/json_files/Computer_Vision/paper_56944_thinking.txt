To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine Learning Methods Applied to Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potentials Aid in Localizing Seizure Onset Zones" by Ian G. Malone et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, data collection, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of machine learning classifiers to localize seizure onset zones (SOZ) from cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs), which suggests that a dataset related to CCEPs is involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors provide context about epilepsy and the need for effective localization of the SOZ, but I need to look for specific dataset details in the data collection section.

In the **data collection section**, the authors describe the dataset they used, which consists of CCEP data collected from seven patients during intracranial monitoring. They mention that the dataset contains 653,764 rows and 503 columns, including time series data and metadata. This section provides a clear description of the dataset, but I need to ensure I capture the full citation for the dataset.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find any citations related to the dataset. The authors reference several studies that provide context for their methodology and dataset characteristics. However, they do not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself, as it appears to be original data collected by the authors.

Since the dataset is original and not publicly available, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset collected by the authors. I will summarize the dataset details as follows:

1. **CCEP Dataset**: This dataset consists of CCEP recordings from seven patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. It includes 653,764 rows of data, with 495 columns representing time series data (each corresponding to 495 ms) and additional metadata features. The dataset is used to train machine learning classifiers for localizing the SOZ.

Since there is no formal citation for the dataset, I will note that it is unpublished data collected by the authors.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the details and the context provided in the paper. The dataset entry will reflect that it is an original dataset created for the study, and I will include the authors' names and the title of the paper for reference.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
