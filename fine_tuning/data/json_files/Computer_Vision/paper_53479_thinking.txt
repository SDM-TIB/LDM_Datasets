To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Quality Assessment of Compressed Videos: A Subjective and Objective Study" by Liqun Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates the importance of a large-scale quality database for training video quality assessment models, which suggests that a dataset is likely discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention existing video quality databases such as LIVE Video Quality Database, LIVE Mobile VQA Database, CSIQ, IVP, and WaterlooIVC4K Video Quality Database. This is a clear indication that these datasets are relevant to the study.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any tables that summarize the datasets used in the study. In this paper, there is a **Table I** that lists existing compressed video databases, including their number of original videos, types of compression, number of compressed videos, and the year of presentation. This table provides a concise overview of the datasets.

From the table, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **LIVE Video Quality Database**: 
   - Number of original videos: 10
   - Type of compression: 2
   - Number of compressed videos: 80
   - Year of presentation: 2010
   - Citation:

2. **LIVE Mobile VQA Database**: 
   - Number of original videos: 10
   - Type of compression: 1
   - Number of compressed videos: 40
   - Year of presentation: 2012
   - Citation:

3. **CSIQ**: 
   - Number of original videos: 12
   - Type of compression: 3
   - Number of compressed videos: 108
   - Year of presentation: 2012
   - Citation:

4. **IVP**: 
   - Number of original videos: 10
   - Type of compression: 3
   - Number of compressed videos: 50
   - Year of presentation: 2012
   - Citation: 
     > T. Blu, W. Cham, K. Ngan, et al. "IVP video quality database." [Online]. Available: http://ivp.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/, 2018.

5. **WaterlooIVC4K Video Quality Database**: 
   - Number of original videos: 20
   - Type of compression: 5
   - Number of compressed videos: 1200
   - Year of presentation: 2019
   - Citation: 
     > Z. Li, Z. Duanmu, W. Liu, et al. "AVC, HEVC, VP9, AVS2 or AV1? â€” A comparative study of state-of-the-art video encoders on 4K videos." in Proc. 16th Int. Conf. Image Anal. and Recognit. (ICIAR), 2019, pp. 27-29.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy access and review, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset.
