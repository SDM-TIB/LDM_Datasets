To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Removing Dust from CMB Observations with Diffusion Models" by David Heurtel-Depeiges et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "simulated dust emission maps" and "CMB maps," which indicates that these are likely datasets of interest.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Description of the Data)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their study. Here, they mention:

1. **Dust Emission Maps**: The authors state that they constructed simulated dust emission maps from a turbulent hydrodynamic simulation of the diffuse interstellar medium taken from the CATS database. They specify that their dataset consists of 991 dust emission maps of size 256x256.

2. **CMB Maps**: The authors describe how they generated CMB maps by sampling Gaussian draws characterized by a covariance matrix based on cosmological parameters. They mention that these maps cover an effective angular surface of approximately 34 degÂ².

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The CATS database is referenced in the paper, and I will look for the corresponding citation:

- For **CATS database**, the citation is:
  > B. Burkhart, S. Appel, S. Bialy, J. Cho, A. Christensen, D. Collins, C. Federrath, D. Fielding, D. Finkbeiner, A. Hill, et al. *The catalogue for astrophysical turbulence simulations (cats)*. The Astrophysical Journal, 905(1):14, 2020.

The CMB maps are generated based on standard cosmological models, but since they are not a specific dataset with a citation, I will note that they are simulated based on established cosmological parameters.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the CATS database and summarize the details of each dataset clearly.

In conclusion, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that all relevant information is accurately captured and cited.
