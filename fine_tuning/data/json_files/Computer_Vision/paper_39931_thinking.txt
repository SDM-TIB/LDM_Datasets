To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transforming Complex Sentences into a Semantic Hierarchy" by Christina Niklaus et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method across **three datasets from two different domains**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three specific datasets:

1. **Wikilarge**: This dataset consists of 359 sentences from the PWKP corpus, which is used for text simplification tasks.
2. **Newsela**: This dataset includes 1,077 sentences from news articles, demonstrating the method's applicability across different domains.
3. **WikiSplit**: This dataset contains 5,000 test sentences mined from Wikipedia edit histories, specifically designed for evaluating sentence splitting.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Wikilarge**, the citation is:
  > Wei Xu, Chris Callison-Burch, and Courtney Napoles. *Problems in current text simplification research: New data can help*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 3:283–297, 2015.

- For **Newsela**, the citation is:
  > Wei Xu, Courtney Napoles, Ellie Pavlick, Quanze Chen, and Chris Callison-Burch. *Optimizing statistical machine translation for text simplification*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 4:401–415, 2016.

- For **WikiSplit**, the citation is:
  > Jan A. Botha, Manaal Faruqui, John Alex, Jason Baldridge, and Dipanjan Das. *Learning to split and rephrase from Wikipedia edit history*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 732–737, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
