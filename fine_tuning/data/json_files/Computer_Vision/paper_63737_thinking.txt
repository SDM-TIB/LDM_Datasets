To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Aspect-oriented Opinion Alignment Network for Aspect-Based Sentiment Classification" by Xueyi Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide specific details about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Laptop Dataset**: This dataset consists of reviews related to laptops, with instances annotated for sentiment polarity (positive, negative, neutral). The statistics provided indicate the number of training and testing instances for each sentiment category.

2. **Restaurant Dataset**: Similar to the Laptop dataset, this dataset contains reviews focused on restaurants, also annotated for sentiment polarity. The authors provide the number of training and testing instances for each sentiment category.

3. **Twitter Dataset**: This dataset is constructed from Twitter posts and includes instances with sentiment annotations. The authors again provide statistics on the number of training and testing instances for each sentiment category.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Laptop Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Maria Pontiki, Dimitris Galanis, Haris Papageorgiou, Ion Androutsopoulos, Suresh Manandhar, Mohammed AL-Smadi, Mahmoud Al-Ayyoub, Yanyan Zhao, Bing Qin, Orphée De Clercq, et al. *SemEval-2016 Task 5: Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis*. In Proceedings of the 10th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2016), pp. 19–30. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2016.

- For the **Restaurant Dataset**, the citation is the same as the Laptop Dataset since both datasets are part of the SemEval-2016 Task 5.

- For the **Twitter Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li Dong, Furu Wei, Chuanqi Tan, Duyu Tang, Ming Zhou, and Ke Xu. *Adaptive Recursive Neural Network for Target-Dependent Twitter Sentiment Classification*. In Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers), pp. 49–54, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
