To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Learning with Multi-View Rendering for 3D Point Cloud Analysis" by Bach Tran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on various datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they mention using **ModelNet40** for pre-training, which is a synthetic dataset that includes 9,480 training samples and 2,468 test samples across 40 categories. This dataset is crucial for understanding their method's performance.

Additionally, they refer to **ScanObjectNN**, a real-world dataset with 2,321 training samples and 581 test samples, used for object classification tasks. This dataset is also significant as it provides a benchmark for evaluating the proposed method in real-world scenarios.

In the **References section**, I will look for the full citations of these datasets. The citations I need to retrieve are:

- For **ModelNet40**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Z., Song, S., Khosla, A., Yu, F., Zhang, L., Tang, X., & Xiao, J. (2015). *3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015.

- For **ScanObjectNN**, the citation is:
  > Uy, M.A., Pham, Q.H., Hua, B.S., Nguyen, D.T., & Yeung, S.K. (2019). *Revisiting Point Cloud Classification: A New Benchmark Dataset and Classification Model on Real-World Data*. In International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
