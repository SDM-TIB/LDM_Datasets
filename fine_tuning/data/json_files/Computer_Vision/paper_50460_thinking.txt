To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Orthogonal Transforms for Signals on Directed Graphs" by Julia Barrufet and Antonio Ortega, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets used in prior work or experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is where the authors typically describe the datasets they used for their experiments. If there is no specific section, I will check for any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any descriptions of the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research. If the authors mention any datasets, I will take note of their names and any details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for others to locate the datasets.

If the paper refers to well-known datasets, I will ensure to find the original papers or sources that describe these datasets to provide accurate citations. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
