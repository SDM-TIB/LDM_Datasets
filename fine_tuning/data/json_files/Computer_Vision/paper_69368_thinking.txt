To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compression of Structured Data with Autoencoders: Provable Benefit of Nonlinearities and Depth" by Kevin KÃ¶gler et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the datasets used in the experiments.

2. **Identify Sections on Experiments and Datasets**: Next, I will look for sections specifically dedicated to experiments or datasets. In this paper, I will focus on sections that discuss the experimental setup and the datasets used for validation.

3. **Locate Specific Dataset Mentions**: In the relevant sections, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets. This includes checking for names of datasets, descriptions of their characteristics, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of data).

4. **Extract Dataset Details**: For each identified dataset, I will extract key details such as:
   - Name of the dataset
   - Description of the dataset (e.g., what it contains, its purpose)
   - Any specific characteristics (e.g., size, format, type of data)

5. **Check References for Citations**: After identifying the datasets, I will consult the references section of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

6. **Document the Datasets**: I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:
   - The name of the dataset
   - A brief description
   - The full citation as found in the references section

7. **Review for Completeness**: Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure that all relevant datasets have been documented and that the citations are accurate.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I comprehensively extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, along with their proper citations.
