To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Text-Align Anomaly Backbone Model for Industrial Inspection Tasks" by Ho-Weng Lee and Shang-Hong Lai, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on multiple datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a clear description of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention several datasets:

1. **MVTecAD**: This dataset includes 5,354 images of ten industrial objects and five textures, with annotations for normal and anomaly images. 

2. **BTAD**: This dataset consists of 2,830 images across three classes, which include both normal and various types of anomaly images.

3. **KSDD2**: This dataset contains 356 defective images and 2,979 normal images, specifically developed for defective production items.

4. **MixedWM38**: This dataset includes real and synthetic patterns, comprising one normal pattern, eight basic single defect patterns, and 29 mixed defect patterns.

The authors provide a brief description of each dataset, which will help in creating a comprehensive overview.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
