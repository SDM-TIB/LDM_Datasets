To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Multimodal Dangerous State Recognition and Early Warning System for Elderly with Intermittent Dementia" by Liyun Deng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides an overview of the system developed, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **Related Work and Methodology sections**. In the Related Work section, the authors mention the creation of a small dataset containing scene images and map images. This indicates that they have collected their own data, which is crucial for my extraction.

In the **Experiments section**, the authors provide details about the dataset they collected. They mention that they gathered **2930 data sets** by having team members wear the smart helmet to simulate elderly outings. This dataset includes scene images, map images, and danger status labels, which are essential for understanding the scope of their research.

The paper specifies the classifications of the data:
- **Scene images**: Covering five common scenes for the elderly (road, stairs, riverside, woods, street) with danger levels categorized as Safe, Low Danger, Medium Danger, and High Danger.
- **Map images**: Also classified into the same danger levels.
- **Danger status labels**: Indicating the current danger level of the elderly during outings.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, since the authors created their own dataset, I will note that the dataset does not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:
1. **Elderly Behavior Dataset**: A dataset created by the authors containing 2930 data sets, including scene images, map images, and danger status labels. The dataset is not publicly available and is specific to their research.

Since this dataset is unique to the study and does not have a formal citation, I will note that in my final output.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
