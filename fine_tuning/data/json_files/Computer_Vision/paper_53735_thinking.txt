To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data-Driven Learning of Safety-Critical Control with Stochastic Control Barrier Functions" by Chuanzheng Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often highlights key datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Experiments," "Methodology," or "Data Collection."** In this paper, the authors describe their approach to data collection in **Algorithm 1**, which outlines how they sample data points and construct a dataset for training their neural network.

In the methodology section, the authors mention that they sample a set of initial points and perform transitions to collect data. They specifically state that they create a dataset \( D \) consisting of pairs \( \{x_i, \tilde{\Delta}(x_i)\} \), where \( x_i \) are the sampled points and \( \tilde{\Delta}(x_i) \) is the estimated value derived from their calculations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets used. However, it appears that the paper does not reference any external datasets but rather describes a dataset generated through their own sampling process.

Since the dataset is constructed from the authors' own experiments, I will summarize it as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Custom Dataset for Stochastic Control Barrier Functions
   - **Description**: This dataset consists of sampled points from a stochastic dynamical system, where each point \( x_i \) is paired with an estimated value \( \tilde{\Delta}(x_i) \) derived from the system's dynamics. The dataset is used to train a neural network for approximating the derivative of the stochastic control barrier function.
   - **Citation**: This dataset does not have a formal citation as it is generated by the authors through their experimental methodology.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the relevant datasets and their details as presented in the paper.
