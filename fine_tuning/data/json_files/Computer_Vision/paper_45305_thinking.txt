To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Collaborative Training of GANs in Continuous and Discrete Spaces for Text Generation" by Yanghoon Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the experimental results are based on "three standard benchmark datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In the paper, the authors mention evaluating their model on three datasets: 

1. **COCO Image Caption dataset**: This dataset is used for generating captions for images and is known for its diverse set of images and corresponding captions.

2. **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus**: This dataset is designed for natural language inference tasks and contains a large number of sentence pairs with labels indicating entailment, contradiction, or neutrality.

3. **EMNLP 2017 WMT News dataset**: This dataset is used for machine translation tasks and consists of news articles, providing a rich source of text for evaluation.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **COCO Image Caption dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xinlei Chen, Hao Fang, Tsung-Yi Lin, Ramakrishna Vedantam, Saurabh Gupta, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO Captions: Data Collection and Evaluation Server*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.00325, 2015.

- For the **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus**, the citation is:
  > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A Large Annotated Corpus for Learning Natural Language Inference*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 632–642, 2015.

- For the **EMNLP 2017 WMT News dataset**, the citation is:
  > Diederik P. Kingma and Jimmy Ba. *Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1412.6980, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
