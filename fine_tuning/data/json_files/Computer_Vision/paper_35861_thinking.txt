To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Conditioning of three-dimensional generative adversarial networks for pore and reservoir-scale models" by Lukas J. Mosser et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their method on two types of datasets: **three-dimensional micro-CT images of a Ketton limestone** and **the Maules Creek alluvial aquifer**. This suggests that both datasets are relevant for extraction.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **results section**. The authors describe the **Ketton limestone dataset** as a gray-scale micro-CT image used for model conditioning, while the **Maules Creek dataset** is mentioned as a three-dimensional reservoir dataset used for training the GANs. 

In the **conclusions section**, the authors reiterate the use of these datasets for their experiments, confirming their significance in the study.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Ketton limestone dataset**, the citation is:
  > Menke, H., Bijeljic, B., and Blunt, M. (2017). Dynamic reservoir-condition microtomography of reactive transport in complex carbonates: Effect of initial pore structure and initial brine pH. *Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta*, 204, 267â€“285.

- For the **Maules Creek dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mariethoz, G. and Caers, J. (2014). Multiple-point geostatistics: stochastic modeling with training images. *John Wiley & Sons*.

With these citations, I can now summarize the datasets:

1. **Ketton limestone dataset**: A gray-scale micro-CT image used for conditioning in the study.
2. **Maules Creek dataset**: A three-dimensional reservoir dataset utilized for training the GANs.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
