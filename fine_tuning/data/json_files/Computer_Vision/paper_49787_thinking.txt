To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Automated Approach for the Recognition of Bengali License Plates" by Md Abdullah Al Nasim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of a hybrid method for detecting license plates and mentions that the authors used their own dataset comprising more than 37,700 images. This indicates that a dataset is present, but I need to gather more details.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** where the authors describe their data collection process. They mention that the dataset was created from images captured using a mobile camera, specifically focusing on the front or back of vehicles. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, but I need to confirm if there are any other datasets referenced.

In the **experiments section**, the authors discuss the performance of their model and the dataset's role in training and testing. They specify that the dataset was divided into training, validation, and testing sets, but they do not provide any additional datasets used in their research.

Since the authors primarily used their own dataset, I will focus on documenting this dataset in detail. I will note the following key points:
- The dataset consists of over 37,700 images.
- It is specifically designed for Bengali license plate recognition.
- The dataset was annotated for training the YOLO model and the CNN model.

Now, I will look into the **references section** to check if there are any citations related to publicly available datasets that might have been used in conjunction with their own dataset. However, the references primarily cite other research papers and do not mention any external datasets.

Since the authors did not reference any external datasets, I will only document their own dataset. The full citation for the dataset will be based on the paper itself:

- For the dataset used in this research, the citation is:
  > Md Abdullah Al Nasim, Atiqul Islam Chowdhury, Jannatun Naeem Muna, and Faisal Muhammad Shah. *An Automated Approach for the Recognition of Bengali License Plates*. In Proceedings of the 2021 International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Information Technology (ICECIT), pages 1-6, 2021.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
