To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Movie101v2: Improved Movie Narration Benchmark" by Zihao Yue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the development of a large-scale, bilingual movie narration dataset called **Movie101v2**, which indicates that this is a primary dataset of interest. The introduction further elaborates on the limitations of existing datasets and emphasizes the importance of benchmark datasets for movie understanding and narration.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (Data: Movie101v2)**, which is dedicated to the dataset itself. This section provides detailed information about the construction, scaling, and quality enhancement of the **Movie101v2** dataset. It states that the dataset consists of 203 movies and 46K bilingual video-narration pairs, which is crucial information for describing the dataset.

In this section, I will also note the improvements made over the original **Movie101** dataset, which included only 101 movies and 14K video-narration pairs. The authors highlight the enhancements in data scale and quality, which are significant for understanding the dataset's contributions to the field.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the original **Movie101** dataset, as it is relevant to the new dataset. The citation for **Movie101** is:
> Zihao Yue, Qi Zhang, Anwen Hu, Liang Zhang, Ziheng Wang, and Qin Jin. *Movie101: A New Movie Understanding Benchmark*. In Proceedings of the 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 4669â€“4684, 2023. https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2023.acl-long.257

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for **Movie101v2** as well. The citation for **Movie101v2** is:
> Zihao Yue, Yepeng Zhang, Ziheng Wang, and Qin Jin. *Movie101v2: Improved Movie Narration Benchmark*. Preprint.

Finally, I will summarize the findings for each dataset, ensuring that I include the necessary details such as the number of movies, the number of video-narration pairs, and any unique features that distinguish it from other datasets.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare to present the dataset entries in a clear and organized manner, ready for further processing or review.
