To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Early Neuron Alignment in Two-layer ReLU Networks with Small Initialization" by Hancheng Min, Enrique Mallada, and Ren√© Vidal, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that "Numerical experiments on the MNIST dataset illustrate our theoretical findings," which indicates that the MNIST dataset is used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** for any additional datasets. In the introduction, the authors mention that they are studying a binary classification problem and refer to a training dataset with well-separated input vectors. However, they do not specify any datasets other than MNIST.

In the **experiments section**, they describe their numerical experiments using the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digits. They mention preprocessing the training data by centering it, but they do not introduce any new datasets.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset, and its citation is typically:

- Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the only dataset extracted from this paper is the MNIST dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for the MNIST dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.
