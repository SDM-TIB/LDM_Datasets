To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Interactive Region Segmentation and Captioning" by Ali Sharifi Boroujerdi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses a novel hybrid deep learning architecture for interactive region segmentation and captioning, but it does not specify any datasets yet. The introduction may provide more context or mention specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, the authors mention using the **PASCAL VOC 2012 segmentation dataset** for fine-tuning their model. They describe this dataset as including 1464 images for training and 1449 images for validation, distributed across 20 different classes. This is a clear indication of a dataset that I need to document.

Additionally, the authors mention using several well-known segmentation benchmarks for validation, including:

1. **Alpha Matting Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of evaluating segmentation methods.
2. **Berkeley Segmentation Dataset (BSDS500)**: Another dataset mentioned for comparison purposes.
3. **Weizmann Segmentation Evaluation Database**: Also referenced as part of their evaluation.
4. **Image Object Segmentation Visual Quality Evaluation Database**: Mentioned in the context of their experiments.
5. **VOC Validation Subset**: This is a subset of the PASCAL VOC dataset used for validation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each of these datasets:

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
