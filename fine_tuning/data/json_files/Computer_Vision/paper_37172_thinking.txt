To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretability in Linear Brain Decoding" by Seyed Mostafa Kia and Andrea Passerini, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information accurately, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, while the introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research. I will look for any mentions of datasets or data sources used in the experiments.

Next, I will carefully review the **methods** section, particularly any subsections that discuss experimental materials or datasets. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant preprocessing steps. I will take note of any specific dataset names mentioned.

In the **results** section, I will check for any additional references to datasets, especially if the authors discuss the outcomes of their experiments in relation to specific datasets. This may provide further confirmation of the datasets used and their relevance to the study's findings.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to locate the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper attribution is necessary for academic integrity. I will ensure that I capture all relevant details, such as authors, titles, publication venues, and years.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Haufe et al. (2013) dataset," I will look up the full citation for that dataset in the references section to include it in my extraction.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my step-by-step approach will involve:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Analyzing the methods section for detailed descriptions of datasets.
3. Reviewing the results section for any additional dataset references.
4. Consulting the references section for full citations of each dataset.
5. Compiling the extracted information into a clear and organized format.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
