To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analytic Pricing of SOFR Futures Contracts with Smile and Skew" by Colin Turfus and Aurelio Romero-Berm√∫dez, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can hint at the data used for analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **results and discussion sections**. These sections often contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments or analyses. I will look for any specific datasets that are referenced, including their names and any relevant details about their structure or content.

I will also check the **calibration and experiments sections** for any mention of datasets used for calibration or testing the models. This is crucial as it often reveals the datasets that are integral to the research findings.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will pay close attention to it, as it will likely provide explicit names and descriptions of the datasets used in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "SOFR futures data," I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail. If the dataset is derived from another study, I will cite that original study.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.

Finally, I will ensure that the citations are formatted correctly and are complete, including authors, title, publication venue, and year, to maintain academic integrity and facilitate further research.
