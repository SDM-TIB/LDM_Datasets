To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding the network formation pattern for better link prediction" by Jiating Yu and Ling-Yun Wu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on various simulated and real-world networks, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics. The authors discuss several datasets, including:

1. **Online Social Network Dataset**: This dataset is derived from private messages sent on a Facebook-like platform at the University of California. It is mentioned that the dataset can be downloaded from a specific URL.

2. **European Email Network**: This dataset consists of email communications over an 18-month period at a large European research institution. The authors provide a link to download this dataset as well.

3. **Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) Dataset**: The authors refer to this dataset as part of the Open Graph Benchmark competition, providing a link for access.

4. **Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Dataset**: The authors mention three snapshots of the S. cerevisiae PPI networks, which can be downloaded from the BioGRID database.

5. **MOOC Online Course Dataset**: This dataset consists of user interactions with online courses and is referenced with a citation to the authors who compiled it.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accurately referenced in future work. 

The citations I will extract include:

- For the **Online Social Network Dataset**:

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and citations, into a structured format for easy reference and use in future analyses or applications.
