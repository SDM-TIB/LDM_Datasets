To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PeQuENet: Perceptual Quality Enhancement of Compressed Video with Adaptation- and Attention-based Network" by Saiping Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method and its evaluation, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (Section IV), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, the authors mention that they employed **108 sequences representing various content types and resolutions** for training, which is a clear indication of a dataset being used.

I will look for specific details about the dataset, such as its name, the number of sequences, and any relevant characteristics. The authors state that all sequences were compressed by H.265/HEVC reference software HM16.5 under Low Delay P (LDP) configuration with quantization parameters (QPs) set to 22, 27, 32, and 37. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

Additionally, I will check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to standard test sequences or datasets, I will ensure to extract their full citations.

From the information gathered, I will compile the dataset details, including the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that I adhere to the importance of providing complete references for each dataset.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
