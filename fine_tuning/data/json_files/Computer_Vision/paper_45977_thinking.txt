To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Facetwise Mesh Refinement for Multi-View Stereo" by Andrea Romanoni and Matteo Matteucci, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by scanning the **abstract and introduction** sections for any mention of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments in section VI, where they mention applying their pipeline to the **DTU dataset**. This indicates that the DTU dataset is a key dataset used in their evaluation.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the DTU dataset. The paper mentions that they used the same sequences from the DTU dataset as in previous works, which suggests that the dataset is well-established in the field.

Upon reviewing the references, I find the citation for the DTU dataset:
- **DTU Dataset**: 
  > R. Jensen, A. Dahl, G. Vogiatzis, E. Tola, and H. Aanæs. *Large scale multi-view stereopsis evaluation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2014, pp. 406–413.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, particularly in the context of comparisons or evaluations. The authors also reference other datasets in their experiments, such as the **EPFL dataset**. I will locate its citation in the references as well.

The citation for the EPFL dataset is:
- **EPFL Dataset**:
  > C. Strecha, W. von Hansen, L. Van Gool, P. Fua, and U. Thoennessen. *On benchmarking camera calibration and multi-view stereo for high resolution imagery*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2008, pp. 1–8.

After gathering all relevant datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations, which is crucial for proper attribution and further research.
