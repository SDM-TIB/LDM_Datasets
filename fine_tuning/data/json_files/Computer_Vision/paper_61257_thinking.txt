To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Full Resolution Repetition Counting" by Jianing Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors demonstrate their method on three public datasets: **TransRAC, UCFRep, and QUVA**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for understanding the experiments conducted.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention:

1. **RepCount Dataset**: This dataset is highlighted as providing fine-grained annotations, including the start and end of actions. It consists of 758 training videos, 132 validation videos, and 151 testing videos, covering a wide range of video lengths and containing challenging cases.

2. **QUVA Dataset**: This dataset comprises 100 testing videos with an average of 12.5 action cycles per video. It includes realistic scenarios with occlusions and variations in action cycles.

3. **UCFRep Dataset**: This dataset contains 526 repetitive action videos collected from the UCF101 dataset, which is known for its action recognition tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **RepCount Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dwibedi, D., Aytar, Y., Tompson, J., Sermanet, P., Zisserman, A. (2020). *Counting out time: Class agnostic video repetition counting in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 10387–10396.

- For the **QUVA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hu, H., Dong, S., Zhao, Y., Lian, D., Li, Z., Gao, S. (2020). *TransRAC: Encoding multi-scale temporal correlation with transformers for repetitive action counting*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 19013–19022.

- For the **UCFRep Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, H., Xu, X., Han, G., He, S. (2020). *Context-aware and scale-insensitive temporal repetition counting*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 670–678.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
