To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Off-Policy Evaluation for Large Action Spaces via Policy Convolution" by Lequn Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on both synthetic and benchmark datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of off-policy evaluation in various applications, hinting at the use of specific datasets for empirical validation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup in section 4.1, where they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset is generated to simulate a contextual bandit setup, where contexts are sampled from a normal distribution, and actions are assigned to latent topics. The authors provide details about how the dataset is structured and the underlying reward function.

2. **Movielens-100k Dataset**: This is a well-known dataset used in recommender systems, consisting of user-item-rating tuples. The authors describe how they converted this dataset into a bandit feedback format for their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Synthetic Dataset**, since it is generated by the authors, there may not be a formal citation, but I will note the methodology used to create it.
  
- For the **Movielens-100k Dataset**, the citation is:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The Movielens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS), 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
