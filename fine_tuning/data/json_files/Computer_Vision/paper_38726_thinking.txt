To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Relativistic f-Divergences" by Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 5) closely, as this section typically details the datasets used in the study. In this paper, the author mentions using **CIFAR-10**, **CelebA**, and **CAT** datasets for training and evaluation. I will note down the specific details provided about each dataset, such as their characteristics and any relevant statistics mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. 

For the datasets mentioned in this paper, I will compile the following citations:

1. **CIFAR-10**:
   > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. [Link to dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

2. **CelebA**:
   > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV). [Link to dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html).

3. **CAT**:
   > Zhang, W., Sun, J., & Tang, X. (2008). *Cat head detectionâ€”how to effectively exploit shape and texture features*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV). [Link to dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/cat/).

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will facilitate easy access and understanding for anyone reviewing the paper or interested in the datasets used in the research.
