To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fusion-Aware Point Convolution for Online Semantic 3D Scene Segmentation" by Jiazhao Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on public benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Benchmarks)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that they evaluate their method on two datasets: **ScanNet** and **SceneNN**. I will take note of the details provided about each dataset.

1. **ScanNet**: The authors mention that ScanNet contains 1513 scanned scene sequences, with 1200 sequences used for training and 312 for testing. This dataset is well-known in the field of 3D scene understanding.

2. **SceneNN**: This dataset consists of 50 high-quality scanned scene sequences with semantic labels. However, the authors note that it is not specifically organized for online segmentation tasks, and they filtered it down to 15 clean sequences for their evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ScanNet**, the citation is:
  > Angela Dai, Angel X Chang, Manolis Savva, Maciej Halber, Thomas Funkhouser, and Matthias Nießner. *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 5828–5839, 2017.

- For **SceneNN**, the citation is:
  > Binh-Son Hua, Quang-Hieu Pham, Duc Thanh Nguyen, Minh-Khoi Tran, Lap-Fai Yu, and Sai-Kit Yeung. *SceneNN: A Scene Meshes Dataset with Annotations*. In International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV), 2016.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
