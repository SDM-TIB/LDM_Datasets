To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RLAD: Reinforcement Learning from Pixels for Autonomous Driving in Urban Environments" by Daniel Coelho, Miguel Oliveira, and Vítor Santos, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the experimental results show RLAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the **NoCrash benchmark**, which indicates that this benchmark is likely a dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their evaluation setup and mention that they are using the **NoCrash benchmark** for their experiments. This benchmark is crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed method.

I will then check the **related work section** to see if there are any references to datasets that have been used in previous studies, particularly those that might be relevant to the NoCrash benchmark. The authors reference the NoCrash benchmark multiple times, indicating its significance in their work.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the NoCrash benchmark. The paper cites the benchmark as follows:
- For the **NoCrash benchmark**, the citation is:
  > F. Codevilla, E. Santana, A. M. López, and A. Gaidon. *Exploring the limitations of behavior cloning for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 9328–9337, 2019.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the primary dataset used in this research is the **NoCrash benchmark**.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation for the NoCrash benchmark as required. This will provide a clear and concise summary of the dataset used in the research paper.
