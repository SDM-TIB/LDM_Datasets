To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparison of the Deep-Learning-Based Automated Segmentation Methods for the Head Sectioned Images of the Virtual Korean Human Project" by Mohammad Eshghi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides an overview of the study but does not explicitly mention datasets. However, the introduction discusses the importance of large annotated training sets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology. In this section, they mention using the **Visible Korean Human (VKH) dataset** for their experiments. This dataset is crucial for understanding the context of their research.

In the experiments section, the authors provide details about the VKH dataset, stating that it consists of sectioned images of the head from a male cadaver, created by Prof. Min Suk Chung. They describe the imaging process and the manual segmentation performed on the dataset, which includes labeling eight anatomical regions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the VKH dataset. The paper references the VKH project, and I will look for the appropriate citation format. The relevant citation is:

> "Overview of the Visible Korean Project." Available at: http://vkh3.kisti.re.kr/?q=node/24.

Since this is a web resource, I will ensure to note it as the citation for the VKH dataset.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, including its name, description, and citation, ensuring that the citation is complete and properly formatted.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and reference.
