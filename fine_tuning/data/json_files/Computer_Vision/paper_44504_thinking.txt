To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Emergence of Adversarial Communication in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning" by Jan Blumenkamp and Amanda Prorok, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on multi-agent coverage and path planning problems. I will look for specific datasets or environments that were utilized in these experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors describe three tasks: 
1. **Coverage in non-convex environments**
2. **Coverage in split environments**
3. **Path planning**

However, the paper does not explicitly name any publicly available datasets. Instead, it describes custom grid-world environments created for the experiments. Therefore, I will note that these environments are not standard datasets but rather custom setups designed for the study.

Since there are no formal datasets with citations provided in the references, I will summarize the custom environments as follows:

1. **Custom Grid-World Environment for Coverage in Non-Convex Environments**: This environment is designed for agents to cover all free cells while avoiding obstacles. It is a simulated environment with specific parameters set by the authors.

2. **Custom Grid-World Environment for Coverage in Split Environments**: Similar to the first, this environment requires agents to cover only one half of the space, emphasizing coordination among agents.

3. **Custom Grid-World Environment for Path Planning**: This environment involves agents navigating to designated goals while avoiding collisions, requiring communication and coordination.

Since these environments are not standard datasets, I will not provide formal citations as they do not exist in the typical sense. Instead, I will note that the authors have made their code publicly available, which may include the environments used for the experiments.

Now, I will compile the information about the custom environments into a structured format for clarity, ensuring to highlight that these are not traditional datasets with citations but rather experimental setups created for the research.
