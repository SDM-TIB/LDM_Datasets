To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling Caption Diversity in Contrastive Vision-Language Pretraining" by Samuel Lavoie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the importance of large-scale datasets for training models like CLIP. They reference the **MetaCLIP dataset**, which is crucial for their experiments. This indicates that I should look for more details about this dataset in the subsequent sections.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors explicitly mention that they trained their models on the **Common Crawl data** curated using the methodology presented in Xu et al. (2023). They also state that they used a dataset of **2.5 billion image-text pairs** collected with specific parameters. This is a significant dataset that needs to be documented.

Additionally, I will check the **results section** for any other datasets mentioned in the context of evaluation benchmarks. The authors refer to standard benchmarks like **ImageNet**, **Flickr30k**, and **MSCOCO** for zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks. These datasets are widely recognized and should be included in the extraction.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **MetaCLIP Dataset**:
   - Citation: Xu, H., Xie, S., Tan, X. E., Huang, P.-Y., Howes, R., Sharma, V., Li, S.-W., Ghosh, G., Zettlemoyer, L., and Feichtenhofer, C. *Demystifying CLIP Data*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.12345, 2023.

2. **Common Crawl Dataset**:
   - Citation: Common Crawl. *Common Crawl: A repository of web crawl data*. Available at: https://commoncrawl.org/.

3. **ImageNet**:
   - Citation: Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., Zhou, K., Yang, J., Loy, C. C., and Fei-Fei, L. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211–252, 2015.

4. **Flickr30k**:
   - Citation: Young, P., Lai, A., Hodosh, M., and Hockenmaier, J. *From image descriptions to visual denotations: New similarity metrics for semantic inference over event descriptions*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2:67–78, 2014.

5. **MSCOCO**:
   - Citation: Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., and Zitnick, C. L. *Microsoft coco: Common objects in context*. In Computer Vision – ECCV 2014, pp. 740–755, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
