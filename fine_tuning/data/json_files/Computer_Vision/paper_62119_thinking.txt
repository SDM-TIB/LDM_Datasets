To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Group Orthogonalization Regularization for Vision Models Adaptation and Robustness" by Yoav Kurtz, Noga Bar, and Raja Giryes, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments conducted, and I will look for any specific dataset names or references.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the effectiveness of their proposed method and mention using it on various tasks, which may imply the use of specific datasets. I will pay close attention to any datasets explicitly named or referenced.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail their experimental setup. This section is likely to contain the most relevant information regarding the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup."

Upon reviewing the experiments, I find that the authors mention three datasets used for fine-tuning their models:

1. **CIFAR-100**: This dataset contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, categorized into 100 classes. It is a well-known benchmark for image classification tasks.

2. **Street View House Numbers (SVHN)**: This dataset consists of over 600,000 labeled images, with 73,257 training samples and 26,032 testing samples. It is commonly used for digit classification tasks.

3. **Food-101**: This dataset includes 101 food categories, with a total of 101,000 images, where each category has 750 training and 250 testing samples.

Additionally, in the section discussing the adaptation of diffusion models, the authors mention three more datasets:

4. **Oxford 102 Flower Dataset**: This dataset consists of 102 flower categories, with each class containing between 40 and 258 images.

5. **Pokemon-BLIP**: This dataset includes 833 text-image pairs, where each pair consists of a Pokemon image and a corresponding caption generated by the BLIP model.

6. **FS-COCO**: This dataset comprises 10,000 freehand scene vector sketches, each augmented with a text description.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

The citations I find are as follows:

With all this information gathered, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.
