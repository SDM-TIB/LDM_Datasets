To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DiffusionDepth: Diffusion Denoising Approach for Monocular Depth Estimation" by Yiqun Duan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that their experimental results are based on the **KITTI** and **NYU-Depth-V2** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: This dataset is described as being captured from outdoor driving scenarios, with a depth range of 0-100m and sparse ground truth (GT) depth values (density between 3.75% and 5%). The authors provide specific details about the number of training and testing images, which is essential for understanding the dataset's scope.

2. **NYU-Depth-V2 Dataset**: This dataset is noted for being collected from indoor scenes with dense GT depth values (density > 95%). The authors also mention the number of training and testing images, which helps to contextualize its use in their experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **KITTI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, Christoph Stiller, and Raquel Urtasun. *Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, 32(11):1231–1237, 2013.

- For the **NYU-Depth-V2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nathan Silberman, Derek Hoiem, Pushmeet Kohli, and Rob Fergus. *Indoor segmentation and support inference from RGBD images*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 746–760. Springer, 2012.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets along with their full citations, which is crucial for any subsequent referencing or validation of the research findings.
