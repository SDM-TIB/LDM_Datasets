To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heterogeneous Graph Masked Autoencoders" by Yijun Tian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will look for any specific dataset names, descriptions, and the context in which they were used.

In this paper, the authors mention four datasets used for evaluation: **DBLP, Freebase, ACM, and AMiner**. I will note down the details provided for each dataset, including any relevant statistics or characteristics mentioned in the text.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

The citations I will look for are:

1. **DBLP**: I will find the original source or paper that describes the DBLP dataset.
2. **Freebase**: Similarly, I will locate the citation for the Freebase dataset.
3. **ACM**: I will identify the reference for the ACM dataset.
4. **AMiner**: Lastly, I will find the citation for the AMiner dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ready for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant details while maintaining the integrity of the citations.
