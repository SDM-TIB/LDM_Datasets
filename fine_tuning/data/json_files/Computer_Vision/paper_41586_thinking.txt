To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving VAE generations of multimodal data through data-dependent conditional priors" by Frantzeska Lavda et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and empirical evaluation sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction may mention datasets used for validation or comparison, so I will pay close attention to any claims regarding experimental results.

Next, I will focus on the **empirical evaluation section** (Section 5), where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention using two real-image datasets: **MNIST** and **Omniglot**. I will extract details about these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

For each dataset, I will look for specific information such as:
- The purpose of the dataset in the context of the research.
- Any modifications made to the dataset (e.g., binarization).
- The splits used for training, validation, and testing.

After gathering this information, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary details to access the datasets.

The citations I will look for are:
- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann Lecun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE, pages 2278–2324, 1998.

- For **Omniglot**, the citation is:
  > Brenden M. Lake, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, and Joshua B. Tenenbaum. *Human-level concept learning through probabilistic program induction*. Science, 350(6266), 1332–1338, 2015.

Once I have the necessary details and citations, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that highlights the key aspects of each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
