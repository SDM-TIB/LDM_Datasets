To extract datasets from the research paper titled "S3A: Towards Realistic Zero-Shot Classification via Self Structural Semantic Alignment" by Sheng Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their method on various benchmarks, which is a strong indicator that datasets are involved.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for a subsection specifically dedicated to datasets or benchmarks. Here, the authors provide a profile of the datasets used for evaluation, including details such as the number of training and testing samples, the number of categories, and any relevant characteristics of the datasets.

From the text, I identify the following datasets:

1. **Stanford Dogs Dataset**: This dataset contains 12,000 training images and 8,000 testing images, with a total of 120 categories.

2. **ImageNet-100**: This dataset consists of 127,000 training images and 5,000 testing images, with 100 categories.

3. **ImageNet-1K**: This dataset has 1 million training images and 50,000 testing images, covering 1,000 categories.

4. **Living17 Dataset**: This dataset includes 88,000 training images and 3,000 testing images, with 68 categories.

5. **Nonliving26 Dataset**: This dataset has 132,000 training images and 5,000 testing images, with 104 categories.

6. **Entity13 Dataset**: This dataset contains 334,000 training images and 13,000 testing images, with 260 categories.

7. **Entity30 Dataset**: This dataset includes 307,000 training images and 12,000 testing images, with 240 categories.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations may not always be provided directly in the paper, but I will look for any references that discuss the datasets or their original sources.

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations based on the information provided in the paper and any relevant references:

- **Stanford Dogs Dataset**:

  > Santurkar, S., Tsipras, D., & Madry, A. (2020). BREEDS: Benchmarks for subpopulation shift. arXiv preprint arXiv:2008.04859.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the specified requirements for downstream processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its respective citation for future reference.
