To extract datasets from the research paper titled "From NeRFLiX to NeRFLiX++: A General NeRF-Agnostic Restorer Paradigm" by Kun Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed large-scale training data, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly section 6, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. They mention conducting experiments on three popular datasets: **LLFF**, **Tanks and Temples**, and **Noisy LLFF Synthetic**. I will note down the details provided for each dataset.

1. **LLFF Dataset**: The authors mention that this dataset consists of eight different forward-facing scenes with 20-62 high-quality input views. They also reference the original paper for this dataset.

2. **Tanks and Temples Dataset**: This dataset is noted for benchmarking large-scale scene reconstruction and is referenced in the context of the experiments conducted.

3. **Noisy LLFF Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset is described as having eight virtual scenes where camera jetting is manually applied to simulate imperfect calibration.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution.

- For the **LLFF Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P. Srinivasan, Rodrigo Ortiz-Cayon, Nima Khademi Kalantari, Ravi Ramamoorthi, Ren Ng, and Abhishek Kar. *Local light field fusion: Practical view synthesis with prescriptive sampling guidelines*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 38(4):1–14, 2019.

- For the **Tanks and Temples Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Arno Knapitsch, Jaesik Park, Qian-Yi Zhou, and Vladlen Koltun. *Tanks and temples: Benchmarking large-scale scene reconstruction*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (ToG), 36(4):1–13, 2017.

- For the **Noisy LLFF Synthetic Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P. Srinivasan, Matthew Tancik, Jonathan T. Barron, Ravi Ramamoorthi, and Ren Ng. *Nerf: Representing scenes as neural radiance fields for view synthesis*. In ECCV, 2020.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
