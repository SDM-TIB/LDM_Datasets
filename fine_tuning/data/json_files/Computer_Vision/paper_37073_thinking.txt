To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comprehensive Evaluation of OpenCL-based Convolutional Neural Network Accelerators in Xilinx and Altera FPGAs" by R. Tapiador et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, but I will need to delve deeper into the introduction and methodology for specific dataset references.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the advancements in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their applications, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets. I will continue to the **methodology** section, where the authors describe their experimental setup.

In **section III (Scenario 1: Altera OpenCL)**, the authors mention the use of the **MNIST database** for handwritten digit recognition. This is a well-known dataset, and I will need to gather its details.

Next, I will look for the **full citation** of the MNIST dataset in the **References section**. The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

Additionally, I will check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. In **section V (LeNet-5 and MNIST Scenario)**, the authors elaborate on the LeNet-5 architecture applied to the MNIST dataset, confirming its use in their experiments.

After reviewing the entire paper, I find that the MNIST dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned. I will now compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation is included.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MNIST dataset, ensuring that it is ready for downstream processing or review.
