To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretable Fusion Analytics Framework for fMRI Connectivity: Self–Attention Mechanism and Latent Space Item–Response Model" by Jeong-Jae Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study utilizes data from the **Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)**, which is a significant clue that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look into the **methods section**, particularly the **fMRI Data** subsection, where the authors describe the use of resting-state fMRI data collected from various cognitive impairment groups. They specify that the data comes from the ADNI dataset, which is crucial for my extraction.

In the **MRI Acquisition** section, the authors provide details about the participants and the MRI scanning protocols, confirming the dataset's relevance and the specific cohorts involved. This reinforces the importance of the ADNI dataset in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ADNI dataset. The authors reference the ADNI in multiple places, and I will ensure to capture the correct citation format.

The citation for the ADNI dataset is:
> Clifford R. Jack Jr, Matt A. Bernstein, Nick C. Fox, Paul Thompson, Gene Alexander, Danielle Harvey, Bret Borowski, Paula J. Britson, Jennifer L. Whitwell, Chadwick Ward, et al. *The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI): MRI Methods*. Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, 27(4):685–691, 2008.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the ADNI dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
