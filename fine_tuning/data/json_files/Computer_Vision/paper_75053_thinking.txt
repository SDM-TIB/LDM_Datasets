To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DADEE: Well-calibrated uncertainty quantification in neural networks for barriers-based robot safety" by Masoud Ataei and Vikas Dhiman, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to delve deeper into the other sections for specific dataset information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for accurate uncertainty quantification in robotic systems, but they do not mention specific datasets yet. I will continue to the **methodology** section, where they describe their experiments and the algorithms used.

In the **experiments section**, particularly in **Section IV**, the authors detail a **1-D regression experiment** and a **robot simulation**. They mention using a synthetic dataset generated from a function \( f(x) = x^{3/5} - x + \epsilon \), where \( \epsilon \) is uniformly distributed noise. This indicates that they created their own dataset for the regression task, but I need to confirm if they provide any references or citations for this dataset.

Next, I will check the **robot simulation** part of the experiments. The authors mention using a simulation environment adapted from a previous work, specifically referencing a source for the simulation setup. This is crucial as it may lead to a dataset or a framework that can be cited.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or simulation environments mentioned. The authors reference several works, including:

1. For the **robot simulation environment**, they refer to:
   > R. Bansal, S. Tuli, R. Paul, and Mausam. "Toolnet: Using common-sense generalization for predicting tool use for robot plan synthesis." arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.05478, 2020.

2. The **synthetic dataset** does not have a formal citation since it is generated by the authors for their specific experiments. However, I will note its description for completeness.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for any referenced works and a description of the synthetic dataset used in the experiments.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
