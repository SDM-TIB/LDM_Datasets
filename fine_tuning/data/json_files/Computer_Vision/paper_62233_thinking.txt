To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Solving Dialogue Grounding Embodied Task in a Simulated Environment using Further Masked Language Modeling" by Weijie Jack Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the research involves a "collaborative building assignment taken from the Minecraft dataset," which suggests that there is a specific dataset being utilized.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any additional context or details about the dataset. The introduction references previous studies in Minecraft collaborative building tasks, specifically mentioning the Minecraft Corpus dataset introduced by Narayan-Chen et al. (2019). This is a strong indication that this dataset is relevant to the research.

In the **method section**, the author states that they use "the collaborative building datasets (Jayannavar et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2022a)." This confirms that there are multiple datasets involved in the research. I will need to gather full citations for each of these datasets.

Now, I will look into the **references section** to find the complete citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Minecraft Corpus Dataset**:
   - Citation: 
     > Anjali Narayan-Chen, Prashant Jayannavar, and Julia Hockenmaier. *Collaborative dialogue in Minecraft*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2019.

2. **Collaborative Building Dataset** (Jayannavar et al.):
   - Citation:
     > Prashant Jayannavar, Anjali Narayan-Chen, and Julia Hockenmaier. *Learning to execute instructions in a Minecraft dialogue*. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2020.

3. **LearnToAsk Model Dataset** (Shi et al.):
   - Citation:
     > Zhengxiang Shi, Yue Feng, and Aldo Lipani. *Learning to execute actions or ask clarification questions*. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: NAACL 2022, pages 2060â€“2070, Seattle, United States, 2022.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and attributed. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
