To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The field theoretical ABC of epidemic dynamics" by Giacomo Cacciapaglia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the impact of infectious diseases and the need for mathematical models, but does not specify any datasets. The introduction may provide historical context or mention specific datasets used in the analysis.

Next, I will look through the **methods and results sections** of the paper. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for analysis. I will pay close attention to any tables, figures, or references to datasets that may be included in these sections.

I will also check the **results section** for any specific mentions of datasets used in the experiments or analyses. If the authors refer to datasets by name or provide descriptions of the data, I will note these down.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University," I will ensure to include the full citation, which typically includes the authors (if applicable), title, source, and access date.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, maintaining the integrity of the information and providing proper citations for future reference.
