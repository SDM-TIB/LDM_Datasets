To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can SAM recognize crops? Quantifying the zero-shot performance of a semantic segmentation foundation model on generating crop-type maps using satellite imagery for precision agriculture" by Rutuja Gurav et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of Meta AI’s Segment Anything Model (SAM) for crop-map prediction, which suggests that datasets related to crop mapping and satellite imagery may be involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Background)**, where the authors introduce key datasets. Here, they mention the **Cropland Data Layer (CDL)**, which is a significant dataset for high-quality crop-type maps. The CDL is produced by the USDA and is described as an annual data product created at the end of the growing season, providing pixel-level classification across various crop types in the U.S.

In the same section, the authors also refer to the **CalCrop21 dataset**, which contains Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and corresponding crop labels. This dataset is crucial for their analysis and is explicitly stated to consist of 367 tiles representing agricultural fields in California.

I will then check the **References section** to gather full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Cropland Data Layer (CDL)**, the citation is:
   > Claire Boryan, Zhengwei Yang, Rick Mueller, and Mike Craig. *Monitoring US agriculture: The US Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Statistics Service, Cropland Data Layer Program*. Geocarto International, 26(5):341–358, 2011.

2. For the **CalCrop21 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Rahul Ghosh, Praveen Ravirathinam, Xiaowei Jia, Ankush Khandelwal, David Mulla, and Vipin Kumar. *CalCrop21: A georeferenced multi-spectral dataset of satellite imagery and crop labels*. In 2021 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data), pages 1625–1632. IEEE, 2021.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
