To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational Transfer Learning using Cross-Domain Latent Modulation" by Jinyong Hou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. This section is likely to contain detailed information about each dataset, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study.

In section 4.1, the authors mention several datasets:

1. **MNIST**: A widely used dataset for handwritten digit recognition, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Y. LeCun, L. Bottou, Y. Bengio, and P. Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 86, no. 11, pp. 2278–2324, 1998.

2. **MNISTM**: A modified version of MNIST with random RGB backgrounds. The citation is:
   > Y. Ganin et al. *Domain-adversarial training of neural networks*. Journal of Machine Learning Research, vol. 17, no. 59, pp. 1–35, 2016.

3. **USPS**: A dataset of handwritten digits containing 9,298 images. The citation is:
   > Y. Le Cun et al. *Handwritten digit recognition: Applications of neural network chips and automatic learning*. IEEE Communications Magazine, vol. 27, no. 11, pp. 41–46, 1989.

4. **Fashion-MNIST**: A dataset of clothing images for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. The citation is:
   > H. Xiao, K. Rasul, and R. Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv:1708.07747 [cs.LG], 2017.

5. **LineMod**: A dataset for 3D object recognition. The citation is:
   > S. Hinterstoisser et al. *Gradient response maps for real-time detection of texture-less objects*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 34, no. 5, pp. 876–888, 2012.

6. **CelebA**: A large-scale face dataset with annotations for facial attributes. The citation is:
   > Z. Liu et al. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 3730–3738, 2015.

7. **UT-Zap50K-shoes**: A dataset containing images of shoes. The citation is:
   > A. Yu and K. Grauman. *Semantic jitter: Dense supervision for visual comparisons via synthetic images*. In IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 5570–5579, 2017.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately noted their descriptions and how they relate to the experiments conducted in the paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation, ready for further processing or review.
