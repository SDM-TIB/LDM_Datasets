To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion-GAN: Training GANs with Diffusion" by Zhendong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate the advantages of Diffusion-GAN on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets they conducted experiments on, which include:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 50,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
2. **STL-10**: This dataset contains 100,000 unlabeled images in 10 classes, resized to 64x64 resolution.
3. **LSUN-Bedroom**: A dataset with 200,000 images from the bedroom category, resized to 256x256 resolution.
4. **LSUN-Church**: This dataset includes 125,000 images from the church category, also resized to 256x256 resolution.
5. **AFHQ**: A dataset containing around 5,000 images per category for cats, dogs, and wildlife, each at 512x512 resolution.
6. **FFHQ**: This dataset consists of 70,000 images crawled from Flickr at 1024x1024 resolution.

I will then verify the details of these datasets in the **appendices** or **references** section to ensure I have the correct citations. The paper provides citations for the datasets, which I will extract:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **STL-10**, the citation is:
  > Adam Coates, Andrew Ng, and Honglak Lee. *An Analysis of Single-Layer Networks in Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the fourteenth international conference on artificial intelligence and statistics, pages 215–223. JMLR Workshop and Conference Proceedings, 2011.

- For **LSUN datasets**, the citation is:
  > Fisher Yu, Ari Seff, Yinda Zhang, Shuran Song, Thomas Funkhouser, and Jianxiong Xiao. *LSUN: Construction of a Large-Scale Image Dataset Using Deep Learning with Humans in the Loop*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.03365, 2015.

- For **AFHQ**, the citation is:
  > Yunjey Choi, Youngjung Uh, Jaejun Yoo, and Jung-Woo Ha. *StarGAN v2: Diverse Image Synthesis for Multiple Domains*. 2020 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 8185–8194, 2020.

- For **FFHQ**, the citation is:
  > Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. *A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 4401–4410, 2019.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
