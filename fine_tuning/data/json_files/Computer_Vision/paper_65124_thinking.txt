To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative Quantum Machine Learning via Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models" by Peng Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their studies. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors refer to specific datasets, I will note down their names and any relevant details provided.

In this paper, I will pay special attention to any **figures or tables** that might summarize the datasets or provide additional context about their usage in the experiments. Figures often contain visual representations of data that can help clarify the datasets' characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure to note down the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "Clustered State Dataset" and provide a citation, I will record it as follows:
- For the "Clustered State Dataset," the citation might be:
  > Author(s). *Title of the Dataset Paper*. Journal Name, Year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate.
