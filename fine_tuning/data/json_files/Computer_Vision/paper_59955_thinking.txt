To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parents and Children: Distinguishing Multimodal DeepFakes from Natural Images" by Roberto Amoroso et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the release of a new dataset called **COCOFake**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research. The introduction further elaborates on the dataset, indicating that it contains approximately 600k images generated from original COCO images.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant subsections that provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. In this paper, the authors describe the **COCOFake dataset** in detail, explaining that it consists of real images from the COCO dataset paired with fake images generated from those real images using various textual captions.

In the **methodology** section, the authors provide specifics about how the COCOFake dataset was created, including the use of the **Stable Diffusion model** for generating fake images. They also mention the dataset's structure, which includes training, validation, and test splits, preserving the original COCO dataset's splits.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the COCO dataset, which is crucial for providing proper attribution. The citation for the COCO dataset is:

- **COCO Dataset**:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Doll√°r, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision, 2014.

Since the COCOFake dataset is derived from the COCO dataset, I will ensure to cite it properly as well. The authors do not provide a separate citation for COCOFake, but I will note that it is a new dataset introduced in this paper.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation for the original dataset. The key dataset to extract from this paper is:

1. **COCOFake Dataset**: A dataset containing approximately 600k images generated from original COCO images, used for evaluating deepfake detection methods.

The citation for the COCO dataset will be included as the authoritative reference for the images used in COCOFake.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for COCOFake, ensuring that it is ready for any required downstream processing or review.
