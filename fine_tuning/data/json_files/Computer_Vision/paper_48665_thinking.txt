To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non Gaussian Denoising Diffusion Models" by Eliya Nachmani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on image and speech generation tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention using two datasets for their experiments:

1. **LJ Speech Dataset**: This dataset is used for speech generation experiments. The authors reference it as being under a Public Domain license. 

2. **CelebA Dataset**: This dataset is used for image generation tasks. The authors note that it is under a non-commercial research purposes license.

3. **LSUN Church Dataset**: Another dataset mentioned for image generation, but the license is listed as unknown.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **LJ Speech Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Keith Ito and Linda Johnson. *The LJ Speech Dataset*. 2017. Available at: https://keithito.com/

- For the **CelebA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), December 2015.

- For the **LSUN Church Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Fisher Yu, Yinda Zhang, Shuran Song, Ari Seff, and Jianxiong Xiao. *LSUN: Construction of a Large-Scale Image Dataset Using Deep Learning with Humans in the Loop*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.03365, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
