To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MLGCN: An Ultra Efficient Graph Convolution Neural Model for 3D Point Cloud Analysis" by Mohammad Khodadad et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate the efficacy of their model on benchmark datasets for point cloud analysis, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In **section 4.2 (Classification)**, the authors mention using the **ModelNet-40 dataset** for evaluating their model's performance. This dataset consists of 9,843 training and 2,468 testing meshed CAD models from 40 distinct categories. This is a key dataset for the classification task.

In **section 4.3 (Segmentation)**, the authors refer to the **ShapeNetPart dataset**, which contains 16,881 3D shapes from 16 different classes, with each class having 2 to 6 parts. This dataset is crucial for the segmentation task and is explicitly mentioned as part of their evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **ModelNet-40 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhirong Wu, Shuran Song, Aditya Khosla, Fisher Yu, Linguang Zhang, Xiaoou Tang, and Jianxiong Xiao. *3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 1912–1920, 2015.

- For the **ShapeNetPart dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li Yi, Vladimir G Kim, Duygu Ceylan, I-Chao Shen, Mengyan Yan, Hao Su, Cewu Lu, Qixing Huang, Alla Sheffer, and Leonidas Guibas. *A Scalable Active Framework for Region Annotation in 3D Shape Collections*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (ToG), 35(6):1–12, 2016.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.
