To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Gaussian Splatting" by François Darmon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that they validate their contributions on benchmark datasets, specifically **ScanNet++** and **Deblur-NeRF**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) to gather more details about how these datasets were utilized. In Section 5.2, the authors describe their evaluation procedure on the **ScanNet++** dataset, which consists of low-quality smartphone videos and high-quality DSLR images. They emphasize that they only use the smartphone videos for testing due to coverage issues with the DSLR images.

In Section 5.4, the authors discuss the **Deblur-NeRF** dataset, which is used for evaluating deblurring capabilities. They mention that this dataset consists of multiple scenes with either motion or defocus blur, providing a perfect setup for benchmarking.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **ScanNet++**: The citation is:
   > Yeshwanth, C., Liu, Y.C., Nießner, M., & Dai, A. (2023). *ScanNet++: A high-fidelity dataset of 3D indoor scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

2. **Deblur-NeRF**: The citation is:
   > Ma, L., Li, X., Liao, J., Zhang, Q., Wang, X., Wang, J., & Sander, P.V. (2022). *Deblur-NERF: Neural radiance fields from blurry images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **ScanNet++**: A dataset containing low-quality smartphone videos and high-quality DSLR images for 3D indoor scene reconstruction.
- **Deblur-NeRF**: A dataset designed for evaluating deblurring capabilities in neural rendering, consisting of scenes with motion or defocus blur.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
