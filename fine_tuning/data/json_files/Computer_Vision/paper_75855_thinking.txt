To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DriveDiTFit: Fine-tuning Diffusion Transformers for Autonomous Driving" by Jiahang Tu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for high-quality training datasets in autonomous driving, which suggests that datasets will be a key focus of the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Related Work)**, where the authors discuss various autonomous driving datasets. Here, they mention several datasets, including:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: This dataset is widely used for driving algorithms and includes RGB, LiDAR, and GPS/IMU data. The authors note its limitations in terms of environmental conditions.

2. **nuScenes Dataset**: This dataset is highlighted for its multimodal capabilities and coverage of various weather conditions.

3. **Waymo Dataset**: The authors mention this dataset for its inclusion of night scenarios.

4. **Zenseact Dataset**: This dataset is noted for its diverse multimodal data.

5. **BDD100K Dataset**: This dataset is recognized for its size and diversity, covering multiple weather conditions.

6. **Ithaca365 Dataset**: This dataset is specifically mentioned in the experiments section, recorded under various weather and lighting conditions.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors provide further details about the **Ithaca365** and **BDD100K** datasets, confirming their use in the experiments. They describe the Ithaca365 dataset as containing scenario image data with balanced labels across varying conditions.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **KITTI Dataset**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations to ensure that they are ready for any further processing or review.
