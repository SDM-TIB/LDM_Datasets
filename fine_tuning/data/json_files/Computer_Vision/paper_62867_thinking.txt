To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Divert More Attention to Vision-Language Object Tracking" by Mingzhe Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the construction of a **large database with language annotation for model learning**, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the limitations of existing datasets. They mention that only **2,471 videos are annotated with language description** across several benchmarks, indicating that they are aware of the datasets used in the field.

In the **methodology section**, specifically in **section 3.1 (Attribute Annotation Strategy)**, the authors detail their approach to annotating six popular tracking datasets with language attributes. They explicitly list these datasets:

1. **LaSOT**: A high-quality benchmark for large-scale single object tracking, containing 1,120 videos.
2. **LaSOT-Extension**: An extension of LaSOT, containing additional videos.
3. **TNL2K**: A dataset with 1,300 videos.
4. **GOT-10K**: A dataset with 9,335 videos.
5. **TrackingNet**: A dataset with 10,044 videos.
6. **OTB99-Language**: A dataset with 51 videos annotated with language descriptions.

The authors also mention that they annotated these datasets with a new attribute annotation strategy, which contributes to a **large-scale vision-language tracking database with more than 23,000 videos**.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
