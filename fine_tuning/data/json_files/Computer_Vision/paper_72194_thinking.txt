To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Guess The Unseen: Dynamic 3D Scene Reconstruction from Partial 2D Glimpses" by Inhee Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or comparison.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 5.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will look for explicit mentions of dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Panoptic Dataset**: This dataset captures socially interacting multiple individuals via a multi-view camera system. The authors specify that they simulate a sparse 2D view scenario by selecting a single camera view as input for reconstruction.

2. **Hi4D Dataset**: This dataset contains multiple individuals at close distances, captured with synchronized cameras. The authors describe how they use specific sequences from this dataset for their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Panoptic Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hanbyul Joo, Tomas Simon, Xulong Li, Hao Liu, Lei Tan, Lin Gui, Sean Banerjee, Timothy Scott Godisart, Bart Nabbe, Iain Matthews, Takeo Kanade, Shohei Nobuhara, and Yaser Sheikh. *Panoptic Studio: A Massively Multiview System for Social Interaction Capture*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), 2017.

- For the **Hi4D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yifei Yin, Chen Guo, Manuel Kaufmann, Juan Zarate, Jie Song, and Otmar Hilliges. *Hi4D: 4D Instance Segmentation of Close Human Interaction*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
