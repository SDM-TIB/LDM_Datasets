To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion Models for Tabular Data Imputation and Synthetic Data Generation" by Mario VillaizÃ¡n-Vallelado et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conduct a comprehensive evaluation using benchmark datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets**. In this paper, it appears that the authors introduce the benchmark datasets in **section 5 (Experiments)**. I will carefully read through this section to identify each dataset mentioned, along with their characteristics and the tasks they are used for.

In section 5.1, the authors list several datasets, including:

1. **HELOC**: This dataset is described as containing anonymized credit applications with 21 numerical and 2 categorical features, used for a binary classification task.
2. **Churn Modelling**: This dataset consists of 6 numerical and 4 categorical features, also used for binary classification.
3. **Gas Concentrations**: This dataset includes measurements from chemical sensors with 129 continuous features, used for a multi-class classification task.
4. **California Housing**: This dataset is used for a regression task and contains various features related to housing prices.
5. **House Sales King County**: Similar to the California Housing dataset, this is also a regression task involving property prices.
6. **Adult Income**: This dataset is used to predict income levels based on personal details.
7. **Otto Group**: This dataset is a multi-class classification problem with product attributes.
8. **Cardiovascular Disease**: This dataset is used for predicting the presence of cardiovascular disease based on various features.
9. **Insurance**: This dataset is used for a binary classification task regarding customer payment behavior.
10. **Forest Cover Type**: This dataset is used for multi-class classification based on cartographic variables.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations may not always be directly provided in the text, so I will look for any references that correspond to the datasets mentioned.

For example, the citation for the **HELOC dataset** is:
> FICO. 2019. Home equity line of credit (HELOC) dataset. https://community.fico.com/s/explainable-machine-learning-challenge

Similarly, I will find citations for the other datasets, ensuring that I accurately capture the authors, titles, publication years, and any relevant URLs or DOIs.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their descriptions and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
