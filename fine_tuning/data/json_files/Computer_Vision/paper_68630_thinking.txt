To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards A Better Metric for Text-to-Video Generation" by Jay Zhangjie Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the introduction of the **TVGE dataset**, which is a strong indication that a dataset is present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (TVGE Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they describe the **Text-to-Video Generation Evaluation (TVGE) dataset**, which collects human judgments on 2,543 text-to-video generated videos. This section outlines the purpose of the dataset, the collection process, and the evaluation criteria.

In this section, I will note the following key details about the TVGE dataset:
- It is the first open-source dataset dedicated to benchmarking and enhancing evaluation metrics for text-to-video generation.
- The dataset includes human ratings on two aspects: text-video alignment and video quality.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the TVGE dataset. The authors reference the dataset's creation and its significance in the context of their research.

The citation for the TVGE dataset is:
> Wu, J. Z., Fang, G., Wu, H., Wang, X., Ge, Y., Liu, J. W., Gu, Y., Zhao, R., Cun, X., Lin, W., & Shou, M. Z. (2023). *Towards A Better Metric for Text-to-Video Generation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1-12.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the TVGE dataset as required.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and organized representation of the dataset extracted from the paper, ready for further analysis or processing.
