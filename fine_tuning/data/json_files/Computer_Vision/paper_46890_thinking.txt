To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reducing the Amortization Gap in Variational Autoencoders: A Bayesian Random Function Approach" by Minyoung Kim and Vladimir Pavlovic, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method is evaluated on several benchmark datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, consisting of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9).
2. **OMNIGLOT**: A dataset for one-shot learning, containing images of characters from various alphabets.
3. **CIFAR10**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.
4. **SVHN**: The Street View House Numbers dataset, which contains images of house numbers collected from Google Street View.
5. **CelebA**: A large-scale face attributes dataset with over 200,000 celebrity images, each annotated with 40 attribute labels.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., & Haffner, P. (1998). Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition. *Proceedings of the IEEE*, 86(11), 2278-2324.

- For **OMNIGLOT**, the citation is:
  > Lake, B. M., Salakhutdinov, R. R., & Tenenbaum, J. B. (2013). One-shot learning by inverting a compositional causal process. *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*.

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. *Technical report*, Computer Science Department, University of Toronto.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Netzer, Y., Wang, T., Coates, A., Bissacco, A., Wu, B., & Ng, A. Y. (2011). Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning.

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). Deep learning face attributes in the wild. *Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
