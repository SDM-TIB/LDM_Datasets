To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Artificial Neural Network Based Breast Cancer Screening: A Comprehensive Review" by Subrato Bharati et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper reviews various ANN models applied to publicly available datasets for breast cancer detection, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, particularly **Table 2**, which summarizes the performance of different deep learning models applied to several datasets for breast cancer classification. The datasets listed here are crucial for my extraction.

The datasets mentioned in the paper include:

1. **DDSM (Digital Database for Screening Mammography)**: This dataset is widely used for training and evaluating algorithms in mammography. It contains a large number of mammographic images.

2. **INBreast**: A dataset that includes annotated mammograms, specifically designed for breast cancer detection and classification.

3. **BCDR-FO3 (Breast Cancer Digital Repository - F03)**: This dataset is part of a larger repository aimed at breast cancer research, containing various imaging modalities.

4. **min-MIAS (Mini Mammographic Image Analysis Society)**: A smaller dataset that is often used for benchmarking algorithms in mammography.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented by the authors.
