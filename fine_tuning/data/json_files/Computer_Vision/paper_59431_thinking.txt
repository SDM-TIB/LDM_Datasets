To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Narrator: Towards Natural Control of Human-Scene Interaction Generation via Relationship Reasoning" by Haibiao Xuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a novel generative approach and mention that "the code and dataset will be available for research purposes," which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 7), where the authors discuss the datasets used for their evaluations. They mention that they annotated all video frames from the **PROX dataset** with corresponding textual descriptions about interactions. This is a clear indication that the PROX dataset is a primary dataset used in their research.

In section 7.1, the authors describe the **PROX dataset** in detail, stating that it records human activities in 3D scenes and that they designed a combinatorial template to describe human interaction and location in natural language descriptions. This confirms the dataset's relevance to their work.

Additionally, they mention evaluating their method on **Matterport3D** and **ScanNet**, which are also datasets used in their experiments. They clarify that these datasets are not utilized for training but are used to demonstrate the generalization capability of their framework.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **PROX dataset**, the citation is:
   > Mohamed Hassan, Vasileios Choutas, Dimitrios Tzionas, and Michael J. Black. *Resolving 3D human pose ambiguities with 3D scene constraints*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2282–2292, 2019.

2. For the **Matterport3D dataset**, the citation is:
   > Angel Chang, Angela Dai, Thomas Funkhouser, Maciej Halber, Matthias Niessner, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Andy Zeng, and Yinda Zhang. *Matterport3D: Learning from RGB-D data in indoor environments*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.06158, 2017.

3. For the **ScanNet dataset**, the citation is:
   > Angela Dai, Angel X Chang, Manolis Savva, Maciej Halber, Thomas Funkhouser, and Matthias Niessner. *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 5828–5839, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited for future reference.
