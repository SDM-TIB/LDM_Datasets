To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ED-SAM: An Efficient Diffusion Sampling Approach to Domain Generalization in Vision-Language Foundation Models" by Thanh-Dat Truong et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on various scales of vision-language pre-training datasets, specifically mentioning **CC3M, CC12M, and LAION400M**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for training their foundation model. They mention:

1. **Conceptual Captions 3M (CC3M)**: This dataset consists of 3 million image-text pairs, which is used for training vision-language models.
2. **Conceptual Captions 12M (CC12M)**: This is a larger dataset with 12 million image-text pairs, also aimed at enhancing the training of vision-language models.
3. **LAION400M**: This dataset contains 400 million image-text pairs and is utilized for large-scale training of vision-language models.

In the **References section**, I will find the full citations for these datasets to ensure proper attribution:

- For **Conceptual Captions 3M (CC3M)**, the citation is:
  > S. Changpinyo, P. Sharma, N. Ding, and R. Soricut. *Conceptual 3M: Pushing web-scale image-text pre-training to recognize long-tail visual concepts*. In CVPR, 2021.

- For **Conceptual Captions 12M (CC12M)**, the citation is:
  > S. Changpinyo, P. Sharma, N. Ding, and R. Soricut. *Conceptual 12M: Pushing web-scale image-text pre-training to recognize long-tail visual concepts*. In CVPR, 2021.

- For **LAION400M**, the citation is:
  > C. Schuhmann, R. Vencu, R. Beaumont, R. Kaczmarczyk, C. Mullis, A. Katta, T. Coombes, J. Jitsev, and A. Komatsuzaki. *Laion-400m: Open dataset of clip-filtered 400 million image-text pairs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.02114, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and attributed in the final output.
