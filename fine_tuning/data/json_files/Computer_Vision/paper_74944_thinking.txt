To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Sanity Check for AI-generated Image Detection" by Shilin Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors introduce the **Chameleon dataset**, which is specifically designed for evaluating AI-generated image detection methods. This is a clear indication that a dataset is present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors elaborate on the challenges of AI-generated image detection and mention the **Chameleon dataset** as a novel test set that includes images that are deceptively real and challenging for human perception. This section provides context for the dataset's purpose and significance.

Moving on to the **datasets section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the **Chameleon dataset**. The authors describe its collection process, curation, and annotation, emphasizing its features such as high resolution and diverse categories. They mention that the dataset contains over 11,000 high-fidelity AI-generated images sourced from platforms like ArtStation, Civitai, and Liblib, as well as real images from Unsplash.

In addition to the **Chameleon dataset**, the authors reference two existing benchmarks: **AIGCDetectBenchmark** and **GenImage**. I will ensure to extract details about these datasets as well, including their purpose and the types of images they contain.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The citations I need to gather include:

1. **Chameleon Dataset**: Since this is a novel dataset introduced by the authors, I will cite it as follows:
   > Yan, S., Li, O., Cai, J., Hao, Y., Jiang, X., Hu, Y., & Xie, W. (2023). A Sanity Check for AI-generated Image Detection. Preprint. Under review.

2. **AIGCDetectBenchmark**: The citation for this benchmark is:
   > Wang, S.-Y., Wang, O., Zhang, R., Owens, A., & Efros, A. A. (2020). CNN-generated images are surprisingly easy to spot... for now. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 8695â€“8704.

3. **GenImage**: The citation for this benchmark is:
   > Zhu, M., Chen, H., Yan, Q., Huang, X., Lin, G., Li, W., Tu, Z., Hu, J., & Wang, Y. (2024). GenImage: A million-scale benchmark for detecting AI-generated images. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 36.

After gathering all the necessary information and citations, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their full citations as required.
