To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Control3Diff: Learning Controllable 3D Diffusion Models from Single-view Images" by Jiatao Gu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their method on standard image generation benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental settings section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **FFHQ (Flickr-Faces-HQ)**: This dataset contains 70,000 high-resolution images of real human faces. The authors note that they used a downsampled version provided by EG3D, which includes camera pose estimates.

2. **AFHQ-cat**: This dataset consists of 5,000 images of cat faces, also in high resolution. Similar to FFHQ, the authors used a version with estimated camera poses.

3. **ShapeNet**: This dataset includes 3D models of various objects, specifically focusing on Cars and Chairs. The authors mention using a modified version of the dataset as provided by pixelNeRF, which includes a predefined train/val/test split.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **FFHQ**, the citation is:
  > Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. *A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 4401â€“4410, 2019.

- For **AFHQ**, the citation is:
  > Yunjey Choi, Youngjung Uh, Jaejun Yoo, and Jung-Woo Ha. *Stargan v2: Diverse image synthesis for multiple domains*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

- For **ShapeNet**, the citation is:
  > Angel X. Chang, et al. *ShapeNet: An Information-Rich 3D Model Repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
