To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distilling Inductive Bias: Knowledge Distillation Beyond Model Compression" by Gousia Habib et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of an ensemble-based distillation approach, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and experimental results sections**. In the **experimental results section**, the authors explicitly mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for their experiments. They describe it as a well-known benchmark in computer vision and deep learning, consisting of 60,000 images divided into ten distinct classes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The citation is typically provided in the references, and I will ensure to format it correctly.

The citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset is:
> Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009. Available at: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for CIFAR-10, ensuring that it includes all relevant details and the citation, ready for downstream processing or review.
