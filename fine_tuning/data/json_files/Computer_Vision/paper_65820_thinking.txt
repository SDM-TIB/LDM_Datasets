To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Follow Object-Centric Image Editing Instructions Faithfully" by Tuhin Chakrabarty et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. The abstract highlights the challenges in image editing with natural language instructions and references a dataset created by Brooks et al. (2023). This indicates that there is at least one dataset relevant to the research.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (Data)**, where the authors discuss problems with existing datasets and the curation of a new dataset. Here, they mention the dataset introduced by Brooks et al. (2023) and describe its limitations. This section is crucial as it provides insights into the datasets used and their characteristics.

In **subsection 2.3 (Test Data creation)**, the authors detail their test set, which consists of 465 <image, instruction> pairs. They mention two sources for their out-of-domain test set: the **MagicBrush dataset** and a dataset of visual metaphors. This is an important finding as it indicates multiple datasets are being utilized.

The paper also mentions the **InstructPix2Pix dataset** as a baseline for comparison. I will ensure to note this dataset as well.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **References section**:

1. **InstructPix2Pix Dataset**:
   - Citation:

2. **MagicBrush Dataset**:
   - Citation:

3. **Visual Metaphors Dataset**:
   - Citation:

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for further use or analysis.
