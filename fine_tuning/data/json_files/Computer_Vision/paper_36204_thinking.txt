To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporal 3D ConvNets: New Architecture and Transfer Learning for Video Classification" by Ali Diba et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using three datasets: **HMDB51**, **UCF101**, and **Kinetics**. I will note down the context in which these datasets are used, particularly focusing on their role in evaluating the proposed method.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets, including the number of clips, videos, and classes for each dataset. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope and relevance to the research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The relevant citations are:

1. **HMDB51 Dataset**:
   > Kuehne, H., Jhuang, H., Stiefelhagen, R., & Serre, T. (2013). *HMDB51: A large video database for human motion recognition*. In High Performance Computing in Science and Engineering.

2. **UCF101 Dataset**:
   > Soomro, K., Zamir, A. R., & Shah, M. (2012). *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv:1212.0402.

3. **Kinetics Dataset**:
   > Carreira, J., & Zisserman, A. (2017). *Quo vadis, action recognition? A new model and the kinetics dataset*. In CVPR.

With these citations, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its context and citation. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and ensure that all necessary information is captured for future reference or analysis.
