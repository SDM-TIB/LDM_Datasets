To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Boost Adversarial Transferability by Uniform Scale and Mix Mask Method" by Tao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions empirical evaluations on standard ImageNet datasets, which indicates that there is at least one dataset involved. I will note this down as a potential dataset.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their methods on the **ILSVRC 2012 validation set**. This is a specific dataset that I need to document.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the dataset used for their evaluations. They specify that they evaluate all methods on **1000 images from the ILSVRC 2012 validation set**. This confirms the dataset's relevance and usage in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ILSVRC 2012 dataset. The citation is typically included in the references, and I will ensure to extract it accurately.

The full citation for the ILSVRC 2012 dataset is:
> Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *Imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge*. International journal of computer vision, 115:211â€“252, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and the full citation as required.

In summary, the steps I followed are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Identify specific datasets in the methodology or experiments sections.
3. Confirm the dataset's usage in the experiments.
4. Retrieve the full citation from the references section.
5. Compile the dataset information for documentation.

This structured approach ensures that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
