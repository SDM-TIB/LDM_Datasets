To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CR-VAE: Contrastive Regularization on Variational Autoencoders for Preventing Posterior Collapse" by Fotios Lygerakis and Elmar Rueckert, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on a series of visual datasets, which indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset consisting of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits, split into a training set of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images.

2. **EMNIST**: An extension of MNIST that includes handwritten letters, consisting of 28x28 pixel grayscale images with 47 balanced classes, split into a training set of 112,800 images and a test set of 18,200 images.

3. **FashionMNIST**: A dataset of article images with the same characteristics as MNIST, also consisting of 28x28 pixel grayscale images.

4. **CIFAR10**: A dataset composed of 60,000 color images with a resolution of 32x32 pixels, classified into 10 distinct classes, with a training set of 50,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images.

5. **Omniglot**: A collection of handwritten characters from various alphabets, consisting of 1,623 different characters with 20 examples of each character, resized to match the dimensions of the other datasets.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their details from the paper.
