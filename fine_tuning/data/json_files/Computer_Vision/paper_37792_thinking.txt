To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SEMI-BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION WITH MULTICHANNEL VARIATIONAL AUTOENCODER" by Hirokazu Kameoka et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of blind source separation but do not specify any datasets. Next, I will look into the **experiments section** where datasets are typically described in detail.

In **section 5 (Experiments)**, the authors mention using the **Voice Conversion Challenge (VCC) 2018 dataset** for their experiments. They describe how they used utterances from this dataset, specifically recordings of six female and six male US English speakers. This section provides valuable information about the dataset used for training and evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the VCC 2018 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **Voice Conversion Challenge (VCC) 2018 dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Lorenzo-Trueba, J. Yamagishi, T. Toda, D. Saito, F. Villavicencio, T. Kinnunen, and Z. Ling. *The voice conversion challenge 2018: Promoting development of parallel and nonparallel methods*. eprint arXiv:1804.04262, Apr. 2018.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that the dataset entry is complete with the necessary details for clarity and reference.
