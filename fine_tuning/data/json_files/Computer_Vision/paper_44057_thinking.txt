To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing the Association in Multi-Object Tracking via Neighbor Graph" by Tianyi Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

In the **experiments section (Section 4)**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they state that they train their model on a collection of datasets, specifically mentioning:

1. **ETH Dataset**: This dataset is used for training the detection branch of their model.
2. **CityPerson Dataset**: Another dataset used for training the detection branch.
3. **CalTech Dataset**: This dataset is used for jointly training the ReID and detection branches.
4. **MOT17 Dataset**: This dataset is used for testing and evaluation.
5. **CUHK-SYSU Dataset**: This dataset is also used for jointly training the ReID and detection branches.
6. **PRW Dataset**: Another dataset used for jointly training the ReID and detection branches.
7. **MOT16 Dataset**: This dataset is used for testing and evaluation, alongside MOT17.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The citations I will extract are as follows:

- **ETH Dataset**:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the work presented in the paper.
