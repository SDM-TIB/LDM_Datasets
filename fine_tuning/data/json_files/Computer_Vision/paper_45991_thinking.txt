To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Utilizing UNet for the future traffic map prediction task: Traffic4cast challenge 2020" by Sungbin Choi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses experiments related to the Traffic4cast challenge, which suggests that there is a specific dataset associated with this challenge.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **methods** section, particularly in subsections that describe the input data. The paper discusses dynamic and static input data, but I need to determine if these refer to specific datasets or if they are derived from a larger dataset.

In the **methods section**, the author describes the input data as dynamic and static, but does not provide specific dataset names. However, the reference to the Traffic4cast challenge implies that the dataset used is the one provided by the challenge organizers.

I will then check the **references section** to find the citation for the Traffic4cast dataset. The first reference is a link to the Traffic4cast website, which likely contains the necessary information about the dataset. 

The citation for the Traffic4cast dataset is:
> IARAI. "Traffic4cast Challenge." Available at: https://www.iarai.ac.at/traffic4cast/

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the primary dataset used for the experiments is the Traffic4cast dataset.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as required. 

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Traffic4cast dataset, ensuring it is ready for structured output or further processing.
