To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Latent Preserving Generative Adversarial Network for Imbalance Classification" by Tanmoy Dam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were carried out on three different multi-class imbalanced problems, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits, commonly used for image classification tasks.
2. **Fashion-MNIST**: A dataset that serves as a drop-in replacement for MNIST, containing images of clothing items.
3. **CelebA**: A large-scale face attributes dataset with images of celebrities, used for various computer vision tasks.

I will also check the **table** that summarizes the datasets to gather additional details such as dimensions, imbalance ratios, and the number of classes.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun. "The MNIST database of handwritten digits." http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, 1998.

- For **Fashion-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. "Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms." arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. "Deep learning face attributes in the wild." In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2015, pp. 3730â€“3738.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for any further processing or review.
