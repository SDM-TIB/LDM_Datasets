To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revising Densification in Gaussian Splatting" by Samuel Rota Bulò et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions, but the introduction is likely to contain more specific references to datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they validate their contributions on standard benchmark datasets. This indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to locate their specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Evaluation)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets and metrics)**. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets they used for their experiments:

1. **Mip-NeRF 360**: This dataset comprises nine scenes (5 outdoor, 4 indoor) captured in a circular pattern, focusing on a central area of a few meters, with a potentially unbounded background.

2. **Tanks and Temples**: The authors specifically mention focusing on the “Truck” and “Train” scenes from this dataset.

3. **Deep Blending**: They focus on the “Dr Johnson” and “Playroom” scenes, using images and SfM reconstructions shared by the Gaussian Splatting authors.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Mip-NeRF 360**, the citation is:
  > Barron, J.T., Mildenhall, B., Verbin, D., Srinivasan, P.P., Hedman, P. (2022). *Mipnerf 360: Unbounded anti-aliased neural radiance fields*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 5470–5479.

- For **Tanks and Temples**, the citation is:
  > Knapitsch, A., Park, J., Zhou, Q.Y., Koltun, V. (2017). *Tanks and temples: Benchmarking large-scale scene reconstruction*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (ToG), 36(4), 1–13.

- For **Deep Blending**, the citation is:
  > Hedman, P., Philip, J., Price, T., Frahm, J.M., Drettakis, G., Brostow, G. (2018). *Deep blending for free-viewpoint image-based rendering*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (ToG), 37(6), 1–15.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
