To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learned Initializations for Optimizing Coordinate-Based Neural Representations" by Matthew Tancik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses various tasks, including representing 2D images, reconstructing CT scans, and recovering 3D shapes and scenes, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Results)**, where the authors describe the tasks and datasets used. In **subsection 4.1 (Tasks)**, the authors explicitly mention several datasets:

1. **CelebA Dataset**: This dataset consists of images of faces and is used for image regression tasks. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 373–378, 2015.

2. **Imagenette Dataset**: This dataset is a subset of ImageNet, used for natural image tasks. The citation is:
   > Jeremy Howard. *Imagenette*. 2019.

3. **Text Dataset**: This dataset consists of images of text, but the paper does not provide a specific citation. I will note that it is a general category without a formal reference.

4. **SDF Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2D signed distance fields of simple curves. Similar to the Text dataset, it does not have a specific citation provided in the paper.

5. **ShapeNet Dataset**: This dataset is used for view synthesis tasks and includes 3D models. The citation is:
   > Angel X. Chang et al. *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. Technical report, 2015.

6. **Phototourism Dataset**: This dataset consists of posed tourist photographs of famous landmarks. The citation is:
   > Yuhe Jin et al. *Image matching across wide baselines: From paper to practice*. International Journal of Computer Vision, pages 1–31, 2020.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to check the **References section** for any additional details or citations that may be relevant. 

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include full citations for each dataset where applicable. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, along with their authoritative references.
