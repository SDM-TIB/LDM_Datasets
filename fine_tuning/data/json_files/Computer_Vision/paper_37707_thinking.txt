To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Take a Look Around: Using Street View and Satellite Images to Estimate House Prices" by Stephen Law et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize street and aerial images to estimate house prices, suggesting that there are datasets related to these images.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically **section 3 (Method and Materials)**, where the authors describe the data collection process. Here, they mention three distinct datasets:

1. **Traditional Housing Attributes Dataset**: This dataset includes structural, neighborhood, and location features derived from the UK Land Registry Price Paid dataset and additional property attributes from the Nationwide Housing Society. It consists of 130,557 transactions grouped to the nearest street, resulting in 40,470 streets with at least one property transaction.

2. **Street Images Dataset**: This dataset is composed of street images collected from the Google Street View API. The authors collected one front-facing image for each street in Greater London, resulting in a total of 111,701 images. They detail the process of ensuring the images are valid and front-facing.

3. **Aerial Images Dataset**: This dataset includes aerial images obtained from the Microsoft Bing Images API. Similar to the street images, one aerial image was collected for each street in Greater London, also totaling 111,701 images.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss how these datasets were used in their experiments, confirming their relevance and application in the study.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **UK Land Registry Price Paid dataset**, the citation is:
  > UK Land Registry. *UK Land Registry Price Paid Data*. Available at: https://www.gov.uk/search-house-prices. (2017).

- For the **Nationwide Housing Society dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nationwide. *Auxiliary Housing Attributes*. Permission of use from London School of Economics. Available at: https://www.nationwide.co.uk/. (2012).

- For the **Google Street View API**, the citation is:
  > Google. *Google Street View API*. Available at: https://www.maps.google.com/. (2018).

- For the **Microsoft Bing Images API**, the citation is:
  > Microsoft. *Bing Maps API*. Available at: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/maps/choose-your-bing-maps-api. (2018).

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and attributed.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
