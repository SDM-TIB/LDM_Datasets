To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FFB6D: A Full Flow Bidirectional Fusion Network for 6D Pose Estimation" by Yisheng He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the method is evaluated on several benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the importance of 6D pose estimation and reference various datasets. Specifically, they mention that they conduct experiments on three benchmark datasets, which is a clear indication that I need to find the names and details of these datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **YCB-Video Dataset**: This dataset contains 92 RGBD videos capturing scenes of 21 selected YCB objects. The authors mention that they followed previous works for splitting the training and testing sets, and they also used synthetic images for training.

2. **LineMOD Dataset**: This dataset consists of 13 videos of low-textured objects. The authors note the challenges posed by texture-less objects and varying lighting conditions, and they describe how they split the training and testing sets.

3. **Occlusion LineMOD Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the LineMOD dataset and consists of scenes with heavily occluded objects. The authors highlight the challenges presented by occlusion in this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **YCB-Video Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **LineMOD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Stefan Hinterstoisser, Cedric Cagniart, Slobodan Ilic, Peter Sturm, Nassir Navab, Pascal Fua, and Vincent Lepetit. *Gradient Response Maps for Real-Time Detection of Textureless Objects*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 34(5):876–888, 2011.

- For the **Occlusion LineMOD Dataset**, the citation is:

In 2011 International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 858–865, IEEE, 2011.

With this information gathered, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
