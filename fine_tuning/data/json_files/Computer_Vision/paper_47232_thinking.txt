To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Implementing graph neural networks with TensorFlow-Keras" by Patrick Reiser et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on graph neural networks and their implementation, but it does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the experiments or evaluations. The introduction discusses various graph neural network architectures and their applications but does not specify any datasets.

Moving on to the **main body of the paper**, particularly the sections that discuss experiments or results, I will look for any tables or figures that might list datasets. In the **table provided**, the authors mention the **QM9 dataset** as a benchmark dataset used for testing the models implemented in their package, kgcnn. This is a crucial finding, as it indicates that the QM9 dataset is relevant to their work.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the QM9 dataset. The reference list includes the following citation for the QM9 dataset:

- **QM9 Dataset**: 
  > Ramakrishnan, R.; Dral, P. O.; Rupp, M.; von Lilienfeld, O. A. Quantum Chemistry Structures and Properties of 134 Kilo Molecules. *Sci. Data* 2014, 1 (1), 140022. https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2014.22.

Since the QM9 dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will document it accordingly.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
