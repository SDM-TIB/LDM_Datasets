To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inter-Frame Compression for Dynamic Point Cloud Geometry Coding" by Anique Akhtar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a deep learning-based inter-frame encoding scheme for dynamic point clouds, which suggests that datasets related to point clouds may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section**, specifically looking for any mention of datasets used for training and testing the proposed method. In this section, the authors state that they used a total of eight different sequences for dynamic point cloud datasets, which is a clear indication that multiple datasets are involved.

I will list the datasets mentioned:

1. **8i Voxelized Full Bodies dataset (8iVFB v2)**: The authors mention using sequences such as longdress, loot, redandblack, and soldier from this dataset. This dataset is crucial as it provides the dynamic point cloud sequences necessary for their experiments.

2. **Technicolor dataset**: The authors refer to the queen sequence from Technicolor, indicating that this dataset is also part of their evaluation.

3. **Owlii Dynamic Human Textured Mesh Sequence Dataset**: The authors mention using basketball, exercise, and model sequences from this dataset, which further contributes to their experimental analysis.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **8i Voxelized Full Bodies dataset (8iVFB v2)**, the citation is:
  > E. dâ€™Eon, B. Harrison, T. Myers, and P. A. Chou. *8i Voxelized Full Bodies*. ISO/IEC document JTC1/SC29/WG11 M40059/WG1 M74006, 2017.

- For the **Owlii Dynamic Human Textured Mesh Sequence Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. Xu, Y. Lu, and Z. Wen. *Owlii Dynamic Human Mesh Sequence Dataset*. ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11 m41658, 2017.

- The **Technicolor dataset** does not have a specific citation provided in the references, but it is mentioned as a source for the queen sequence.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that full citations are included for reference. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
