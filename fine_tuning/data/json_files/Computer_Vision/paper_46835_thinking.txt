To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Video Reenactment as Inductive Bias for Content-Motion Disentanglement" by J. F. Hernández Albarracín and A. Ramírez Rivera, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for a subsection that discusses datasets. In this paper, the authors mention several datasets used for their experiments, including:

1. **Cohn-Kanade (CK+) facial dataset**: This dataset consists of 326 gray-scale videos of 64×64 pixels of 118 characters performing six actions: anger, disgust, fear, happy, sad, and surprise.

2. **Liberated Pixel Cup (LPC)**: The authors generated 10,000 RGB videos of 64×64 pixels, creating 24 motion classes performed by characters, which correspond to six actions times four perspectives.

3. **Moving MNIST (MMNIST)**: This dataset includes 10,000 binary videos of 64×64 pixels with ten identities corresponding to the digits from 0 to 9, with each video having 32 frames.

4. **Deepmind’s dSprites**: The authors generated 10,000 videos of 64×64 pixels from the images provided, with moving sprites having various sizes and shapes.

5. **Deepmind’s 3dShapes**: This dataset consists of 10,000 videos of 64×64 pixels, where various factors such as floor hue, wall hue, object hue, shape, and size are manipulated.

6. **Multimedia Understanding Group (MUG) facial dataset**: This dataset contains 931 RGB videos of 64×64 pixels of 52 characters performing six actions.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

  > N. Aifanti, C. Papachristou, and A. Delopoulos. "The MUG Facial Expression Database". In: International Workshop on Image Analysis for Multimedia Interactive Services, 2010.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.
