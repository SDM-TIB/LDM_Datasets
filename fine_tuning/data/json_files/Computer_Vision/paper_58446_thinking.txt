To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Class Overwhelms: Mutual Conditional Blended-Target Domain Adaptation" by Pengcheng Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the evaluation of their method on standard BTDA tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of blended targets domain adaptation (BTDA) and mention the need for datasets that reflect diverse styles and textures. However, I need to find specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they explicitly mention the datasets:

1. **Office-31**: This dataset is used for domain adaptation tasks and consists of images from 31 categories, with three domains: Amazon, Webcam, and DSLR.

2. **Office-Home**: This dataset contains images from 65 categories across four domains: Art, Clipart, Product, and Real-World.

3. **DomainNet**: A large-scale dataset for domain adaptation that includes six domains: Clipart, Infograph, Painting, Quickdraw, Real, and Sketch.

4. **Office-Home-LMT**: A specialized dataset created for label shift in BTDA, which is a variant of the Office-Home dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Office-31**, the citation is:
  > Saenko, K., Kulis, B., Fritz, M., & Darrell, T. (2010). *Adapting visual category models to new domains*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (pp. 213–226). Springer.

- For **Office-Home**, the citation is:
  > Venkateswara, H., Eusebio, J., Chakraborty, S., & Panchanathan, S. (2017). *Deep hashing network for unsupervised domain adaptation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (pp. 5018–5027).

- For **DomainNet**, the citation is:
  > Peng, X., Bai, Q., Xia, X., Huang, Z., Saenko, K., & Wang, B. (2019). *Moment matching for multi-source domain adaptation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (pp. 1406–1415).

- For **Office-Home-LMT**, the citation is:
  > Xu, P., Gurram, P., Whipps, G., & Chellappa, R. (2023). *Class Overwhelms: Mutual Conditional Blended-Target Domain Adaptation*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its corresponding citation.
