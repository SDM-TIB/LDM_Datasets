To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Localized Mutual Information Monitoring of Pairwise Associations in Animal Movement" by Andrew B. Whetten, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the use of GPS tracking data for animal movement, which suggests that there may be datasets related to animal tracking. I will look for specific mentions of datasets or studies that provide data for the analysis.

Next, I will review the **methods** section, as it often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for simulations or analyses. In this section, the author mentions the use of a measure of localized mutual information (LMI) and references a previous implementation involving a collection of jaguars in the Pantanal Ecological Station in Brazil. This indicates that there is a dataset related to jaguar movements.

I will also check the **simulation studies** section, where the author describes various simulations involving animal movements. Each simulation may reference specific datasets or types of data used to model animal behavior. For example, the author mentions simulations involving male-female jaguar relationships, which likely rely on specific tracking datasets.

After identifying potential datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The author references previous works that may have published the datasets or provided the data used in the simulations.

For example, the paper mentions the use of jaguar movement data, which can be traced back to the following citation:
- Whetten, A.B. (2021). *Smoothing Splines of Apex Predator Movement: Functional modeling strategies for exploring animal behavior and social interactions*. Authorea. 

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the context of animal tracking or movement ecology, ensuring to document their full citations as well.

Once I have gathered all relevant datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
