To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How to Improve the Interpretability of Kernel Learning" by Jinwei Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any subsection that discusses datasets. In this paper, the authors mention several benchmark datasets used for their experiments, including:

1. **Friedman Dataset**: This dataset is described as a common nonlinear regression dataset with 50 samples generated by a specific function. The authors mention variations of this dataset with added Gaussian noise.

2. **Plane Dataset**: A linear regression dataset with 60 samples generated by a plane function, also with variations that include additional noise.

3. **Multi Dataset**: Another nonlinear regression dataset generated by a multi-function, with 60 samples and variations that include added noise.

4. **Gabor Dataset**: This dataset is generated by a Gabor function and includes variations with different noise levels.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations may not always be explicitly listed as datasets, but I will look for any references that describe the datasets or their original sources.

For example, the Friedman dataset is often referenced in literature, and I can find its citation as follows:
- Friedman Dataset Citation: Friedman, J. H. (1991). Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines. *The Annals of Statistics*, 19(1), 1-67.

Similarly, I will look for citations for the Plane, Multi, and Gabor datasets, which may be referenced in the context of their original publications or as part of benchmark studies.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
