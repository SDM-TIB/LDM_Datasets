To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Generalization and Stability of Generative Adversarial Networks" by Hoang Thanh-Tung et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments on "synthetic and large scale datasets," which indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look into **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experiments in detail. Here, they mention using several datasets, including:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits used for training various image processing systems.
2. **ImageNet Dataset**: A large-scale dataset used for image classification and object detection tasks.

In the experiments, the authors provide insights into how their proposed method (zero-centered gradient penalty) performs on these datasets, confirming their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 2010. [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

- For the **ImageNet Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L.-J. Li, K. Li, and L. Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In CVPR09, 2009.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I have extracted the following datasets from the paper:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: A dataset of handwritten digits.
   - Citation: Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 2010. [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

2. **ImageNet Dataset**: A large-scale dataset for image classification.
   - Citation: J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L.-J. Li, K. Li, and L. Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In CVPR09, 2009.

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the research paper.
