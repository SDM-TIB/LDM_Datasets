To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DiffSmooth: Certifiably Robust Learning via Diffusion Models and Local Smoothing" by Jiawei Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted extensive experiments on different datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and characteristics. The authors mention conducting experiments on **CIFAR-10** and **ImageNet**, which are well-known datasets in the field of machine learning.

I will also check the **related work section** and **conclusion** for any additional datasets that may have been referenced or used in prior studies that the authors built upon.

Once I identify the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. For instance, CIFAR-10 is often cited as follows:
- **CIFAR-10**: 
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

And for ImageNet, the citation is typically:
- **ImageNet**: 
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248â€“255. IEEE, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
