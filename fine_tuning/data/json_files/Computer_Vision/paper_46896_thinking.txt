To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rapid Classification of Glaucomatous Fundus Images" by Vasudevan Lakshminarayanan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors used the **Drishti-GS** and **RIM-ONE-r2** datasets for training and testing their model. This gives me a clear indication of the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** and **methodology sections** to gather more details about these datasets. In the **methodology section**, specifically in **2.1 Dataset Description**, the authors provide specific information about both datasets:

1. **RIM-ONE-r2**: This dataset consists of 455 colored fundus images, with 255 labeled as normal and 200 as glaucomatous or suspected to have glaucoma. The dataset is a sub-dataset of the Open Retinal Image Database for Optic Nerve Evaluation.

2. **DRISHTI-GS**: This dataset contains 101 uncropped fundus images, annotated by five clinicians into normal and glaucoma classes. It includes 70 glaucomatous images and 31 normal images.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **RIM-ONE-r2**:
  > Fumero, F., AlayÃ³n, S., Sanchez, J.L., Sigut, J., Gonzalez-Hernandez, M. (2011). RIM-ONE: An open retinal image database for optic nerve evaluation. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI), pages 599-604. doi: 10.1109/CBMS.2011.5999143.

- For **DRISHTI-GS**:
  > Sivaswamy, J., Krishnadas, S. R., Joshi, G. D., Jain, M., & Tabish, A. U. S. (2014). Drishti-gs: Retinal image dataset for optic nerve head (ONH) segmentation. In 2014 IEEE 11th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI), pages 53-56. doi: 10.1109/ISBI.2014.6867807.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
