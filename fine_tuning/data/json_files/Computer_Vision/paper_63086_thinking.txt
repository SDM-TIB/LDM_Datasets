To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Founding a mathematical diffusion model in linguistics. The case study of German syntactic features in the North-Eastern Italian dialects" by Ignazio Lazzizzera, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on the diffusion of Germanic syntactic features, which may hint at the data sources used.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. In this paper, the author discusses the use of the VinKo platform, which is a spoken corpus based on crowd-sourced audio recordings. This indicates that the VinKo dataset is a primary source of linguistic data for the study.

I will also check the **data analysis section** for any additional datasets that may be referenced or utilized in the analysis. The author mentions that the linguistic data were georeferentially extracted and reprocessed from the VinKo platform, confirming its significance in the research.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the VinKo dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Romano Madaro et al. *VinKo: Varieties in Contact*. Eurac Research CLARIN Centre, 2022. Available at: http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12124/46.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will focus on the VinKo dataset for my extraction.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation for the VinKo dataset. This will provide a clear and concise summary of the dataset used in the research.
