To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Bridging the Cross-modal Semantic Gap for Multi-modal Recommendation" by Xinglong Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that extensive experiments were conducted on three public datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this case, I will look for a section that explicitly lists the datasets, which is often labeled as "Datasets" or something similar.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention three datasets: **Amazon-Baby**, **Amazon-Sports**, and **Amazon-Clothing**. They provide some statistics about these datasets, such as the number of users, items, interactions, and density, which is useful for understanding the context of the datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

The citations I find are as follows:

1. **Amazon-Baby Dataset**:
   > He, R., & McAuley, J. J. (2016a). Ups and Downs: Modeling the Visual Evolution of Fashion Trends with One-Class Collaborative Filtering. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web, 507–517.

2. **Amazon-Sports Dataset**:
   > McAuley, J. J., Targett, C., Shi, Q., & van den Hengel, A. (2015). Image-Based Recommendations on Styles and Substitutes. In Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, 43–52.

3. **Amazon-Clothing Dataset**:
   > He, R., & McAuley, J. J. (2016a). Ups and Downs: Modeling the Visual Evolution of Fashion Trends with One-Class Collaborative Filtering. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web, 507–517.

(Note: The citation for Amazon-Clothing is the same as for Amazon-Baby, indicating that they may refer to the same source or dataset.)

Having gathered the dataset names and their citations, I will now summarize the findings:

- **Amazon-Baby**: A dataset used for multi-modal recommendation, with specific statistics provided in the paper.
- **Amazon-Sports**: Another dataset utilized in the experiments, also with detailed statistics.
- **Amazon-Clothing**: The third dataset mentioned, with similar characteristics.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or analysis.
