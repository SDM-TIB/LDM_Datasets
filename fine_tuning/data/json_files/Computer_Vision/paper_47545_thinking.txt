To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fully Automated 2D and 3D Convolutional Neural Networks Pipeline for Video Segmentation and Myocardial Infarction Detection in Echocardiography" by Oumaima Hamila et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a specific dataset, the **HMC-QU dataset**, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of the dataset in the **methodology section**. In section 3.2, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the **HMC-QU dataset**, stating that it consists of 162 annotated echocardiography videos obtained from the Hamad Medical Corporation between 2018 and 2019. They mention that the dataset includes videos of both myocardial infarction (MI) patients and normal patients, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

I will also check the **results section** to confirm that the dataset was used for training and testing their models. The authors report performance metrics achieved on the HMC-QU dataset, which reinforces its significance in their research.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the dataset from the **references section**. The citation for the HMC-QU dataset is as follows:
> Degerli A, Zabihi M, Kiranyaz S, Hamid T, Mazhar R, Hamila R, and Gabbouj M. *HMC-QU dataset*. Hamad Medical Corporation. Available at: https://www.hamad.qa/EN/Pages/default.aspx. Accessed: 2020-09-24.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
