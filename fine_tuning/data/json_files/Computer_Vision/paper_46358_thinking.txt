To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatial Context-Aware Self-Attention Model For Multi-Organ Segmentation" by Hao Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention the datasets used. The introduction typically elaborates on the significance of the study and may reference specific datasets that are crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they describe two datasets:

1. **MICCAI 2015 head and neck (HaN) organ-at-risk (OAR) segmentation challenge dataset**: This dataset contains a training set of 33 CT images and a test set of 15 CT images, with manually labeled organ segmentation masks for 9 organs, including the brain stem, mandible, optic nerves, and parotid glands.

2. **In-house abdomen multi-organ segmentation dataset (ABD-110)**: This dataset consists of 110 contrast-enhanced CT images and includes 11 organs such as the large bowel, liver, and kidneys. The CT scans were manually delineated by an experienced doctor.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **MICCAI 2015 dataset**, the citation is:
> Raudaschl, P. et al. "Evaluation of segmentation methods on head and neck CT: auto-segmentation challenge 2015." *Medical Physics*, 44(5):2020â€“2036, 2017.

For the **ABD-110 dataset**, since it is an in-house dataset, it may not have a formal citation in the references. However, I will note that the dataset was collected from patients who had radiotherapy, and it has been approved by an institutional review board (IRB).

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the full citations where applicable. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.
