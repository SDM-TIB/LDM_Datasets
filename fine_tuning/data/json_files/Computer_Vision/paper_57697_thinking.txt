To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards deep generation of guided wave representations for composite materials" by Mahindra Rautela et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract highlights the challenges of dataset availability for composite materials, indicating that the authors have created datasets through simulations.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Theoretical Background)** and **section III (Results and Discussion)**, where the authors discuss the dataset collection process. In section II, they mention using the stiffness matrix method (SMM) to generate polar group velocity representations for different composite materials. This suggests that a dataset has been created based on these simulations.

In section III, the authors describe two datasets:

1. **Dataset-1**: This dataset includes polar representations corresponding to 10 materials with 10 different frequencies for each Lamb mode and three different ply-layup sequences (unidirectional, cross-ply, and quasi-isotropic). The total number of samples in Dataset-1 is 600.

2. **Dataset-2**: This dataset contains representations of 987 materials with 10 different frequencies for each Lamb mode and a unidirectional layup. The total number of samples in Dataset-2 is 19,740.

The authors also provide a link to access the datasets, which is crucial for citation purposes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to their own previous work for the dataset creation process, which is essential for proper citation.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Dataset-1**, the citation is:
  > Mahindra Rautela, J. Senthilnath, A. Huber, and S. Gopalakrishnan. *Guided wave representations dataset for material property estimation and generation [data set]*. Zenodo. Available at: https://zenodo.org/record/7301863.

- For **Dataset-2**, since it is part of the same dataset collection, it will have the same citation as Dataset-1.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ready for structured output or further processing.
