To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ModGNN: Expert Policy Approximation in Multi-Agent Systems with a Modular Graph Neural Network Architecture" by Ryan Kortvelesy and Amanda Prorok, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the application of their framework to the multi-agent flocking problem, which suggests that they may have used specific datasets for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to prior work that may indicate the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors describe their methodology and the specific datasets they utilized for training and evaluation. They mention using a dataset generated by an expert algorithm for the flocking problem, which is crucial for understanding the performance of their models.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that they conducted experiments using a dataset of **1000 episodes**, each with **1000 timesteps**, generated in a **PyBullet** environment. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset, as it appears to be a custom dataset created for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to see if they cite any foundational datasets or prior works that may have contributed to their dataset creation. In this case, they reference the Reynolds flocking algorithm, which is a well-known method in the field, but they do not provide a specific dataset citation.

Since the dataset is custom and not formally published, I will note that in my extraction. However, I will still provide a citation for the foundational work they reference, which is important for context.

The citation for the Reynolds flocking algorithm is:
> C. W. Reynolds, “Flocks, herds and schools: A distributed behavioral model,” in Proceedings of the 14th Annual Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques (SIGGRAPH), 1987, pp. 25–34.

Now, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset in a structured manner, ensuring to include the relevant citations.

1. **Custom Dataset for Flocking Problem**: A dataset of 1000 episodes, each with 1000 timesteps, generated in a PyBullet environment for evaluating the ModGNN framework.
   - Citation: Not applicable (custom dataset).

2. **Reynolds Flocking Algorithm**: The foundational algorithm referenced for generating the expert policy.
   - Citation: C. W. Reynolds, “Flocks, herds and schools: A distributed behavioral model,” in Proceedings of the 14th Annual Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques (SIGGRAPH), 1987, pp. 25–34.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries for review or further processing.
