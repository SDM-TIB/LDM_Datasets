To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Survey of Diffusion Based Image Generation Models: Issues and Their Solutions" by Zheng Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the advancements in image generation models but does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various models like DALLÂ·E 2 and Stable Diffusion but do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **main body of the paper**, particularly looking for sections that detail experiments or methodologies involving datasets.

As I progress through the paper, I will pay special attention to **Table 1**, which summarizes existing diffusion models and their associated techniques. This table may provide insights into datasets used in the context of these models.

Next, I will look for any **references to datasets** in the context of specific models or techniques discussed throughout the paper. For instance, if a model is mentioned alongside a dataset, I will note that down.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

For example, if the paper references the **Coco dataset** or **ImageNet**, I will look for the complete citation for each of these datasets in the references. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for presentation or further processing, ensuring that all dataset citations are accurate and complete.
