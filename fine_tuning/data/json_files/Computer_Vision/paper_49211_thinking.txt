To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Characterization Multimodal Connectivity of Brain Network by Hypergraph GAN for Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Analysis" by Junren Pan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors used publicly available data from the **ADNI database** to evaluate their model. This suggests that the ADNI dataset is a key dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **methodology** section, particularly in **section 2.1 (Data and Pre-processing)**. Here, the authors mention that they selected a total of **219 subjects from the ADNI database**, detailing the composition of the dataset, which includes various groups of patients (AD, LMCI, EMCI, and NC). This section provides valuable information about the dataset's structure and the specific populations involved.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The ADNI database is a well-known resource, and the citation typically includes the following:

- For the **ADNI database**, the citation is:
  > Jack, C.R., Bernstein, M.A., Fox, N.C., et al. *The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI): MRI methods.* NeuroImage, 2008.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **ADNI Database**: This dataset includes neuroimaging data from 219 subjects, comprising patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal controls (NC). The dataset is used to analyze multimodal connectivity in the context of Alzheimer's disease.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included.
