To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CA-Stream: Attention-based pooling for interpretable image recognition" by Felipe Torres et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the design of an attention-based pooling mechanism but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, I will look for any mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the experiments section, I find that the authors mention using the **ImageNet ILSVRC-2012 dataset** for training and evaluation. This dataset is a well-known benchmark in image recognition tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The citation for the ImageNet dataset is:

- **ImageNet ILSVRC-2012 dataset**:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255, 2009.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the ImageNet dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the ImageNet dataset, ensuring that it is clear and complete for any downstream processing or review.
