To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Black Box Few-Shot Adaptation for Vision-Language models" by Yassine Ouali et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on **11 image and 2 video datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the text, the authors refer to several datasets used for evaluation, including:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset commonly used for image classification tasks.
2. **Caltech101**: A dataset containing images of 101 object categories.
3. **OxfordPets**: A dataset for classifying images of pets.
4. **Stanford-Cars**: A dataset for fine-grained classification of car models.
5. **Flowers102**: A dataset for flower classification.
6. **Food101**: A dataset containing images of food items.
7. **FGVC Aircraft**: A dataset for fine-grained classification of aircraft.
8. **SUN397**: A dataset for scene recognition.
9. **UCF101**: A dataset for action recognition in videos.
10. **DTD (Describable Textures Dataset)**: A dataset for texture classification.
11. **EuroSAT**: A dataset for land use and land cover classification.
12. **HMDB51**: A dataset for human action recognition in videos.

The authors also mention that they used **UCF101** for action recognition, confirming its relevance in both image and video contexts.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
