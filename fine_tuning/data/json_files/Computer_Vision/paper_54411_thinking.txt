To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TTS-by-TTS: Data-Selective Augmentation for Neural Speech Synthesis" by Eunwoo Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of synthetic corpora for training TTS systems, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (TTS-driven data augmentation)**, specifically **subsection 2.1 (Database)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention a phonetically balanced Korean corpus recorded by a professional speaker, detailing the number of utterances and their duration. This indicates that this corpus is a key dataset for their study.

In this subsection, the authors specify:
- **Korean Corpus**: This dataset consists of 1,000 utterances (1.8 hours), 270 utterances (0.5 hours), and 130 utterances (0.2 hours) used for training, validation, and testing, respectively.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. Since the authors do not provide a specific citation for the Korean corpus, I will note that it is an internal dataset used in their experiments without a formal citation.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, particularly in the **experiments section**. However, the focus seems to be primarily on the Korean corpus, and no other external datasets are explicitly cited.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the findings:
1. **Korean Corpus**: A phonetically balanced dataset recorded by a professional speaker, consisting of 1,000 training utterances, 270 validation utterances, and 130 testing utterances.

Since there are no additional datasets mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format for clarity.

In conclusion, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their significance in the context of the research, while also noting the absence of formal citations for the internal dataset used.
