To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting the relationship between visual and textual features in social networks for image classification with zero-shot deep learning" by Luis Lucas et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **InstaNY100K dataset** and the **Places dataset**, which indicates that these datasets are relevant to the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experimental setup section**. Here, the authors describe the **InstaNY100K dataset** as containing social media images with associated text, specifically mentioning that it comprises 100,000 image-text pairs from New York, totaling 1 million images across 10 cities. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Additionally, the authors reference the **Places dataset**, which is used for classifying images into 205 types of places. This dataset is essential for understanding the classification tasks performed in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **InstaNY100K dataset**, the citation is:
   > Luis Lucas, David Tomás, and Jose Garcia-Rodriguez. *Exploiting the relationship between visual and textual features in social networks for image classification with zero-shot deep learning*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [pages], [year]. [Note: The exact conference name, pages, and year need to be filled in based on the actual publication details.]

2. For the **Places dataset**, the citation is:
   > Bolei Zhou, Agata Lapedriza, Jianxiong Xiao, Antonio Torralba, and Aude Oliva. *Learning Deep Features for Scene Recognition using Places Database - Supplementary Materials*. NIPS’14 Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, 1:487–495, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
