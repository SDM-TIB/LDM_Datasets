To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cascaded multi-scale and multi-dimension convolutional neural network for stereo matching" by Haihua Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on the **KITTI benchmark**, which suggests that this dataset is relevant.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experimental results section**. The authors explicitly state that they evaluated their model on the **KITTI 2012** and **KITTI 2015** datasets. I will gather details about these datasets, including their characteristics and any relevant information provided in the paper.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors provide a brief description of the datasets:
- **KITTI 2012**: Contains 194 training and 195 testing images, with ground truths obtained from LIDAR data.
- **KITTI 2015**: Consists of 200 training and 200 testing images, also with ground truths from LIDAR data.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the KITTI datasets are as follows:

- For **KITTI 2012**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3354-3361, 2012.

- For **KITTI 2015**, the citation is:
  > Matthias Menze and Andreas Geiger. *Object scene flow for autonomous vehicles*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3061-3070, 2015.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
