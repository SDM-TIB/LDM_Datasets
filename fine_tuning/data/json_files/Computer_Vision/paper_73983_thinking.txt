To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fuzzy Convolution Neural Networks for Tabular Data Classification" by Arun D. Kulkarni, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors generated **six complex noisy datasets** for validation, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the author describes the datasets used. In this section, the author lists the six datasets as follows:

1. **Half Kernel**: A dataset used for classification tasks, consisting of two attributes and 400 samples.
2. **Two Spirals**: Another dataset with two attributes and 400 samples, also used for classification.
3. **Clusters in Cluster**: This dataset contains two attributes and 400 samples, utilized for classification.
4. **Crescent Moon**: Similar to the others, this dataset has two attributes and 400 samples.
5. **Corners**: This dataset is unique as it contains samples from four classes, with 400 samples in total.
6. **Outliers**: This dataset consists of 200 samples from four classes, also with overlapping samples in the feature space.

The author mentions that these datasets were generated using a MATLAB script, which is an important detail for understanding the source of the data.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to these datasets. However, it appears that the datasets are generated by the author and do not have external citations. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are original contributions of the author.

I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the context in which they were used and the fact that they were generated by the author. The full citation for the paper itself will also be included for reference.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with the citation for the paper.

The citation for the paper is:
> Arun D. Kulkarni. *Fuzzy Convolution Neural Networks for Tabular Data Classification*. IEEE Access, 2024. doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2024.Doi Number.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entries based on this information.
