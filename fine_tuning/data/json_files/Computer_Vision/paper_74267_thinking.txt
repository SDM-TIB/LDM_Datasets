To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DiffPop: Plausibility-Guided Object Placement Diffusion for Image Composition" by Jiacheng Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of the **Cityscapes-OP dataset** and the **OPA dataset**, indicating that these are key datasets for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **results section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **Cityscapes-OP Dataset**: This dataset is constructed from composite images generated using the Cityscapes dataset. It includes 12,000 composite images (3,869 positive and 8,131 negative) for training and 1,000 composite images (395 positive and 605 negative) for testing. The dataset focuses on object placement tasks and provides human-annotated plausibility labels.

2. **OPA Dataset**: The OPA dataset is specifically designed for assessing object placement, containing 62,074 composite images (21,376 positive and 40,698 negative) for training and 11,396 composite images (3,588 positive and 7,808 negative) for testing. Each image is annotated with positive/negative rationality labels indicating whether the object placement is plausible.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Cityscapes dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cordts, M., Omran, M., Ramos, S., Rehfeld, T., Enzweiler, M., Benenson, R., Franke, U., Roth, S., & Schiele, B. (2016). The Cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 3213â€“3223.

- For the **OPA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Liu, L., Liu, Z., Zhang, B., Liu, Q., Niu, L., & Zhang, L. (2021). OPA: Object placement assessment dataset. arXiv preprint arXiv:2107.01889.

With these citations in hand, I will ensure that each dataset entry is accurately documented with its respective citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that the full citations are included for each dataset.
