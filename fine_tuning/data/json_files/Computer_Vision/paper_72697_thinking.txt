To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scaling SNNs Trained Using Equilibrium Propagation to Convolutional Architectures" by Jiaqi Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on the **MNIST** and **FashionMNIST** datasets, which suggests these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **methods** and **experimental results sections**. In the methods section, the authors describe their approach to training spiking neural networks (SNNs) and mention that they conducted experiments on the **MNIST** and **FashionMNIST** datasets. This confirms that these datasets are indeed used in their experiments.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors provide performance metrics for their models on both datasets, including test errors for MNIST (0.97%) and FashionMNIST (8.89%). This further emphasizes the importance of these datasets in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The MNIST dataset is widely known, but I will ensure to provide a proper citation. The citation for the MNIST dataset is:

- **MNIST Dataset**:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

The FashionMNIST dataset is a more recent dataset, and its citation is:

- **FashionMNIST Dataset**:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. 2017. [https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for both datasets as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
