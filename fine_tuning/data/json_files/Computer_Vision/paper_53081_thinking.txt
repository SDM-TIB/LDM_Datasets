To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Massive MIMO Beam Management in Sub-6 GHz 5G NR" by Ryan M. Dreifuerst et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a "flexible dataset of channels generated from QuaDRiGa," which indicates that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **methodology section**. The authors describe how they use the QuaDRiGa framework to generate realistic wireless channels and process the data into an initial access scenario. This suggests that the dataset is derived from simulations rather than a publicly available dataset.

In the **simulation results section**, the authors mention generating "2000 new channel sets" for testing, which further confirms the use of a dataset for their experiments. However, they do not provide a specific name for the dataset beyond referencing QuaDRiGa.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the QuaDRiGa framework, as this is the source of the dataset used in the study. The relevant citation is:

- For **QuaDRiGa**:
  > S. Jaeckel, L. Raschkowski, K. Börner, and L. Thiele. *QuaDRiGa: A 3-D multi-cell channel model with time evolution for enabling virtual field trials*. IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, pp. 3242–3256, 2014.

Since the dataset is generated using the QuaDRiGa framework, I will document it as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: QuaDRiGa Channel Dataset
   - **Description**: A flexible dataset of channels generated from the QuaDRiGa framework, used for simulating realistic wireless environments in the context of massive MIMO beam management.
   - **Citation**: S. Jaeckel, L. Raschkowski, K. Börner, and L. Thiele. *QuaDRiGa: A 3-D multi-cell channel model with time evolution for enabling virtual field trials*. IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, pp. 3242–3256, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and citation as required.
