To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FPGA Implementation of Convolutional Neural Network for Real-Time Handwriting Recognition" by Shichen (Justin) Qiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the implementation of a handwriting recognition system and mentions using machine learning architectures, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Training Software)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for training the machine learning models. In this section, the authors mention using the **EMNIST dataset** for training their models. 

I will note the specific details provided about the dataset:
- The **EMNIST dataset** contains 425,600 images with labels, which is used for training the models. The authors specify that the dataset is an extension of MNIST for handwritten letters.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the EMNIST dataset. The relevant citation is:
> Cohen, G., Afshar, S., Tapson, J., & van Schaik, A. (2017). EMNIST: An extension of mnist to handwritten letters. arXiv.org. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1702.05373

Additionally, I will check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. In section 5.1 (Linear Classification Model), the authors mention that they used the **Keras EMNIST dataset**, which confirms the dataset's relevance for their experiments.

After reviewing the entire paper, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the EMNIST dataset. 

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the EMNIST dataset, ensuring that it is clearly documented and ready for any further processing or review.
