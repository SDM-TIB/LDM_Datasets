To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving ProtoNet for Few-Shot Video Object Recognition: Winner of ORBIT Challenge 2022" by Li Gu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present a solution for the ORBIT Few-Shot Video Object Recognition Challenge, which suggests that a specific dataset is involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the ORBIT dataset, stating that it captures high variations in real-world applications and is used for the challenge. This is a strong indication that the ORBIT dataset is central to their work.

Next, I will look at **section 4.1 (Dataset and implementation details)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the ORBIT dataset. They mention that it contains **3,822 videos of 486 objects collected by 67 users**, with clean videos (target objects in isolation) and clutter videos (target objects mixed with others). This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides specific details about its composition.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ORBIT dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **ORBIT dataset**:
  > Daniela Massiceti, Luisa Zintgraf, John Bronskill, Lida Theodorou, Matthew Tobias Harris, Edward Cutrell, Cecily Morrison, Katja Hofmann, and Simone Stumpf. *Orbit: A real-world few-shot dataset for teachable object recognition*. In IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, 2021.

Since the authors refer to the ORBIT dataset multiple times throughout the paper, I will ensure to include this citation in my dataset entry.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the ORBIT dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent work.
