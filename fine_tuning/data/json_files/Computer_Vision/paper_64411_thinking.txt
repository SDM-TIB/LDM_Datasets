To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detail Reinforcement Diffusion Model: Augmentation Fine-Grained Visual Categorization in Few-Shot Conditions" by Tianxu Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) and mention the need for large-scale annotated data. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point, so I will continue to the experiments section.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention three benchmark datasets:

1. **CUB-200-2011**: This dataset is used for fine-grained bird classification and contains 200 bird species with a total of 11,788 images. The authors state that they follow the data split as described in the reference.

2. **Stanford Dogs**: This dataset consists of 120 breeds of dogs with a total of 20,580 images. The authors mention that they adhere to the same data split as in the reference.

3. **Stanford Cars**: This dataset includes 196 classes of cars with a total of 16,185 images. The authors also follow the data split as described in the reference.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CUB-200-2011**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*. California Institute of Technology.

- For **Stanford Dogs**, the citation is:
  > Khosla, A., Jayadevaprakash, N., Yao, B., & Li, F.-F. (2011). *Novel dataset for fine-grained image categorization: Stanford dogs*. In Proceedings of the CVPR workshop on fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC), 2(1).

- For **Stanford Cars**, the citation is:
  > Krause, J., Stark, M., Deng, J., & Fei-Fei, L. (2013). *3D object representations for fine-grained categorization*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops, 554-561.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its citation for proper attribution.
