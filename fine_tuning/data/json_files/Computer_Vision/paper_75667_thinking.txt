To extract datasets from the research paper titled "F-HOI: Toward Fine-grained Semantic-Aligned 3D Human-Object Interactions" by Jie Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new dataset called **Semantic-HOI**, which is a strong indication that this is a key dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the **Semantic-HOI** dataset. They describe it as comprising over 20,000 paired HOI states with fine-grained descriptions. This section will likely contain the specifics I need for the dataset entry.

In **section 3.2 (Data Collection)**, the authors explain that the **Semantic-HOI** dataset is constructed from three existing datasets: **GRAB**, **CHAIRS**, and **BEHAVE**. They provide statistics on the number of samples collected from each of these datasets, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's composition.

I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Semantic-HOI**: A new dataset introduced in this paper, containing over 20,441 paired HOI states with detailed descriptions and body movements between states.

2. **GRAB Dataset**: One of the datasets used to construct Semantic-HOI, which focuses on whole-body human grasping of objects.

3. **CHAIRS Dataset**: Another dataset contributing to Semantic-HOI, which features interactions primarily with chairs.

4. **BEHAVE Dataset**: The third dataset used to create Semantic-HOI, which includes various human-object interactions.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **GRAB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Taheri, O., Ghorbani, N., Black, M.J., Tzionas, D. *Grab: A dataset of whole-body human grasping of objects*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2020.

- For **CHAIRS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bhatnagar, B.L., Xie, X., Petrov, I.A., Sminchisescu, C., Theobalt, C., Pons-Moll, G. *Behave: Dataset and method for tracking human object interactions*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2022.

- For **BEHAVE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chen, Y., Huang, S., Yuan, T., Qi, S., Zhu, Y., Zhu, S.C. *Holistic++ scene understanding: Single-view 3D holistic scene parsing and human pose estimation with human-object interaction and physical commonsense*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
