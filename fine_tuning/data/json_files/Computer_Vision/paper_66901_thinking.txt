To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SnapFusion: Text-to-Image Diffusion Model on Mobile Devices within Two Seconds" by Yanyu Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on **MS-COCO**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in their research. The introduction may provide additional context or mention other datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant subsections within the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments on **MS-COCO**, which is a well-known dataset for image captioning and generation tasks. I will note the details provided about this dataset, such as its size, structure, and any specific splits used in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors may provide quantitative results that reference the datasets used, which can help confirm the datasets' relevance and importance in their research. I will ensure to note any specific configurations or versions of the datasets mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. For **MS-COCO**, the citation is as follows:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V 13, pages 740–755. Springer, 2014.

If there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper, I will follow the same process to extract their details and citations.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, ensuring that each dataset is described clearly and that the full citations are included for reference. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all necessary details accurately.
