To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bridging the ELBO and MMD" by Talip Uçar, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed model, µ-VAE, is trained on **MNIST** and **MNIST Fashion** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about the datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of training generative models and mentions the use of these datasets, but does not provide further specifics.

I will then look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the author describes the methodology and datasets used. Here, it is confirmed that the model is trained on both **MNIST** and **MNIST Fashion** datasets. The section provides insights into the training process and evaluation metrics, reinforcing the importance of these datasets in the study.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of the datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For the **Fashion MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zalando Research. *Fashion-MNIST: a Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. 2017. Available at: https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations to ensure clarity and completeness in the dataset extraction process.
