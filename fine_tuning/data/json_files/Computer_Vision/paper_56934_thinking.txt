To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion Models in Medical Imaging: A Comprehensive Survey," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on diffusion models in medical imaging, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly the sections that discuss applications of diffusion models. I will look for any specific datasets used in the studies referenced throughout the paper. The authors often cite various studies, and these citations may include datasets.

In the **applications section**, I will pay close attention to any subsections that detail specific tasks such as image segmentation, classification, or anomaly detection. Each of these tasks may reference different datasets used in the corresponding studies. For example, I will look for phrases like "we used the [dataset name] for this task" or "the experiments were conducted on the [dataset name]."

As I identify datasets, I will take note of their names, descriptions, and any relevant details provided in the text. For instance, if a dataset is mentioned in the context of a specific application, I will note the application and any metrics or results associated with that dataset.

Once I have compiled a list of datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper attribution is necessary for academic integrity. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if I find that the paper references the "BraTS dataset" for brain tumor segmentation, I will look for the original citation in the references to document it correctly.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will summarize each dataset, including its name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will ensure that the extracted information is clear and well-organized for future reference.

Finally, I will compile all the dataset entries into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and citation.
