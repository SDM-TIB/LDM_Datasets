To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion-Based Hierarchical Image Steganography" by Youmin Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental results sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method but may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup. This section may contain specific mentions of datasets used for training or testing their model. I will look for any phrases that indicate the use of datasets, such as "we used the DIV2K dataset for training" or similar statements.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors may provide performance metrics based on specific datasets. This section is crucial as it often includes detailed information about the datasets used, including their characteristics and any relevant citations.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. It is essential to ensure that I have the correct and complete citation for each dataset, as this will be important for proper attribution.

For example, if the paper mentions the **DIV2K dataset**, I would look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Eirikur Agustsson and Radu Timofte. *Ntire 2017 challenge on single image super-resolution: Dataset and study*. In CVPRW, 2017.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference or further processing, ensuring that all citations are complete and correctly formatted.
