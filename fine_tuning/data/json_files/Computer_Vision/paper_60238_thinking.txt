To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Instance-Aware Domain Generalization for Face Anti-Spoofing" by Qianyu Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention four public face anti-spoofing datasets:

1. **CASIA-MFSD**: This dataset is referenced as a widely-used benchmark for face anti-spoofing tasks.
2. **Idiap Replay-Attack**: Another dataset mentioned, known for its diverse attack types.
3. **MSU-MFSD**: This dataset is also included in their experiments, contributing to the evaluation of their method.
4. **OULU-NPU**: The authors note this dataset as part of their experimental setup, highlighting its real-world variations.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of these datasets. The citations I find are as follows:

- For **CASIA-MFSD**, the citation is:
  > Zhiwei Zhang, Junjie Yan, Sifei Liu, Zhen Lei, Dong Yi, and Stan Z Li. *A face antispoofing database with diverse attacks*. In 2012 5th IAPR International Conference on Biometrics (ICB), pages 26–31, 2012.

- For **Idiap Replay-Attack**, the citation is:
  > Ivana Chingovska, André Anjos, and Sébastien Marcel. *On the effectiveness of local binary patterns in face anti-spoofing*. In IEEE International Conference of Biometrics Special Interest Group, pages 1–7, 2012.

- For **MSU-MFSD**, the citation is:
  > Di Wen, Hu Han, Anil K Jain, et al. *Face spoof detection with image distortion analysis*. IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (TIFS), 10(4):746–761, 2015.

- For **OULU-NPU**, the citation is:
  > Zinelabinde Boulkenafet, Jukka Komulainen, Lei Li, Xiaoyi Feng, and Abdenour Hadid. *Oulu-npu: A mobile face presentation attack database with real-world variations*. In 12th IEEE international conference on automatic face & gesture recognition (FG), pages 612–618, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset, ensuring that I include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
