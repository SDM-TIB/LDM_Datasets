        "dcterms:description": "CamVid, short for Cambridge-driving Labeled Video Database, is a popular dataset used in computer vision and machine learning research. It consists of images captured from a vehicle driving through urban and suburban environments. The dataset is primarily used for semantic segmentation tasks, where the goal is to classify each pixel in an image or frame of a video into a specific object class, such as road, car, pedestrian, or building. CamVid is valuable for developing and testing algorithms related to autonomous driving, scene understanding, and image analysis.",
