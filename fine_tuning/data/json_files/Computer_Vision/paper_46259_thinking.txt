To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Weakly Supervised Arrhythmia Detection Based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network" by Yang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their models to the **AFDB** and **MITDB** datasets for testing their methods, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, they mention:

1. **MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database (AFDB)**: This dataset is used for detecting atrial fibrillation. The authors describe how they split the recordings into segments for model training and testing.

2. **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (MITDB)**: This dataset is utilized for detecting morphological arrhythmias. The authors specify that the rhythm type of each heartbeat in this database is annotated by cardiologists.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database (AFDB)**, the citation is:
  > Moody, G. B., & Mark, R. G. (1983). A New Method for Detecting Atrial Fibrillation Using RR Intervals. *Comput. Cardiol.*, pp. 227-230.

- For the **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (MITDB)**, the citation is:
  > Moody, G. B., & Mark, R. G. (2001). The impact of the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. *IEEE Eng. Med. Biol. Mag.*, 20(3), 45-50.

Having gathered this information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will allow for proper referencing and acknowledgment of the datasets used in the research.
