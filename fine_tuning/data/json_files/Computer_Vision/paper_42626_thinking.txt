To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UPR: A Model-Driven Architecture for Deep Phase Retrieval" by Naveed Naimipour et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and numerical results for more details.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention various methodologies and algorithms related to phase retrieval but do not explicitly name any datasets. This suggests that I may need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **numerical results section**. Here, the authors describe their experiments and mention that they trained their UPR architecture on a small training dataset of size B = 64, generated from random vectors. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset, which indicates it may be a synthetic dataset created for the purpose of their experiments.

Since the paper does not reference any publicly available datasets or provide full citations for any datasets, I will note that the dataset used is a synthetic one, generated from the data acquisition model described in the paper. The authors mention that the training points are generated from known vectors, but again, no specific dataset name is provided.

Finally, I will summarize my findings:
1. **Synthetic Dataset**: The authors used a synthetic dataset generated from random vectors for training their model. However, there is no formal citation or reference to an established dataset.

Since there are no specific datasets with citations to extract from this paper, I will conclude that the primary dataset used is synthetic and not formally cited. This highlights the importance of clearly naming and citing datasets in research papers for reproducibility and transparency.

In summary, I will document the findings regarding the dataset used in the paper, noting the lack of formal citations for any datasets.
