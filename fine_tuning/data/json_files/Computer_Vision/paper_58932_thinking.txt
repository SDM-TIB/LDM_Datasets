To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DuEqNet: Dual-Equivariance Network in Outdoor 3D Object Detection for Autonomous Driving" by Xihao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on the **nuScenes dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors explicitly state that all experiments were conducted on the **nuScenes dataset**. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of key frames, training samples, validation samples, and the categories of labeled objects. This section confirms that the nuScenes dataset is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the nuScenes dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- **nuScenes dataset**: 
  > H. Caesar, V. Bankiti, A. H. Lang, S. Vora, V. E. Liong, Q. Xu, A. Krishnan, Y. Pan, G. Baldan, and O. Beijbom. *nuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, 2020, pp. 11 621â€“11 631.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **nuScenes Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for 3D object detection tasks in the context of autonomous driving. It contains 40,000 key frames collected from various scene locations, with 28,130 training samples and 6,019 validation samples across 23 categories of labeled objects.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entry for the nuScenes dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details about the dataset used in the research paper.
