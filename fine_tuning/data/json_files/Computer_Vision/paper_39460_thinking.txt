To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reducing Noise in GAN Training with Variance Reduced Extragradient" by Tatjana Chavdarova et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors empirically tested their method on "standard datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention the datasets they utilized. I will look for any subsections that might be titled "Datasets" or similar, as these often contain the relevant information.

Upon reviewing the experiments section, I find that the authors used the following datasets:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits, commonly used for training various image processing systems.
2. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
3. **SVHN (Street View House Numbers)**: A real-world image dataset for digit recognition, consisting of over 600,000 labeled digits.
4. **ImageNet ILSVRC 2012**: A large visual database designed for use in visual object recognition software research, containing over 1 million images.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper documentation and should include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **MNIST**:
  > Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 2010. URL: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

- **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Master’s thesis, 2009. URL: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

- **SVHN**:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. 2011. URL: http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/.

- **ImageNet ILSVRC 2012**:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, and others. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211–252, 2015. URL: https://www.image-net.org/.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
