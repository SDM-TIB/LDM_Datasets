To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Dual Adversarial Learning for Anomaly Detection in Colonoscopy Video Frames" by Yuyuan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors introduce a new system for detecting frames containing polyps, which suggests that a dataset is involved, particularly one that includes images of colonoscopy frames.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for more context. Here, the authors discuss the challenges of obtaining annotated datasets for polyp detection, which reinforces the idea that they are working with a specific dataset for their experiments.

The **methods section** (specifically section 3) is crucial as it provides detailed information about the dataset used. The authors describe the dataset as being obtained from 18 colonoscopy videos from 15 patients, with specific details about the training, validation, and testing splits. They mention:

1. **Training set**: 13,250 normal (healthy) images without polyps.
2. **Validation set**: 100 normal (healthy) images for model selection.
3. **Testing set**: 967 images, including 290 abnormal images with polyps and 677 normal images.

This section gives me the necessary breakdown of the dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the authors do not provide a specific external dataset citation, as they describe a dataset they created from their own video recordings. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is original to this study and does not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information clearly, ensuring to highlight that the dataset is original and created for the purpose of this research. I will also note the specific characteristics of the dataset, including the number of images and their classification.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset details into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
