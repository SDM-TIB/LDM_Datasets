To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stochastic Trajectory Prediction via Motion Indeterminacy Diffusion" by Tianpei Gu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the method is evaluated on "human trajectory prediction benchmarks including the Stanford Drone and ETH/UCY datasets." This indicates that these datasets are likely important for the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details. The introduction reiterates the importance of trajectory prediction and mentions the same datasets, confirming their relevance.

I will then look into the **experiments section** (specifically section 4.1) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD)**: This dataset is described as a well-established benchmark for human trajectory prediction in a bird's eye view, consisting of 20 scenes captured using a drone around a university campus.

2. **ETH/UCY Dataset**: This dataset group includes five different scenes (ETH & HOTEL from ETH and UNIV, ZARA1, & ZARA2 from UCY), reporting the positions of pedestrians in world coordinates.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide additional context about the datasets, including their characteristics and how they are used in the experiments. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' significance in the research.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Stanford Drone Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alexandre Robicquet, Amir Sadeghian, Alexandre Alahi, and Silvio Savarese. *Learning social etiquette: Human trajectory understanding in crowded scenes*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 549–565, 2016.

- For the **ETH/UCY Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alon Lerner, Yiorgos Chrysanthou, and Dani Lischinski. *Crowds by example*. In Computer Graphics Forum, volume 26, pages 655–664, 2007.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their significance in the context of the research paper.
