To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Unpooling Layer for Graph Generation" by Yinglong Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors provide extensive experimental evidence on synthetic and real data, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they describe the following datasets:

1. **Waxman Random Graph Dataset**: This dataset consists of 20,000 randomly generated Waxman graphs with 12 nodes each. The authors provide details about the node features and the criteria for selecting the largest connected subgraphs.

2. **Protein Dataset**: This dataset is based on the work of Guo et al. (2021) and contains 76,000 graphs, each with 8 nodes. The node features are the 3D coordinate vectors of the proteins.

3. **QM9 Dataset**: This dataset contains 130,000 molecules, each consisting of up to 9 heavy atoms. The authors specify the average number of nodes and edges in the generated graphs.

4. **ZINC Dataset**: This dataset includes approximately 250,000 molecules, with each molecule consisting of 11 to 36 heavy atoms. The authors provide details about the node and edge features used in the dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Waxman Random Graph Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Waxman, B. (1988). Routing of multipoint connections. *IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications*, 6(9), 1617–1622. doi:10.1109/49.12889.

- For the **Protein Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Guo, X., Du, Y., & Zhao, L. (2021). Deep generative models for spatial networks. In *Proceedings of the 27th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining* (pp. 505–515).

- For the **QM9 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ramakrishnan, R., Dral, P. O., Rupp, M., & Von Lilienfeld, O. A. (2014). Quantum chemistry structures and properties of 134 kilo molecules. *Scientific Data*, 1(1), 1–7.

- For the **ZINC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sterling, T., & Irwin, J. J. (2015). ZINC 15–ligand discovery for everyone. *Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling*, 55(11), 2324–2337.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
