To extract datasets from the research paper titled "W-Net: A Deep Model for Fully Unsupervised Image Segmentation" by Xide Xia and Brian Kulis, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their method on the **Berkeley Segmentation Data Set**, which suggests that this dataset is relevant.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors state that they trained their proposed W-Net on the **PASCAL VOC2012 dataset** and evaluated it using the **Berkeley Segmentation Database (BSDS300 and BSDS500)**. This confirms that these datasets are used in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **PASCAL VOC2012 dataset**, the citation is:
   > M. Everingham, L. Van Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2012 (VOC2012) Results*. http://www.pascal-network.org/challenges/VOC/voc2012/workshop/index.html.

2. For the **Berkeley Segmentation Database (BSDS300 and BSDS500)**, the citation is:
   > P. Arbelaez, M. Maire, C. Fowlkes, and J. Malik. *Contour detection and hierarchical image segmentation*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 33(5):898â€“916, 2011.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **PASCAL VOC2012**: A large visual object classes challenge dataset containing 11,530 images and 6,929 segmentations.
- **Berkeley Segmentation Database (BSDS300 and BSDS500)**: A dataset providing human-annotated segmentation as ground truth, with 300 and 500 images respectively.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
