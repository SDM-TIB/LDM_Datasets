To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DataVinci: Learning Syntactic and Semantic String Repairs" by Mukul Singh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that DataVinci is evaluated on "4 existing and new benchmarks," which indicates that there are datasets involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments** section, particularly focusing on any subsections that discuss datasets or benchmarks used for evaluation. In this section, the authors explicitly list the datasets they used:

1. **Wikipedia Tables**: This dataset consists of 1000 tables that were manually annotated for error detection and repair performance evaluation.

2. **Excel Dataset**: This dataset includes 200 tables sampled from a corpus of 1.8 million publicly available Excel workbooks, also manually annotated.

3. **Synthetic Errors Dataset**: This dataset is composed of 1000 Excel tables from the same corpus, where synthetic errors were introduced to measure recall.

4. **Excel Formulas Dataset**: This dataset contains 11,000 formulas along with their input columns, designed to evaluate the impact of execution-guided repairs.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. However, since these datasets are likely created or compiled by the authors themselves, they may not have traditional citations like published datasets. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper.

The citations for the datasets will be structured as follows:

- For **Wikipedia Tables**:
  > Mukul Singh et al. "DataVinci: Learning Syntactic and Semantic String Repairs." PVLDB, 14(1): XXX-XXX, 2020. (Dataset of 1000 manually annotated tables)

- For **Excel Dataset**:
  > Mukul Singh et al. "DataVinci: Learning Syntactic and Semantic String Repairs." PVLDB, 14(1): XXX-XXX, 2020. (Dataset of 200 tables from 1.8 million Excel workbooks)

- For **Synthetic Errors Dataset**:
  > Mukul Singh et al. "DataVinci: Learning Syntactic and Semantic String Repairs." PVLDB, 14(1): XXX-XXX, 2020. (Dataset of 1000 Excel tables with synthetic errors)

- For **Excel Formulas Dataset**:
  > Mukul Singh et al. "DataVinci: Learning Syntactic and Semantic String Repairs." PVLDB, 14(1): XXX-XXX, 2020. (Dataset of 11,000 formulas and their input columns)

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the corresponding citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while providing proper citations for future reference.
