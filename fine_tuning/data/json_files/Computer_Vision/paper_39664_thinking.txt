To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpret Federated Learning with Shapley Values" by Guan Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the research focus but may not specify datasets. The introduction may contain references to datasets used in the experiments or examples relevant to the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the author describes the methodology and datasets used for testing the proposed Shap Federated algorithm. Here, I find that the author explicitly mentions the **Standard Adult Census Income dataset** as the dataset used for their experiments.

I will extract the details about this dataset, which includes the purpose of the dataset (predicting whether an individual's income exceeds $50K/year based on census data), the number of instances (26,048), and the number of attributes (12). This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and relevance to the research.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the Standard Adult Census Income dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For the **Standard Adult Census Income dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ron Kohavi. "Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: a Decision-Tree Hybrid". In Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 1996.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and its citation clearly. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as it is critical for proper attribution and academic integrity. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all necessary details regarding the dataset used in the research paper.
