To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unified Source-Free Domain Adaptation" by Song Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a unified problem in Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) and hints at the use of datasets for experiments, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their method on three specific datasets:

1. **Office-Home Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 15,000 images across 65 categories from various domains, including Artistic images, Clip Art, Product images, and Real-world images.

2. **VisDA Dataset**: This is a large-scale dataset consisting of 152,000 synthetic images in the source domain and 55,000 real object images in the target domain, used for domain adaptation tasks.

3. **DomainNet-126 Dataset**: A subset of the DomainNet dataset, it includes 600,000 images across 345 classes from 6 different domains, specifically focusing on 126 classes.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Office-Home Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Venkateswara, H., Eusebio, J., Chakraborty, S., & Panchanathan, S. (2017). *Deep hashing network for unsupervised domain adaptation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017, pp. 5385–5394.

- For the **VisDA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Peng, X., Usman, B., Kaushik, N., Hoffman, J., Wang, D., & Saenko, K. (2017). *VisDA: The visual domain adaptation challenge*. arXiv:1710.06924.

- For the **DomainNet-126 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Peng, X., Bai, Q., Xia, X., Huang, Z., Saenko, K., & Wang, B. (2019). *Moment matching for multi-source domain adaptation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 1406–1415.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
