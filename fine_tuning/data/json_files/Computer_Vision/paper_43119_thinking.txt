To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Training End-to-end Single Image Generators without GANs" by Yael Vinker, Nir Zabari, and Yedid Hoshen, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses a novel approach for training single image generative models but does not specify any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 5)**, as this is where datasets are typically discussed in detail. In this section, the authors mention two specific tasks: **Paint2Image** and **Edges2Image**. I will look for any references to datasets used for these tasks.

Upon reviewing the experiments, I find that the authors describe the **Edges2Image** task as being trained on a pair of edges and images, but they do not specify a particular dataset name. They mention that the edge image can be obtained using a manual sketch or an automatic edge detector, indicating that they may not rely on a standard dataset for this task.

For the **Paint2Image** task, the authors state that they train their upscaling network without the VAE front-end, but again, they do not mention a specific dataset. This suggests that they may be using custom or proprietary images rather than publicly available datasets.

Since the paper does not provide explicit names of datasets, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited that could be relevant to the tasks discussed. However, the references primarily consist of works related to generative models and do not point to specific datasets.

Given this analysis, it appears that the paper does not utilize standard datasets but rather focuses on tasks that can be performed with single images or pairs of images. Therefore, I will summarize my findings as follows:

1. **Edges2Image**: The task involves training on a pair of edges and images, but no specific dataset is mentioned.
2. **Paint2Image**: Similar to Edges2Image, this task does not reference a specific dataset.

Since no formal datasets are cited in the paper, I will note that the authors may have used custom images for their experiments. 

In conclusion, I will document my findings, emphasizing that the paper does not provide specific dataset names or citations, which is crucial for dataset extraction. If I were to create a structured output, I would indicate that no datasets were explicitly mentioned in the paper.
