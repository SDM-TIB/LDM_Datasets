To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Permutohedral Lattice CNNs" by Martin Kiefel, Varun Jampani, and Peter V. Gehler, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments that follow. The introduction often discusses the motivation and background, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, the authors mention two specific datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is widely known for handwritten digit recognition and consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of size 28x28 pixels.

2. **BSDS500 Dataset**: This dataset is used for image segmentation and contains 500 images with ground truth segmentations, which are often used for evaluating denoising algorithms.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers who may want to access these datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, November 1998.

- For the **BSDS500 Dataset**:
  > Pablo Arbelez, Michael Maire, Charless Fowlkes, and Jitendra Malik. *Contour detection and hierarchical image segmentation*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 33(5):898–916, May 2011.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
