To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning and Adaptation for Millimeter-Wave Beam Tracking and Training: a Dual Timescale Variational Framework" by Muddassar Hussain and Nicol√≤ Michelusi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a learning framework for beam dynamics but does not explicitly mention datasets. However, I will look for any references to datasets in the introduction or methodology.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** where datasets are typically described. I will look for any specific datasets used for numerical evaluations or simulations. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details such as the number of samples, features, or specific characteristics.

If the paper includes a **results section**, I will examine it for any references to datasets used in the experiments. This section often provides insights into how the datasets were utilized and their impact on the results.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its full citation in the references. If the dataset is not directly cited, I will search for authoritative sources or papers that describe the dataset to ensure I provide accurate citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will format the dataset information according to the required structure, ready for further processing or review.
