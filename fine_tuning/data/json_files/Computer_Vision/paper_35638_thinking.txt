To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Global versus Localized Generative Adversarial Nets" by Guo-Jun Qi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, which can help identify them.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments in section 5, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used. I will focus on this section to identify any datasets explicitly mentioned.

In section 5.3, the authors mention two datasets used for semi-supervised classification tasks:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images across ten categories. It is a well-known benchmark in the field of machine learning.

2. **SVHN Dataset**: The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset consists of 73,257 training images and 26,032 test images of house numbers. This dataset is also widely used for evaluating machine learning models.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **SVHN Dataset**:
  > Y. Netzer, T. Wang, A. Coates, A. Bissacco, B. Wu, and A. Y. Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. 2011.

Finally, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I have accurately captured all relevant details for future reference or processing.
