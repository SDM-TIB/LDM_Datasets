To extract datasets from the research paper titled "T4DT: Tensorizing Time for Learning Temporal 3D Visual Data" by Mikhail Usvyatsov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "3D scenes from the CAPE dataset" and "Articulated Mesh Animation dataset," which indicates that these datasets are relevant to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **Results section** where the authors describe their experiments. They specifically mention using the CAPE dataset and the Articulated Mesh Animation dataset for their evaluations. This confirms that these datasets are integral to their research.

In the **Results section**, the authors provide details about the CAPE dataset, stating it consists of 3D meshes of 15 clothed people in motion. They also mention that for each scene frame, they compute its Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) and discretize it at a resolution of 512³. This gives me a clear understanding of the dataset's characteristics.

For the **Articulated Mesh Animation dataset**, the authors describe it as containing 10 mesh sequences depicting 3 different humans performing various actions. They also mention that they compute the TSDF for each scene frame at the same resolution of 512³.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **CAPE dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ma, Q., Yang, J., Ranjan, A., Pujades, S., Pons-Moll, G., Tang, S., and Black, M. J. (2020). *Learning to Dress 3D People in Generative Clothing*. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

2. For the **Articulated Mesh Animation dataset**, the citation is:
   > Vlasic, D., Baran, I., Matusik, W., and Popović, J. (2008). *Articulated Mesh Animation from Multi-View Silhouettes*. ACM SIGGRAPH 2008 papers.

Having gathered this information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
