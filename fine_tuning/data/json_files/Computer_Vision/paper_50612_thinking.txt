To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VQ-GNN: A Universal Framework to Scale-up Graph Neural Networks using Vector Quantization" by Mucong Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention datasets used for experiments. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6), as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as well as any text that describes their characteristics.

In the experiments section, I will find specific mentions of datasets. For instance, the authors may refer to datasets like **ogbn-arxiv**, **Reddit**, **PPI**, and **ogbl-collab**. I will note down the details provided for each dataset, including the number of nodes, edges, features, classes, and the specific tasks they are used for.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For example, if the paper mentions the **ogbn-arxiv** dataset, I will look for its citation in the references, which might include the authors, title, and publication details.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, along with their proper references.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
