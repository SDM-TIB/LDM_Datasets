To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automated shapeshifting for function recovery in damaged robots" by Sam Kriegman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a concise overview of the study, and I will look for any mention of datasets or experimental data used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to identify any datasets that may be referenced or described. The introduction often outlines the context and background of the research, which may include datasets used in previous studies or those that the current research builds upon.

In the **methods section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the experimental setup, including any datasets that were collected or utilized during the experiments. This section typically provides specifics on the data collection process, which is crucial for understanding the datasets' nature.

The **results section** may also contain references to datasets, especially if the authors present data visualizations or statistical analyses based on those datasets. I will pay close attention to any figures or tables that might summarize the datasets used.

Finally, I will check the **discussion section** for any reflections on the datasets, including their significance, limitations, or comparisons to other datasets in the field.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is critical for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For this paper, I will specifically look for any datasets related to the robot's performance metrics, damage scenarios, or recovery strategies, as these are likely to be central to the research findings.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes a clear description of the dataset along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research and their relevance to the study's conclusions.
