To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Perceptual Quality Assessment Exploration for AIGC Images" by Zicheng Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the creation of a perceptual AGI quality assessment database called **AGIQA-1K**, which consists of 1,080 AGIs generated from diffusion models. This indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **database construction section** (II) where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they explain that the **AGIQA-1K** database is constructed using two latent text-to-image diffusion models, specifically **stable-inpainting-v1** and **stable-diffusion-v2**. The dataset comprises 1,080 AGIs generated from popular text keywords.

Additionally, I will check the **experiments section** to confirm the use of the **AGIQA-1K** dataset in their evaluations. The authors mention conducting a subjective experiment to collect quality labels for the AGIs, which further validates the dataset's significance in their research.

Now, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the **KonIQ-10k IQA database** for comparison purposes, which is another dataset that needs to be documented.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to gather full citations for both datasets:

1. For the **AGIQA-1K dataset**, since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:
   > Zicheng Zhang, Chunyi Li, Wei Sun, Xiaohong Liu, Xiongkuo Min, and Guangtao Zhai. *A Perceptual Quality Assessment Exploration for AIGC Images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP), 2023.

2. For the **KonIQ-10k IQA database**, the citation is:
   > Vlad Hosu, Hanhe Lin, Tamas Sziranyi, and Dietmar Saupe. *Koniq-10k: An ecologically valid database for deep learning of blind image quality assessment*. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 2020.

After gathering all necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will prepare the information for structured output or further analysis.
