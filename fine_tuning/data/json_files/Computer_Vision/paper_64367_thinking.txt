To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-step prediction of chlorophyll concentration based on Adaptive Graph-Temporal Convolutional Network with Series Decomposition" by Ying Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the model's validity is verified using water quality data from Beihai, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Methods)**, specifically **subsection 3.1 (Data sources)**, where the authors describe the experimental data. They mention that the data is collected from the coastal waters of Beihai, Guangxi Province, from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2022. This section provides essential details about the dataset, including the type of data collected (water quality parameters) and the duration of the data collection.

In this section, the authors also describe the equipment used for data collection, specifically the EM700 buoy and the YSI-6600 multi-parameter water quality analyzer. They list the parameters measured, including temperature, conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and chlorophyll concentration. This information is vital for understanding the dataset's scope.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from the authors' own data collection efforts rather than a publicly available dataset, there may not be a formal citation. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Water Quality Data from Beihai Coastal Waters
   - **Description**: This dataset includes measurements of various water quality parameters collected from the coastal waters of Beihai, Guangxi Province, from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2022. Parameters measured include temperature, salinity, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and chlorophyll concentration.
   - **Citation**: Not applicable (data collected by the authors).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and its significance in the context of the research.
