To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BSODA: A Bipartite Scalable Framework for Online Disease Diagnosis" by Weijie He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method on several public datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they provide a summary table (Table 2) that lists essential characteristics of the experimental datasets, including their types, sizes, and the number of diseases and symptoms.

From Table 2, I identify the following datasets:

1. **SymCAT**: A synthetic dataset used for training and testing, with no specific citation provided in the table. However, the paper references it as a symptom-disease database from AHEAD Research Inc. (2017).

2. **MuZhi**: A real-world dataset constructed from dialogue data from a pediatric department, with a citation to Wei et al. (2018).

3. **Dxy**: Another real-world dataset from a Chinese online healthcare website, also cited from Wei et al. (2018).

4. **HPO-Synthetic**: A synthetic dataset created using the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms, which does not have a specific citation but is derived from the HPO database.

5. **HPO-HMS**: A real-world dataset collected from health records, with a citation to Knitza et al. (2019).

6. **HPO-MME**: Another real-world dataset derived from the Matchmaker Exchange API, which also does not have a specific citation but is related to the HPO.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **SymCAT**, the citation is:
  > AHEAD Research Inc. 2017. SymCAT: Symptom-based, computer assisted triage. http://www.symcat.com.

- For **MuZhi**, the citation is:
  > Zhongyu Wei, Qianlong Liu, Baolin Peng, Huaixiao Tou, Ting Chen, Xuan-Jing Huang, Kam-Fai Wong, and Xiang Dai. 2018. Task-oriented dialogue system for automatic diagnosis. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers). 201–207.

- For **Dxy**, the citation is:
  > Zhongyu Wei, Qianlong Liu, Baolin Peng, Huaixiao Tou, Ting Chen, Xuan-Jing Huang, Kam-Fai Wong, and Xiang Dai. 2018. Task-oriented dialogue system for automatic diagnosis. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers). 201–207.

- For **HPO-Synthetic**, the citation is not explicitly provided, but it is based on the HPO database.

- For **HPO-HMS**, the citation is:
  > Johannes Knitza, Koray Tascilar, Eva-Maria Messner, Marco Meyer, Diana Vossen, Almut Pulla, Philipp Bosch, Julia Kittler, Arnd Kleyer, Philipp Sewerin, et al. 2019. German mobile apps in rheumatology: review and analysis using the mobile application rating scale (MARS). JMIR mHealth and uHealth 7, 8 (2019), e14991.

- For **HPO-MME**, the citation is not explicitly provided, but it is related to the Matchmaker Exchange API.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or citations related to the datasets used in the research paper.
