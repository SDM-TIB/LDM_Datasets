To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comprehensive Empirical Study of Vision-Language Pre-trained Model for Supervised Cross-Modal Retrieval" by Zhixiong Zeng and Wenji Mao, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on several benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **Wikipedia Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,157 image-text pairs from 10 semantic classes for training and 462 image-text pairs for testing.

2. **Pascal-Sentence Dataset**: This dataset includes 800 image-text pairs from 20 classes for training and 200 image-text pairs for testing.

3. **NUS-WIDE Dataset**: This dataset contains 8,000 image-text pairs from 10 classes for training and 1,000 image-text pairs for testing.

4. **XmediaNet Dataset**: This dataset comprises 32,000 image-text pairs from 200 classes for training and 4,000 image-text pairs for testing.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Wikipedia Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Pascal-Sentence Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **NUS-WIDE Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **XmediaNet Dataset**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
