To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantifying Community Characteristics of Maternal Mortality Using Social Media" by Rediet Abebe et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors analyze pregnancy-related tweets and their relationship to maternal mortality rates, suggesting that there are datasets derived from social media.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their study. Here, they mention three main datasets:

1. **Pregnancy-Related Tweets**: This dataset consists of tweets related to pregnancy and birth, filtered using specific seed-words. The authors detail the process of selecting and validating these tweets, which indicates the dataset's relevance and size.

2. **U.S. County Tweets**: This dataset includes tweets that are geo-located to U.S. counties, derived from the County Tweet Lexical Bank. The authors explain how they filtered the data to ensure it only includes relevant tweets from users with sufficient activity.

3. **Mortality Rates**: The authors collected maternal mortality data from the CDC WONDER online database, covering the years 2009-2017. They specify the criteria for the data collected, including the International Classification of Diseases categories used.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Twitter data**: The authors do not provide a formal citation for the Twitter dataset itself, as it is derived from a random sample of the Twitter stream. However, they reference the County Tweet Lexical Bank, which can be cited as:
  > Giorgi, S., Preotiuc-Pietro, D., Buffone, A., Rieman, D., Ungar, L. H., & Schwartz, H. A. (2018). The Remarkable Benefit of User-Level Aggregation for Lexical-based Population-Level Predictions. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing.

- For the **CDC WONDER data**: The citation is:
  > Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (2019). CDC Wonder. Retrieved from https://wonder.cdc.gov/.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
