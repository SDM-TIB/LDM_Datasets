To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Decomposition for Stochastic Normal-Abnormal Transport" by Peirong Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions the application of the model on a **brain perfusion dataset from ischemic stroke patients**, which indicates that there is at least one dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly in **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets utilized for their experiments. In this section, they mention two key datasets:

1. **2D/3D Anomaly-Encoded Advection-Diffusion Simulator**: This dataset is generated by the authors for the purpose of training their model. It includes simulated data with both normal and abnormal transport patterns, which is crucial for their experiments.

2. **ISLES2017 Dataset**: This dataset contains perfusion data from 75 ischemic stroke patients, which is used to validate the model's performance on real-world data. The authors provide details about the dataset, including the number of patients and the type of imaging used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **ISLES2017 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Oskar Maier, Bjoern H Menze, Janina von der Gablentz, Levin Hani, Mattias P Heinrich, Matthias Liebrand, Stefan Winzeck, Abdul Basit, Paul Bentley, Liang Chen, Daan Christiaens, Francis Dutil, Karl Egger, Chaolu Feng, Ben Glocker, Michael Götz, Tom Haeck, Hanna-Leena Halme, Mohammad Havaei, Khan M Iftekharuddin, Pierre-Marc Jodoin, Konstantinos Kamnitsas, Elias Kellner, Antti Korvenoja, Hugo Larochelle, Christian Ledig, Jia-Hong Lee, Frederik Maes, Qaiser Mahmood, Klaus H Maier-Hein, Richard McKinley, John Muschelli, Chris Pal, Linmin Pei, Janaki Raman Rangarajan, Syed M S Reza, David Robben, Daniel Rueckert, Eero Salli, Paul Suetens, Ching-Wei Wang, Matthias Wilms, Jan S Kirschke, Ulrike M Krämer, Thomas F Münte, Peter Schramm, Roland Wiest, Heinz Handels, and Mauricio Reyes. *ISLES 2015 - a public evaluation benchmark for ischemic stroke lesion segmentation from multispectral MRI medical image analysis*. Medical Image Analysis, 35, 2017.

The **2D/3D Anomaly-Encoded Advection-Diffusion Simulator** does not have a specific citation since it is a dataset created by the authors for their experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the datasets identified, particularly focusing on the ISLES2017 dataset as it is the only one with a formal citation in the references.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and structured output detailing the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
