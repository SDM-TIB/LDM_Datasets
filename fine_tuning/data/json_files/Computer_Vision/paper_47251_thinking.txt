To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data augmentation by morphological mixup for solving Raven’s Progressive Matrices" by Wentao He, Jianfeng Ren, and Ruibin Bai, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a data augmentation method and mention improvements on various RPM-like datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors evaluate their method. In **section 4 (Experimental results)**, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **RAVEN Dataset**: This dataset contains 70,000 samples, each consisting of a 3×3 image matrix with one missing image and eight candidate answers. The dataset is designed for relational and analogical visual reasoning tasks.

2. **I-RAVEN Dataset**: This is a variant of the RAVEN dataset, created to address certain defects in the original dataset. It also consists of similar configurations but with a more balanced candidate answer set.

In the **dataset description section (4.1)**, the authors provide detailed information about the RAVEN dataset, including its structure and the reasoning tasks it is designed for. They also describe the I-RAVEN dataset, highlighting its differences from the original RAVEN dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **RAVEN dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. Zhang, F. Gao, B. Jia, Y. Zhu, S.-C. Zhu. *RAVEN: A dataset for relational and analogical visual reasoning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 5317–5327, 2019.

- For the **I-RAVEN dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Hu, Y. Ma, X. Liu, Y. Wei, S. Bai. *Stratified Rule-Aware Network for Abstract Visual Reasoning*. In Proceedings of the 35th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), pages 1567–1574, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
