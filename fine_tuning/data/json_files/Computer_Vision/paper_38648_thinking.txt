To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scene Graph Reasoning with Prior Visual Relationship for Visual Question Answering" by Zhuoqian Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention demonstrating their model's effectiveness on the **GQA dataset** and the **VQA 2.0 dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **GQA Dataset**: This dataset is described as a new dataset for visual question answering over real-world images, emphasizing its strong language priors and the requirement for understanding visual relationships.

2. **VQA 2.0 Dataset**: This is a well-known benchmark for visual question answering that includes measures against guessing based solely on language priors.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **GQA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Drew A. Hudson and Christopher D. Manning. *GQA: A New Dataset for Compositional Question Answering over Real-World Images*. In arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.09506, 2017.

- For the **VQA 2.0 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Aishwarya Agrawal, Jiasen Lu, Stanislaw Antol, Margaret Mitchell, C. Lawrence Zitnick, Dhruv Batra, and Devi Parikh. *VQA: Visual Question Answering*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2425â€“2433, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. GQA Dataset
2. VQA 2.0 Dataset

I will ensure to include the full citations for both datasets as part of the final output.
