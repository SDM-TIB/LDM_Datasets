To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GraphDreamer: Compositional 3D Scene Synthesis from Scene Graphs" by Gege Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the use of scene graphs for generating 3D scenes, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide more context or references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their use in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets or their characteristics. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the **Visual Genome**, I would look for its citation in the references, which typically includes the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the extracted information is clear and well-organized, ready for any further processing or presentation.
