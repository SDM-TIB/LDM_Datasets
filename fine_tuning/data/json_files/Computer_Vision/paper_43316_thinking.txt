To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attentive Weakly Supervised Land Cover Mapping for Object-Based Satellite Image Time Series Data with Spatial Interpretation" by Dino Ienco et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of "two real-world scenarios over large study sites," which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets or descriptions that indicate the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section V), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were collected or processed.

In the experiments section, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Reunion Island Dataset**: This dataset consists of a time series of 21 Sentinel-2 images acquired between January and December 2017. The ground truth was built from various sources, including reference data and visual interpretation of high-resolution images.

2. **Koumbia Dataset**: This dataset consists of a time series of 23 Sentinel-2 images acquired between January and December 2016. The reference database includes digitized plots from a GPS field mission and additional reference plots obtained by photo-interpretation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

For the **Reunion Island Dataset**, the citation is:
> Dupuey, S., Gaetano, R., Mezo, L. L. (2020). Mapping land cover on Reunion Island in 2017 using satellite imagery and geospatial ground data. *Data in Brief*, 28, 104872.

For the **Koumbia Dataset**, the citation is:
> Ienco, D., Interdonato, R., Gaetano, R., Minh, D. H. T. (2019). Combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite image time series for land cover mapping via a multi-source deep learning architecture. *ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing*, 158, 11-22.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, characteristics, and full citation. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and accuracy in the extraction process.
