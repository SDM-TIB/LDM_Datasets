To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DriveGuard: Robustification of Automated Driving Systems with Deep Spatio-Temporal Convolutional Autoencoder" by Christos Kyrkou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on a diverse dataset created with real and synthetic images, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Methodology and Evaluation)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Cityscapes Dataset**: This dataset is used for real-life data training and evaluation, providing high-quality semantic segmentation annotations with 3900 training images and 880 test images, annotated at 20 frames per second from 50 different cities.

2. **CARLA Simulator Dataset**: This synthetic dataset is created using the CARLA simulator, which includes dynamic weather challenges. It consists of RGB image data and ground truth semantic segmentation maps collected from 5 different towns, with 1800 training images, 490 test images, and 450 validation images.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Cityscapes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

- For the **CARLA Simulator Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cory Cornelius, Shang-Tse Chen, Jason Martin, and Duen Horng Chau. *Talk Proposal: Towards the Realistic Evaluation of Evasion Attacks Using CARLA*. CoRR, abs/1904.12622, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
