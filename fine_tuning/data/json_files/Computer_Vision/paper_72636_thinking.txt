To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Animate Your Thoughts: Decoupled Reconstruction of Dynamic Natural Vision from Slow Brain Activity" by Yizhuo Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors achieve state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used. Here, they mention three publicly available video-fMRI datasets:

1. **CC2017 Dataset**: This dataset includes fMRI data from 3 subjects who viewed various movie clips. The authors provide details about the number of training and testing samples, as well as the temporal resolution of the fMRI data.

2. **HCP Dataset**: This dataset is part of the Human Connectome Project and includes BOLD responses from 158 subjects. The authors specify that they randomly selected three subjects for their experiments.

3. **Algonauts2021 Dataset**: This dataset was released for the 2021 Algonauts Challenge and includes fMRI data from 10 participants who viewed silent videos of everyday events.

In the **data acquisition section** (section C.5), the authors provide links to access these datasets, which will be useful for retrieving the full citations.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset from the references section:

- For the **CC2017 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Haiguang Wen, Junxing Shi, Yizhen Zhang, Kun-Han Lu, Jiayue Cao, and Zhongming Liu. *Neural encoding and decoding with deep learning for dynamic natural vision*. Cerebral Cortex, 28(12):4136â€“4160, 2018.

- For the **HCP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Daniel S Marcus, John Harwell, Timothy Olsen, Michael Hodge, Matthew F Glasser, Fred Prior, Mark Jenkinson, Timothy Laumann, Sandra W Curtiss, and David C Van Essen. *Informatics and data mining tools and strategies for the human connectome project*. Frontiers in neuroinformatics, 5:4, 2011.

- For the **Algonauts2021 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Radoslaw Martin Cichy, Kshitij Dwivedi, Benjamin Lahner, Alex Lascelles, Polina Iamshchinina, Monika Graumann, Alex Andonian, NAR Murty, K Kay, Gemma Roig, et al. *The algonauts project 2021 challenge: How the human brain makes sense of a world in motion*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2104.13714, 2021.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that each dataset is described accurately, including the number of participants, the nature of the data, and any relevant preprocessing steps mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for further processing or review.
