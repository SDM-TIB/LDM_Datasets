To extract datasets from the thesis titled "Applying Generative Adversarial Networks to Intelligent Subsurface Imaging and Identification" by William Rice, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the generation of realistic Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) data using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and indicates that the thesis focuses on augmenting training data for GPR data classification. This suggests that there may be datasets related to GPR data collection.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** section, particularly the part where the author discusses generating training data with GprMax. Here, the author mentions that they generated a total of 150 A-scan traces to create B-scans, which are used as the primary dataset for training the GAN model. This indicates that the generated GPR data is a key dataset.

In the **results and discussion** section, the author discusses the performance of the GAN-generated data and its impact on object classification. The author also mentions that they collected real GPR data in collaboration with the University of Vermont, which adds another dataset to consider.

Now, I will compile the datasets identified:

1. **GPR Data Generated with GprMax**: This dataset consists of simulated GPR B-scans generated using the GprMax software, which simulates electromagnetic wave propagation. The author specifies that the dataset includes various dielectric properties and cylinder materials.

2. **Real GPR Data Collected**: This dataset includes real B-scan images collected by the author's team in collaboration with the University of Vermont. The author notes that around 20 images were collected during this process.

Next, I will look into the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The GprMax software is referenced, and I will include its citation as it is crucial for understanding the dataset generation process. The real GPR data collection may not have a specific citation since it is a collaboration, but I will note the collaboration with the University of Vermont.

The citations I will include are:

- For **GprMax**:
  > Warren, C., Giannopoulos, A., & Giannakis, I. (2016). GprMax: Open Source Software to Simulate Electromagnetic Wave Propagation for Ground Penetrating Radar. *Computer Physics Communications*, 209, 163-170. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2016.08.020.

- For the **real GPR data collection**:
  > Collaboration with the University of Vermont for GPR data collection (specific citation not available).

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference.
