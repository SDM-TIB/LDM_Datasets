To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Photo Cropper and Enhancer" by Aaron Ott et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a new dataset to train and test their method, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe their experimental methodology. Here, they mention two datasets: **DCE-1** and **DCE-2**. I will extract details about these datasets, including how they were collected and their intended use.

1. **DCE-1**: This dataset consists of photos taken of images displayed on a monitor, specifically using images from the Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 dataset. The authors note that they collected over 100 photos for DCE-1, which is split into training and testing subsets.

2. **DCE-2**: This dataset is designed to be more challenging than DCE-1, with photos taken from farther distances and with more complex backgrounds. It also includes images from categories other than birds, sourced from ImageNet. The authors indicate that DCE-2 is used for testing.

Additionally, the authors created a **synthetic dataset** called **DCE-S**, which combines random background images from the Places dataset with foreground images from the Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 dataset. This dataset was generated to simulate realistic scenarios for training.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For **Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 dataset**, the citation is:
  > P. Welinder, S. Branson, T. Mita, C. Wah, F. Schroff, S. Belongie, and P. Perona. *Caltech-UCSD Birds 200*. Tech. Rep. CNS-TR-2010-001, California Institute of Technology, 2010.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In CVPR, 2009.

- For **Places dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bolei Zhou, Agata Lapedriza, Aditya Khosla, Aude Oliva, and Antonio Torralba. *Places: A 10 million image database for scene recognition*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2017.

With these citations, I now have all the necessary information to describe each dataset in detail. I will compile the dataset entries accordingly, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for proper attribution.
