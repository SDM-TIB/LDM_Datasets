To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Response to Moﬀat’s Comment on 'Towards Meaningful Statements in IR Evaluation: Mapping Evaluation Measures to Interval Scales'" by Marco Ferrante et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract primarily discusses the authors' response to Moﬀat's comments and does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in their previous work.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss methodology or experiments. I will look for any specific datasets that the authors might have used to support their arguments or analyses. Since this paper is a response to a comment, it may not introduce new datasets but rather reference those from their original work.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited there. The authors may refer to datasets used in their previous papers, which could be relevant to the discussion in this response paper.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will ensure to note their names, descriptions, and the context in which they were used. I will also look for full citations for each dataset, as this is crucial for proper attribution.

For example, if the authors refer to datasets from their previous works, I will extract the relevant citations from the references section. I will ensure to format these citations correctly, following the style used in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and attributed to its original source.

Throughout this process, I will pay close attention to the details to ensure accuracy and completeness in the extraction of datasets and their citations.
