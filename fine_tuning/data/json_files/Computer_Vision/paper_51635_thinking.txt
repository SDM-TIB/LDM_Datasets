To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exemplar-free Class Incremental Learning via Discriminative and Comparable One-class Classifiers" by Wenju Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets they used:

1. **MNIST**: This dataset is described as containing 60,000 images of handwritten digits, each of size 28x28 pixels, and is divided into five incremental batches for the experiments.

2. **CIFAR10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 images from 10 classes, each image being 32x32 pixels. Similar to MNIST, it is also divided into five incremental batches.

3. **Tiny-ImageNet**: This is the largest dataset used in the experiments, containing 200 classes with 600 images per class. The authors mention that they split this dataset into ten incremental batches.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. 2010.

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. University of Toronto, 05 2012.

- For **Tiny-ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Stanford. *Tiny ImageNet Challenge (CS231n)*. 2015.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research paper for any further processing or review.
