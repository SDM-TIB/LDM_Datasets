To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the use of Vision-Language models for Visual Sentiment Analysis: a study on CLIP" by Cristina Bustos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors trained their models with **WEBEmo**, which is described as the largest publicly available and manually labeled benchmark for Visual Sentiment Analysis. This indicates that WEBEmo is a key dataset used in their study.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**, specifically **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **WEBEmo**: This dataset contains 268,000 images retrieved from the Internet, labeled with a hierarchical model of emotions. It is the primary dataset used for training their models.

2. **FI Dataset**: This dataset consists of 23,308 images from Flickr and Instagram, manually labeled on 8 emotion categories. It is used for cross-dataset evaluation.

3. **IAPS Dataset**: Comprising 1,282 images, this dataset is labeled with binary valence and is also used for cross-dataset evaluation.

4. **Emotion-6 Dataset**: This dataset contains 8,350 images labeled with 6 emotion categories and is used for cross-dataset evaluation.

5. **EmotionROI Dataset**: This dataset includes 1,980 images with binary valence labels and 6 category labels, also used for cross-dataset evaluation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The citations I will look for include:

- For **WEBEmo**, the citation is:
  > Panda, R., Zhang, J., Li, H., Lee, J.-Y., Lu, X., & Roy-Chowdhury, A. K. (2018). Contemplating visual emotions: Understanding and overcoming dataset bias. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

- For **FI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > You, Q., Luo, J., Jin, H., & Yang, J. (2016). Building a large scale dataset for image emotion recognition: The fine print and the benchmark. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

- For **IAPS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lang, P. J., Bradley, M. M., & Cuthbert, B. N. (1997). International affective picture system (IAPS): Technical manual and affective ratings. NIMH Center for the Study of Emotion and Attention.

- For **Emotion-6 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Panda, R., Zhang, J., Li, H., Lee, J.-Y., Lu, X., & Roy-Chowdhury, A. K. (2018). Contemplating visual emotions: Understanding and overcoming dataset bias. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

- For **EmotionROI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Peng, K.-C., Sadovnik, A., Gallagher, A., & Chen, T. (2016). Where do emotions come from? Predicting the emotion stimuli map. In 2016 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP).

Once I have gathered all the necessary information and citations, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and ease of use in future references or analyses.
