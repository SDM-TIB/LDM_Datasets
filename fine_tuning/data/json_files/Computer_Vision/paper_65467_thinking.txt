To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Pre-Training Using Masked Autoencoders for ECG Analysis" by Guoxin Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted using various model architectures and large-scale datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the parts where the authors describe their experimental setup. In this section, they mention using the **PhysioNet / Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2021 (CINC2021)** for pre-training, which is a large-scale database comprising unlabelled ECG records. This is a key dataset for the study.

Then, I will look for details about the datasets used for fine-tuning and testing. The authors specifically mention the **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (MITDB)** and the **St Petersburg INCART 12-lead Arrhythmia Database (INCARTDB)**. They describe how the MITDB is divided into training and validation sets (MITDB-DS1 and MITDB-DS2), which is important for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section**:

1. For the **PhysioNet / Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2021 (CINC2021)**, the citation is:
   > Erick A. Perez Alday et al. *Classification of 12-lead ECGs: the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2020*. Physiol. Meas., 41(12):124003, December 2020.

2. For the **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (MITDB)**, the citation is:
   > George B. Moody and Roger G. Mark. *MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database*. https://doi.org/10.13026/C2F305, 1992.

3. For the **St Petersburg INCART 12-lead Arrhythmia Database (INCARTDB)**, the citation is:
   > V. Tihonenko, A. Khaustov, S. Ivanov, and A. Rivin. *St. Petersburg Institute of Cardiology 12-lead Arrhythmia Database*. https://doi.org/10.13026/C2V88N, 2007.

After compiling this information, I will summarize the datasets, ensuring to include their names, descriptions, and full citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further studies in the field of ECG analysis.
