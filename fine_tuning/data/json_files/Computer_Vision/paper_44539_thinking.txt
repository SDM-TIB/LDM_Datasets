To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LPMNet: Latent Part Modification and Generation for 3D Point Clouds" by Cihan Öngün and Alptekin Temizel, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, but the introduction and experimental sections are likely to contain more detailed information about the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of 3D models and point clouds, but I need to look for specific datasets. I will pay close attention to any references to datasets that support their experiments or findings.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Evaluation)**, where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention using the **ShapeNetPart dataset**, which is a reorganized annotated subset of the ShapeNet 3D dataset. This section provides details about the dataset, including the number of models, categories, and part labels.

The authors specify that the ShapeNetPart dataset contains part labels for over 16,000 models across 16 categories, with specific categories (chair, table, and plane) being used for their study. They also mention the number of samples for each category, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ShapeNetPart dataset. The citation is as follows:
- For **ShapeNetPart dataset**:
  > Yi, L., Kim, V. G., Ceylan, D., Shen, I. C., Yan, M., Su, H., et al. (2016). A scalable active framework for region annotation in 3D shape collections. *SIGGRAPH Asia*.

Additionally, the authors reference the original **ShapeNet dataset**:
- For **ShapeNet dataset**:
  > Chang, A. X., Funkhouser, T., Guibas, L., Hanrahan, P., Huang, Q., Li, Z., et al. (2015). ShapeNet: An Information-Rich 3D Model Repository. *Tech. Rep. arXiv:1512.03012*.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations for future reference.
