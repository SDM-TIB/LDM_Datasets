To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion Self-Organizing Map on the Hypersphere" by M. Andrecut, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the **MNIST dataset** to illustrate the proposed method, which indicates that this dataset is significant for the research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (MNIST dataset)**, where the author provides a detailed description of the MNIST dataset. The section states that the MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits, with each image being monochrome and sized 28x28 pixels. This confirms that the MNIST dataset is indeed used in the experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The paper cites the original work related to the MNIST dataset as follows:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. Lecun, L. Bottou, Y. Bengio, P. Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE 86(11), 2278 (1998). Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist.

Since the MNIST dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MNIST dataset, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and completeness.
