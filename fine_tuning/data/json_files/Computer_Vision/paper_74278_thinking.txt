To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A PRISMA Driven Systematic Review of Publicly Available Datasets for Benchmark and Model Developments for Industrial Defect Detection" by Can Akbas et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the review identifies 15 publicly available datasets, which suggests that there will be a list of datasets in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Results)**, where the authors summarize the datasets identified in their review. They mention several datasets, including:

1. **NEU-CLS**: This dataset is noted for its use in surface defect detection and classification, particularly in hot-rolled steel strips. It contains 1,800 grayscale images capturing six common surface defects.

2. **NEU-DET**: Similar to NEU-CLS, this dataset is also from Northeastern University and is used for defect detection.

3. **DAGM**: This dataset is highlighted for its artificial generation, which allows it to mimic real-world problems effectively.

4. **KolektorSDD**: This dataset contains images of defective production items captured in a controlled industrial environment.

5. **PCB Defect Dataset**: This dataset focuses on printed circuit board defects, which are critical in electronic manufacturing.

6. **Hollow Cylindrical Defect Detection Dataset**: This dataset addresses cylindrical surface defects.

In addition to these datasets, I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **discussion or conclusion sections**. The authors reference the **Severstal Steel Surface Defect Detection Dataset**, which is hosted on Kaggle, and other datasets like **COCO**, **Pascal VOC**, and **ModelNet40**, although these are not specifically for industrial defect detection.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned. Here are the citations I will extract:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
