To extract datasets from the research paper titled "What Has Been Enhanced in my Knowledge-Enhanced Language Model?" by Yifan Hou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of knowledge integration (KI) methods and references two knowledge-enhanced language models, ERNIE and K-Adapter, which suggests that datasets related to these models may be discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 6) where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for knowledge integration. Here, they specifically mention:

1. **T-REx-rc Dataset**: This dataset is used for knowledge integration in the K-Adapter model. The authors provide details about its alignment with knowledge triples in Wikidata.

2. **Wikidata**: This is another dataset mentioned in the context of the ERNIE model, which integrates knowledge from this knowledge graph.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper documentation:

- For the **T-REx-rc Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hady Elsahar, Pavlos Vougiouklis, Arslen Remaci, Christophe Gravier, Jonathon Hare, Frederique Laforest, and Elena Simperl. *T-REx: A large scale alignment of natural language with knowledge base triples*. In Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2018), Miyazaki, Japan. European Language Resources Association (ELRA), 2018.

- For **Wikidata**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation, it is generally referenced as:
  > Wikimedia Foundation. *Wikidata: A free collaborative knowledge base*. [https://www.wikidata.org](https://www.wikidata.org).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.
