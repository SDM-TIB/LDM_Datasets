To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Autoencoders with Deconvolutional Networks" by Jia Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is validated on several tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation. In this section, they mention using five graph classification benchmarks: **IMDB-BIN, IMDB-MULTI, REDDIT-BIN, PROTEINS, and DD**. I will note down these datasets and any relevant details provided about them.

I will also check the **social recommendation section** (5.2), where the authors mention using two datasets: **Douban and Ciao**. I will record these datasets as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution.

1. For the **IMDB-BIN** dataset, the citation is:
   > David I. Shuman, Sunil K. Narang, Pascal Frossard, Antonio Ortega, and Pierre Vandergheynst. *The emerging field of signal processing on graphs: Extending high-dimensional data analysis to networks and other irregular domains*. IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 30(3):83–98, 2013.

2. For the **IMDB-MULTI** dataset, the citation is:
   > Nils Kriege and Petra Mutzel. *Subgraph matching kernels for attributed graphs*. ICML, pp. 291–298, 2012.

3. For the **REDDIT-BIN** dataset, the citation is:
   > Petar Veličković, Guillem Cucurull, Arantxa Casanova, Adriana Romero, Pietro Lio, and Yoshua Bengio. *Graph attention networks*. ICLR, 2018.

4. For the **PROTEINS** dataset, the citation is:
   > Nils Kriege and Petra Mutzel. *Subgraph matching kernels for attributed graphs*. ICML, pp. 291–298, 2012.

5. For the **DD** dataset, the citation is:
   > David I. Shuman, Sunil K. Narang, Pascal Frossard, Antonio Ortega, and Pierre Vandergheynst. *The emerging field of signal processing on graphs: Extending high-dimensional data analysis to networks and other irregular domains*. IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 30(3):83–98, 2013.

6. For the **Douban** dataset, the citation is:
   > Mohsen Jamali and Martin Ester. *A matrix factorization technique with trust propagation for recommendation in social networks*. In RecSys, pp. 135–142, 2010.

7. For the **Ciao** dataset, the citation is:
   > Federico Monti, Michael Bronstein, and Xavier Bresson. *Geometric matrix completion with recurrent multi-graph neural networks*. In Neurips, pp. 3697–3707, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
