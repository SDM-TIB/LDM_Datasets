To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Outputs Is All You Need For Deblur" by Sidun Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their approach on multiple image-deblur models, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges of image deblurring and the need for effective datasets. They mention that the GoPro dataset is a commonly used benchmark for image deblurring, which is a strong indication that it will be detailed further in the paper.

In the **related work section**, the authors provide a brief overview of the GoPro dataset, describing it as containing synthetic blurry images generated from high frame rate videos. They also mention the HIDE dataset, which is specifically designed for human-aware image deblurring. This section provides essential context about the datasets used in their experiments.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will look for a dedicated subsection on datasets. Here, the authors explicitly state that they used the **GoPro dataset** for training and the **HIDE dataset** for validation. They provide details about the number of image pairs in each dataset, which is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **references section** of the paper:

1. **GoPro Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Nah, S., Kim, T. H., & Lee, K. M. (2017). Deep Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Network for Dynamic Scene Deblurring. In *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*, 2017, 1691-1700.

2. **HIDE Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Shen, Z., Wang, W., Lu, X., Shen, J., Ling, H., Xu, T., & Shao, L. (2019). Human-aware motion deblurring. In *Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)*, 2019, 5572-5581.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **GoPro Dataset**: A dataset containing 2,103 image pairs for training and 1,111 pairs for evaluation, used for motion deblurring tasks.
- **HIDE Dataset**: A dataset specifically built for human-aware deblurring, containing 2,025 images in its test set.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately represented for further processing or review.
