To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodal C4: An Open, Billion-scale Corpus of Images Interleaved with Text" by Wanrong Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets. The abstract mentions the release of **Multimodal C4 (mmc4)**, which is a significant dataset consisting of interleaved image/text sequences. This indicates that mmc4 is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors describe mmc4 as a public, billion-scale dataset constructed from public webpages in the cleaned English C4 corpus. This section provides a clear indication of the dataset's purpose and scale.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in the subsections detailing the data curation process, the authors elaborate on the construction of mmc4, including the number of documents, images, and tokens. They mention that mmc4 consists of **101.2 million documents with 571 million images interleaved in 43 billion English tokens**. This detailed description confirms that mmc4 is the main dataset being discussed.

Additionally, the authors mention the release of two subsets of mmc4:
1. **mmc4-ff**: A version that removes images with detected faces.
2. **mmc4-core**: A more strictly filtered and downsized version of the corpus.

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The primary dataset, **Multimodal C4**, is referenced as follows:
- For **Multimodal C4 (mmc4)**, the citation is:
  > Wanrong Zhu, Jack Hessel, Anas Awadalla, Samir Yitzhak Gadre, Jesse Dodge, Alex Fang, Youngjae Yu, Ludwig Schmidt, William Yang Wang, Yejin Choi. *Multimodal C4: An Open, Billion-scale Corpus of Images Interleaved with Text*. In Proceedings of the 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023), 2023.

The subsets do not have separate citations as they are part of the main dataset release.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will include the main dataset and its subsets, highlighting their unique characteristics and the context in which they were created.
