To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CNN-Based PET Sinogram Repair to Mitigate Defective Block Detectors" by William Whiteley and Jens Gregor, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but the details about datasets are likely to be found in the materials and methods section.

In **section 2.2 (Experimental Data Sets)**, the authors describe the dataset used for training and testing their Sinogram Repair Network. They mention that the data was acquired using a Siemens Biograph mCT scanner from **20 PET/CT patient scans**. This indicates that the dataset is derived from clinical patient data.

The authors specify that the resulting dataset contains **66,798 raw (uncorrected) sinogram slices**, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's size and nature. They also mention that **2 randomly selected patients** were used for the test set, totaling **7,164 sinograms**, while the remaining slices were used for training.

Next, I will look for any references to the original source of the dataset or any related publications that describe the dataset in detail. However, in this case, the authors do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, as it is derived from clinical scans.

Since the dataset is based on clinical data, I will note that it is important to reference the ethical considerations and approvals typically required for using patient data in research. However, the paper does not explicitly mention these details.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring to include the relevant details about the dataset, including its size, source, and any specific characteristics mentioned in the paper.

The full citation for the paper itself is:
> William Whiteley and Jens Gregor. *CNN-Based PET Sinogram Repair to Mitigate Defective Block Detectors*. Preprint version. Manuscript submitted to the Journal of Physics in Medicine and Biology, July 4, 2019.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information, ensuring that I include the citation for the paper as it is the primary source of the dataset description.
