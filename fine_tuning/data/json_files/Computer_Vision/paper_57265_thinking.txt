To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Latent Space Diffusion Models of Cryo-EM Structures" by Karsten Kreis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method on "two synthetic and two real datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper. I will look for specific names and descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **Results section**, particularly **section 3 (Results)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **linear1d**: A synthetic dataset where ground truth volumes are generated along a continuous 1-dimensional linear reaction coordinate.
2. **circular1d**: Another synthetic dataset similar to linear1d but generated along a circular reaction coordinate.
3. **ribosome**: A real dataset containing a mixture of assembly intermediates of the E. coli large ribosomal subunit, sourced from EMPIAR-10076.
4. **covid**: A real dataset of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein transitioning between open and closed conformations, referenced from the work of Walls et al.

In the **Methods section**, the authors provide additional context about how these datasets were generated and used, confirming their relevance to the experiments conducted.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **ribosome dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. H. Davis. *Modular assembly of the bacterial large ribosomal subunit*. Cell, 167, 2016.

- For the **covid dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alexandra C. Walls, Young-Jun Park, M. Alejandra Tortorici, Abigail Wall, Andrew T. McGuire, and David Veesler. *Structure, function, and antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein*. Cell, 181(2):281â€“292.e6, April 2020.

The synthetic datasets (linear1d and circular1d) do not have specific citations as they are generated datasets described in the paper itself.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the representation of each dataset's significance and source.
