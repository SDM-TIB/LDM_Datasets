To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FocusNet: Imbalanced Large and Small Organ Segmentation with an End-to-End Deep Neural Network for Head and Neck CT Images" by Yunhe Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method was tested on both a self-collected dataset and the MICCAI 2015 Head and Neck Auto Segmentation Challenge dataset, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the datasets in detail. In this section, they mention:

1. **Self-collected HaN Dataset**: This dataset consists of 50 CT scans collected from hospitals, with 18 organs delineated manually by doctors. The authors specify that they used 40 samples for training and 10 for testing.

2. **MICCAI 2015 Head and Neck Auto Segmentation Challenge Dataset**: This dataset includes 38 samples for training and 10 for testing, with annotations for 9 organs.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **MICCAI 2015 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Raudaschl, P.F., et al. "Evaluation of segmentation methods on head and neck CT: Auto-segmentation challenge 2015." *Medical Physics* 44(5), 2020â€“2036, 2017.

Since the self-collected dataset does not have a formal citation in the references, I will note it as an internal dataset used by the authors.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the full citations where applicable. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
