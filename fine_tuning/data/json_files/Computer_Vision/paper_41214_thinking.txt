To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SANet: Superpixel Attention Network for Skin Lesion Attributes Detection," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on the **ISIC 2018 skin lesion challenge**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the **Experiments and Results** section, the authors explicitly state that they conducted their framework on the **ISIC 2018 skin lesion challenge** dataset, which consists of 2,594 samples for training and 1,000 images for testing. They also mention the specific attributes being detected: **Globules, Milia like cyst, Negative network, Pigment network, and Streaks**.

Now, I will check the **References** section to find the full citation for the ISIC 2018 dataset. The paper mentions that the dataset is available through a challenge link, which is a common practice for datasets used in competitions. I will note the citation as follows:

- **ISIC 2018 skin lesion challenge**:
  > ISIC Archive. (2018). *ISIC 2018 Skin Lesion Challenge*. Retrieved from https://challenge2018.isic-archive.com/live-leaderboards/

Since the paper does not provide additional datasets, I will focus solely on the ISIC 2018 dataset for my structured output.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will allow for proper attribution and facilitate further research or validation of the findings presented in the paper.
