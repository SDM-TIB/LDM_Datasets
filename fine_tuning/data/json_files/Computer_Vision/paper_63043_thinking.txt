To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Prior Based Online Lane Graph Extraction from Single Onboard Camera Image" by Yigit Baran Can et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract states that the authors tested their method on two benchmark datasets, **NuScenes** and **Argoverse**, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors explicitly mention using the **NuScenes** and **Argoverse** datasets for their experiments. This section will provide additional context about how these datasets were utilized in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations are important for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources of the datasets.

1. For the **NuScenes dataset**, the citation is:
   > Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H. Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yu Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *NuScenes: A Multimodal Dataset for Autonomous Driving*. arXiv:1903.11027, 2019.

2. For the **Argoverse dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ming-Fang Chang, John Lambert, Patsorn Sangkloy, Jagjeet Singh, Slawomir Bak, Andrew Hartnett, De Wang, Peter Carr, Simon Lucey, Deva Ramanan, and James Hays. *Argoverse: 3D Tracking and Forecasting with Rich Maps*. In CVPR 2019, pages 8748â€“8757. Computer Vision Foundation / IEEE, 2019.

Having gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
