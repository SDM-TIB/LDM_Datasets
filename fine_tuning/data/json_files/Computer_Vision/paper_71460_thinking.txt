To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bigger is not Always Better: Scaling Properties of Latent Diffusion Models" by Kangfu Mei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the empirical analysis of latent diffusion models and mentions training on "about 600 million aesthetically-filtered text-to-image pairs." This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find the specific name and citation.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Scaling LDMs)**, where the authors describe the training process and the datasets used. They mention that the models were trained on "internal data sources with about 600 million aesthetically-filtered text-to-image pairs." However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset in the text.

I will also check the **experiments and results sections** to see if any other datasets are referenced. In section 3.1, they evaluate the performance of the models on the **COCO-2014 validation set** with 30k samples, which is a well-known dataset for image recognition tasks. Additionally, they mention testing on the **DIV2K dataset** for super-resolution tasks, which contains high-quality images.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. **COCO-2014 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., DollÃ¡r, P., Zitnick, C.L. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In: European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

2. **DIV2K Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Timofte, R., De Smet, V., & Van Gool, L. (2017). *A+: Towards Real-Time Super Resolution for Realistic Videos*. In: Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

Since the authors did not provide a specific citation for the "600 million aesthetically-filtered text-to-image pairs," I will note that this dataset is internal and does not have a public citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for the COCO-2014 and DIV2K datasets, while noting the internal dataset without a citation.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
