To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Anomaly Detection With Conditional Variational Autoencoders" by Adrian Alan Pol et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the application of the method to "classical machine learning (ML) benchmarks" and "our application," which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly mention using the **MNIST** and **Fashion-MNIST** datasets for their anomaly detection experiments. I will note the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and how they are used in the experiments.

In section IV, the authors describe the MNIST dataset as containing gray-level images of handwritten digits and the Fashion-MNIST dataset as containing images of clothing items. They also mention the specific setup for anomaly detection using these datasets, which reinforces their relevance.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, Patrick Haffner, et al. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For the **Fashion-MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-mnist: a novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

Additionally, the paper discusses a synthetic dataset used for testing, which is generated based on specific parameters. However, since it is synthetic and not a publicly available dataset, I will not include it in the final dataset entries.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
