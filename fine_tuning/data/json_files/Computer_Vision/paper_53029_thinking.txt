To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Video K-Net: A Simple, Strong, and Unified Baseline for Video Segmentation" by Xiangtai Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention achieving state-of-the-art results on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention four datasets: **KITTI-STEP**, **Cityscapes-VPS**, **VSPW**, and **VIPSeg**. I will take note of the context in which each dataset is mentioned, including any specific details about their use in the experiments.

1. **KITTI-STEP**: This dataset is referenced multiple times, and the authors describe it as having 21 training and 29 testing sequences. They also mention that the training sequences are split into a training set and a validation set.

2. **Cityscapes-VPS**: The authors describe this dataset as containing 400 training, 50 validation, and 50 test videos. They note that all 30 frames are predicted during inference, and only 6 frames with ground truth are evaluated.

3. **VSPW**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of video semantic segmentation, and the authors refer to it as a large-scale dataset for evaluating video segmentation tasks.

4. **VIPSeg**: The authors mention this dataset as a challenging VPS dataset and provide performance metrics achieved on it.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

- For **KITTI-STEP**, the citation is:
  > M. Weber, J. Xie, M. Collins, Yukun Zhu, P. Voigtlaender, H. Adam, B. Green, A. Geiger, B. Leibe, D. Cremers, Aljosa Osep, L. Leal-Taixe, and Liang-Chieh Chen. *STEP: Segmenting and Tracking Every Pixel*. In NeurIPS, 2021.

- For **Cityscapes-VPS**, the citation is:
  > Dahun Kim, Sanghyun Woo, Joon-Young Lee, and In So Kweon. *Video Panoptic Segmentation*. In CVPR, 2020.

- For **VSPW**, the citation is:
  > Jiaxu Miao, Yunchao Wei, Yu Wu, Chen Liang, Guangrui Li, and Yi Yang. *VSPW: A Large-Scale Dataset for Video Scene Parsing in the Wild*. In CVPR, 2021.

- For **VIPSeg**, the citation is:
  > Jiaxu Miao, Xiaohan Wang, Yu Wu, Wei Li, Xu Zhang, Yunchao Wei, and Yi Yang. *Large-Scale Video Panoptic Segmentation in the Wild: A Benchmark*. In CVPR, 2022.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
