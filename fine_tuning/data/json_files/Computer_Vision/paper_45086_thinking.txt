To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GraphXCOVID: Explainable Deep Graph Diffusion Pseudo-Labelling for Identifying COVID-19 on Chest X-rays" by Angelica I. Aviles-Rivero et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a semi-supervised framework for classifying COVID-19 from chest X-rays, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Introduction** section, where the authors mention the challenges of obtaining large labeled datasets for COVID-19 detection. They reference existing datasets, which may provide clues about the datasets used in their experiments.

In the **Experimental Results section**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that they evaluated their approach on the **COVIDx Dataset**, which is described as the largest and most diverse dataset for COVID-19, containing 15,254 chest X-ray images. They also mention that this dataset merges five different repositories, which is crucial information for citation.

I will also look for any references to external datasets used for validation, such as the **BIMCV-COVID19 dataset**, which is mentioned as an external dataset for evaluating generalization to out-of-distribution samples.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **COVIDx Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Wang, L., & Wong, A. (2020). COVID-Net: A tailored deep convolutional neural network design for detection of COVID-19 cases from chest radiography images. *Available online*: https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09871.

2. **BIMCV-COVID19 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > De La Iglesia Vayá, M., Saborit, J. A., Montell, A., Pertusa, A., Bustos, A., Cazorla, M., Galant, J., Barber, X., Orozco-Beltrán, D., & García-García, F. (2020). BIMCV COVID-19+: A large annotated dataset of RX and CT images from COVID-19 patients. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.01174*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are captured for future reference or processing.
