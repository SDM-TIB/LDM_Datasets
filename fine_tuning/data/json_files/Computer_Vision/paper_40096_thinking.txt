To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Refined-Segmentation R-CNN: A Two-stage Convolutional Neural Network for Punctate White Matter Lesion Segmentation in Preterm Infants" by Yalong Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it mentions the use of T1w MRIs, it does not specify a dataset. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of segmenting Punctate White Matter Lesions (PWML) in preterm infants but do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **methods section** where they describe their approach in detail.

In the **experiments section**, the authors state that they used a dataset containing **70 subjects with 704 slices** of PWMLs, which is provided by a cooperative hospital with a 3T MRI scanner. This is a crucial piece of information, but I need to find the full citation for this dataset.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if there are any citations that correspond to the dataset used in the study. The references do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, but they do reference several studies related to PWML and MRI techniques.

Since the dataset is described as being collected from a cooperative hospital and confirmed by a neonatal neurologist, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. However, I will note the details provided in the paper for clarity.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the dataset:

1. **PWML Dataset**: This dataset consists of 70 subjects with 704 slices of T1w MRIs containing Punctate White Matter Lesions. The dataset was confirmed by an experienced neonatal neurologist and is not formally cited in the references.

Since the dataset does not have a formal citation, I will document the details as described in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset information in a structured format, ensuring that I include all relevant details for clarity and future reference.
