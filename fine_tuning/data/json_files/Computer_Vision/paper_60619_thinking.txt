To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spherical Inducing Features for Orthogonally-Decoupled Gaussian Processes" by Louis C. Tiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that "Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach." This indicates that there are datasets used in the experiments, but it does not specify which ones.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the limitations of Gaussian processes and the need for improved methods, but they do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these are likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used.

In the **experiments section (Section 4)**, the authors describe their empirical evaluations. They mention using several datasets, specifically:

1. **UCI Repository Datasets**: The authors state that they evaluate their method on multiple regression problems from the UCI repository, including datasets like YACHT, CONCRETE, ENERGY, KIN8NM, and POWER.

2. **Synthetic 1D Dataset**: They also refer to a synthetic dataset from Snelson & Ghahramani (2007), which is used for testing their method.

3. **Airline Delays Dataset**: The authors mention a large-scale regression dataset concerning U.S. commercial airline delays in 2008, which consists of 5,929,413 flights.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper:

- For the **UCI Repository Datasets**, the citation is:
  > Dua, D. and Graff, C. UCI machine learning repository, 2017. URL http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml.

- For the **Snelson & Ghahramani (2007) dataset**, the citation is:
  > Snelson, E. and Ghahramani, Z. Sparse Gaussian processes using pseudo-inputs. Advances in neural information processing systems, 18, 2005.

- For the **Airline Delays Dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but it can be referenced as:
  > U.S. Department of Transportation. Bureau of Transportation Statistics. *2008 U.S. Airline Delays Dataset*. Available at: [https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_Delay](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_Delay).

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **UCI Repository Datasets**: A collection of various datasets used for regression problems.
2. **Synthetic 1D Dataset**: A dataset from Snelson & Ghahramani (2007) used for testing.
3. **Airline Delays Dataset**: A large-scale dataset concerning U.S. commercial airline delays in 2008.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
