To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-Grained Named Entity Typing over Distantly Supervised Data Based on Refined Representations" by Muhammad Asif Ali et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, while the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of Fine-Grained Named Entity Typing (FG-NET) and mention that distant supervision is used to collect training data. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Wiki/Figer**: This dataset consists of Wikipedia sentences automatically labeled via distant supervision by mapping entity mentions to Freebase types. The testing data consists of news reports manually labeled by Ling and Weld (2012).

2. **OntoNotes**: This dataset includes sentences from newswire documents contained in the OntoNotes corpus, which are mapped to Freebase types via DBpedia Spotlight. The testing data is manually annotated by Gillick et al. (2014).

3. **BBN**: This dataset consists of sentences from the Wall Street Journal annotated by Weischedel and Brunstein (2005). The training data is annotated using DBpedia Spotlight.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Wiki/Figer**, the citation is:
  > Ling, X., & Weld, D. S. (2012). Fine-grained entity recognition. In AAAI. AAAI Press.

- For **OntoNotes**, the citation is:
  > Weischedel, R., Pradhan, S., Ramshaw, L., Palmer, M., Xue, N., Marcus, M., Taylor, A., Greenberg, C., Hovy, E., Belvin, R., et al. (2011). Ontonotes release 4.0. LDC2011T03, Philadelphia, Penn.: Linguistic Data Consortium.

- For **BBN**, the citation is:
  > Weischedel, R., & Brunstein, A. (2005). BBN pronoun coreference and entity type corpus. Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
