To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Weight Function in the Subtree Kernel is Decisive" by Romain AzaÃ¯s and Florian Ingels, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 5 (Real data analysis)**, where the authors discuss various datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will pay close attention to any descriptions of the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and the context in which they were used.

In section 5, the authors mention several datasets:

1. **Vascusynth Dataset**: This dataset consists of 120 unordered trees representing blood vasculatures with different bifurcation numbers. The trees are categorized based on the radius of the vessels.

2. **Wikipedia Datasets**: The authors created multiple datasets from Wikipedia articles, including a small dataset of 40 trees, a medium dataset of 120 trees, and a large dataset of 200 trees, all converted from HTML to tree structures.

3. **Videogame Sellers Dataset**: This dataset includes trees collected from two major websites selling video games, totaling 200 trees.

4. **INEX 2005 and INEX 2006 Datasets**: These datasets consist of XML documents, with INEX 2005 containing 9,630 documents across 11 classes and INEX 2006 containing 12,107 documents across 18 classes.

5. **LOGML Dataset**: This dataset comprises 23,111 unordered labeled trees representing user sessions on an academic website.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations may not always be explicitly listed for datasets, but I will look for any papers or sources referenced that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, the citation for the **Vascusynth Dataset** is:
> Hamarneh, G., & Jassi, P. (2010). Vascusynth: Simulating vascular trees for generating volumetric image data with ground truth segmentation and tree analysis. *Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics*, 34(8), 605-616.

For the **INEX datasets**, the citation is:
> Denoyer, L., & Gallinari, P. (2007). Report on the XML mining track at INEX 2005 and INEX 2006: Categorization and clustering of XML documents. *SIGIR Forum*, 41, 79-90.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
