To extract datasets from the research paper titled "JINA CLIP: Your CLIP Model Is Also Your Text Retriever" by Andreas Koukounas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data preparation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a novel training method and mentions the use of large-scale image-caption pairs and text pairs, suggesting that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Data Preparation)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for training. Here, I find the following datasets:

1. **LAION-400M**: This dataset contains 400 million image-text pairs derived from Common Crawl and is widely used for multimodal training.

2. **ShareGPT4V**: This dataset consists of approximately 100K synthetic captions generated with GPT4v and an additional 1.1 million long captions generated by a large captioning model, totaling around 1.2 million image captions.

3. **MSMarco**: This dataset is mentioned as part of the triplet text corpus used in Stage 3, which includes hard negatives.

4. **Natural Questions (NQ)**: Another dataset included in the triplet text corpus for training.

5. **HotpotQA**: This dataset is also part of the triplet text corpus.

6. **Natural Language Inference (NLI)**: This dataset is mentioned as part of the training corpus that includes hard negatives.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
