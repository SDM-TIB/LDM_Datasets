To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-Tuning Stable Diffusion XL for Stylistic Icon Generation: A Comparison of Caption Size" by Youssef Sultan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilized a dataset from The Home Depot, which suggests that there are specific datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, where the authors describe their approach to fine-tuning Stable Diffusion XL. They mention using a dataset from The Home Depot that contains images of various icon types categorized by their descriptions. They specifically filtered this dataset to focus on two categories: screws and kitchen cabinets. 

In this section, they state that they ended up with **42 icon images related to screws** and **42 icon images related to kitchen cabinets**. This gives me the first two datasets to document.

Additionally, the authors mention that they also used a **public icon dataset** that includes 42 images, which they gathered from online resources. This dataset is relevant for their experiments and should be noted as well.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are primarily derived from The Home Depot and a public dataset, I will focus on the citation for The Home Depot dataset, as it is the main dataset used in their experiments.

The citation for the dataset from The Home Depot is not explicitly provided in the references, but I can note that it is a proprietary dataset. For the public dataset, since it is mentioned that they gathered icons from online resources, I will not have a specific citation for it either.

Now, I will summarize the datasets extracted:

1. **Home Depot Icon Dataset**: Contains 42 images of screws and 42 images of kitchen cabinets, categorized by their descriptions.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided; proprietary dataset.

2. **Public Icon Dataset**: Includes 42 images gathered from online resources, primarily using Google search, ChatGPT, and Gemini.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided; gathered from various online sources.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their details as described in the paper.
