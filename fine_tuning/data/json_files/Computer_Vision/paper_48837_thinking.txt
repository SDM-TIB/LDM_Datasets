To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Handwritten Digit Recognition using Machine and Deep Learning Algorithms" by Ritik Dixit et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors performed handwritten digit recognition using the **MNIST dataset**, which is a clear indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look into the **methodology section**, specifically section III, where the authors discuss the dataset in detail. Here, they describe the **MNIST dataset** as a combination of two NIST databases, containing 70,000 handwritten digit images (60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing) with specific dimensions (28x28 pixels). This section provides essential details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **related work section** to see if any other datasets are mentioned or referenced. However, the focus remains on the MNIST dataset throughout the paper, and no additional datasets are introduced.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the MNIST dataset within the text, but I know that the MNIST dataset is widely recognized and can be cited as follows:

- **MNIST Dataset Citation**:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. Since the paper primarily focuses on the MNIST dataset, I will create a single entry for it.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise dataset entry ready for further use or analysis.
