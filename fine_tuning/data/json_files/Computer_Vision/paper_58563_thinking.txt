To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Toward Extremely Lightweight Distracted Driver Recognition With Distillation-Based Neural Architecture Search and Knowledge Transfer" by Dichao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two datasets: the **Statefarm Distracted Driver Detection Dataset** and the **AUC Distracted Driver Dataset**. This is a good starting point.

Next, I will look into the **Datasets section** (which is likely to be found in the methodology or experimental setup) to gather more details about these datasets. The authors describe the **Statefarm Distracted Driver Detection Dataset (SFD3)** as having 22,424 images for training and 79,728 unlabeled images for testing, while the **AUC Distracted Driver Dataset (AUCD2)** contains 17,308 RGB frames, with 12,977 for training and 4,331 for testing. This confirms that both datasets are indeed used in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

The citations I need to extract are:

1. For the **Statefarm Distracted Driver Detection Dataset**, the citation is:
   > StateFarm. “State farm distracted driver detection.” https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection, 2020.

2. For the **AUC Distracted Driver Dataset**, the citation is:
   > Alotaibi, M., & Alotaibi, B. (2019). “Distracted driver classification using deep learning.” Signal, Image and Video Processing, pp. 1-8.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as they are essential for academic integrity and reproducibility.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured output that can be used for further analysis or sharing.
