To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Intrusion Detection System for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle with Less Labeling Effort" by Kyung Ho Park, Eunji Park, and Huy Kang Kim, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiment sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of intrusion detection systems (IDS) for UAVs and the limitations of previous methods. While this section may not directly mention datasets, it sets the context for the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Proposed Methodology)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention the "Hardware-In-The-Loop (HITL) UAV DoS & GPS Spoofing Attacks on MAVLINK dataset." This is a clear indication of the dataset being utilized.

The authors provide a detailed description of the dataset, including the types of logs it contains: benign flight data, DoS attack logs, and GPS spoofing attack logs. They also explain how they confirmed the ground truth of the dataset by checking timestamps, which adds credibility to the dataset's integrity.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- For the **HITL UAV DoS & GPS Spoofing Attacks on MAVLINK dataset**, the citation is:
  > Whelan, J., Sangarapillai, T., Minawi, O., Almehmadi, A., El-Khatib, K. (2020). *UAV Attack Dataset*. IEEE Dataport. http://dx.doi.org/10.21227/00dg-0d12

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **HITL UAV DoS & GPS Spoofing Attacks on MAVLINK dataset**: This dataset contains system logs collected during simulated flights under three conditions: benign flight, DoS attack, and GPS spoofing attack. The dataset is crucial for training and validating the proposed IDS model.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
