To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SICRN: Advancing Speech Enhancement Through State Space Model and Inplace Convolution Techniques" by Changjiang Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on the **DNS Challenge (INTERSPEECH 2020) dataset**, which is a strong indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used for their experiments. They mention the **DNS Challenge dataset**, describing it as follows:

- The clean speech set includes over **500 hours of clips from 2150 speakers**.
- The noise dataset includes over **180 hours of clips from 150 classes**.
- They also describe how they simulated speech-noise mixtures for training.

This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides specific details about its composition.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DNS Challenge dataset. The relevant citation is:

> Chandan KA Reddy, Vishak Gopal, Ross Cutler, Ebrahim Beyrami, Roger Cheng, Harishchandra Dubey, Sergiy Matusevych, Robert Aichner, Ashkan Aazami, Sebastian Braun, et al. "The Interspeech 2020 Deep Noise Suppression Challenge: Datasets, Subjective Testing Framework, and Challenge Results." arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.13981, 2020.

Since the authors do not mention any other datasets in the paper, I will compile the information about the DNS Challenge dataset into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is complete and ready for any further processing or review.
