To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simple Domain Generalization Methods are Strong Baselines for Open Domain Generalization" by Masashi Noguchi and Shinichi Shirakawa, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the need for evaluating domain generalization methods on various datasets. This suggests that datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they explicitly mention three public datasets:

1. **PACS**: A seven-class image classification dataset with images from four domains: Photo (P), Art (A), Cartoon (C), and Sketch (S).
2. **Office-Home**: A 65-class image classification dataset with images from four domains: Art (Ar), Clipart (Cl), Product (Pr), and Real-World (Rw).
3. **Multi-Datasets**: This dataset consists of several different datasets, including Office-31, VisDA2017, STL-10, and DomainNet.

I will also check the **tables** provided in the experiments section for additional details about the datasets, such as the class distributions and experimental settings.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations:

- For **PACS**, the citation is:
  > Li, D., Yang, Y., Song, Y.-Z., & Hospedales, T. M. (2017). *Deeper, broader and artier domain generalization*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

- For **Office-Home**, the citation is:
  > Venkateswara, H., Eusebio, J., Chakraborty, S., & Panchanathan, S. (2017). *Deep hashing network for unsupervised domain adaptation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For **Multi-Datasets**, the citation is:
  > Shu, Y., Cao, Z., Wang, C., Wang, J., & Long, M. (2021). *Open domain generalization with domain-augmented meta-learning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

Now, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for further processing.
