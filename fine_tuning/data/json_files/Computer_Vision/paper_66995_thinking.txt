To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Solving Linear Inverse Problems Provably via Posterior Sampling with Latent Diffusion Models" by Litu Rout et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research problem.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **FFHQ dataset** and the **ImageNet dataset** for their experiments. I will note the details provided about these datasets:

1. **FFHQ Dataset**: The paper states that they conducted experiments on a subset of the FFHQ dataset, which is downscaled to 256 × 256 resolution. This dataset is commonly used for training generative models and is known for its high-quality images of human faces.

2. **ImageNet Dataset**: The authors also mention using images from the ImageNet dataset, resized to 256 × 256 resolution. ImageNet is a large-scale dataset widely used for image classification and object detection tasks.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For the **FFHQ dataset**:
  > Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. *A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2019, pp. 4401–4410.

- For the **ImageNet dataset**:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009, pp. 248–255.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
