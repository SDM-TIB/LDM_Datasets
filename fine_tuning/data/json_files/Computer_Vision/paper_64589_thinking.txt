To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ZS6D: Zero-shot 6D Object Pose Estimation using Vision Transformers" by Philipp Ausserlechner et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were performed on three datasets: **LMO, YCBV, and TLESS**. This is a good starting point for my extraction.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section IV (Experiments), the authors explicitly mention that they evaluate their method on the **LMO**, **YCBV**, and **TLESS** datasets. They describe the challenges associated with each dataset, such as occlusion in LMO, illumination changes in YCBV, and texture-less objects in TLESS. This confirms that these datasets are indeed used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets in detail:

1. **LMO Dataset**: The citation is:
   > T. Hodan, F. Michel, E. Brachmann, W. Kehl, A. GlentBuch, D. Kraft, B. Drost, J. Vidal, S. Ihrke, X. Zabulis, et al. "BOP: Benchmark for 6D Object Pose Estimation." In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2018, pp. 19–34.

2. **YCBV Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Y. Xiang, T. Schmidt, V. Narayanan, and D. Fox. "PoseCNN: A Convolutional Neural Network for 6D Object Pose Estimation in Cluttered Scenes." arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.00199, 2017.

3. **TLESS Dataset**: The citation is:
   > T. Hodan, P. Haluza, S. Obdrzálek, J. Matas, M. Lourakis, and X. Zabulis. "T-less: An RGB-D Dataset for 6D Pose Estimation of Texture-less Objects." In 2017 IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), IEEE, 2017, pp. 880–888.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **LMO**: A dataset that presents challenges related to occlusion in object pose estimation.
- **YCBV**: A dataset that focuses on pose estimation under varying illumination conditions.
- **TLESS**: A dataset that includes texture-less objects, posing unique challenges for pose estimation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all necessary information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
