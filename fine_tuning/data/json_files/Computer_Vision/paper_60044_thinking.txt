To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SMPConv: Self-moving Point Representations for Continuous Convolution" by Sanghyeon Kim and Eunbyung Park, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on **large-scale settings, e.g., ImageNet**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) to identify specific datasets used for evaluation. In section 4.1, the authors discuss their experiments on **sequential datasets** and mention using **sMNIST, pMNIST, and sCIFAR10** for sequential image classification. This is a clear indication that these datasets are part of their evaluation.

In section 4.3, the authors mention using the **CIFAR10 dataset** for image classification, which is another dataset that needs to be documented.

Additionally, in section 4.4, they refer to the **ImageNet dataset** for large-scale image classification experiments. This dataset is crucial as it is widely recognized in the field.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **sMNIST (Sequential MNIST)**: 
   > Le, Q. V., Jaitly, N., & Hinton, G. E. (2015). A simple way to initialize recurrent networks of rectified linear units. arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.00941.

2. **pMNIST (Permuted MNIST)**: 
   > Le, Q. V., Jaitly, N., & Hinton, G. E. (2015). A simple way to initialize recurrent networks of rectified linear units. arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.00941.

3. **sCIFAR10 (Sequential CIFAR10)**: 
   > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. 

4. **CIFAR10**: 
   > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images.

5. **ImageNet**: 
   > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database. In CVPR (pp. 248â€“255). IEEE.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **sMNIST**: A sequential version of the MNIST dataset, used for sequential image classification tasks.
2. **pMNIST**: A permuted version of the MNIST dataset, also used for sequential image classification tasks.
3. **sCIFAR10**: A sequential version of the CIFAR10 dataset, used for sequential image classification tasks.
4. **CIFAR10**: A well-known dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
5. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset for image classification, containing over a million images across thousands of categories.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its full citation, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured for future reference or analysis.
