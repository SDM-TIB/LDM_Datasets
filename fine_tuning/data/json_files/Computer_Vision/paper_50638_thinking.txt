To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating 3D Molecules Conditional on Receptor Binding Sites with Deep Generative Models" by Matthew Ragoza et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets used. In the introduction, the authors often discuss the context of their research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsection titled **"Training data set"**. Here, the authors describe the **CrossDocked2020 dataset**, which is a significant dataset used in their research. They mention that it consists of a large collection of small molecules docked into cognate and non-cognate receptors, and they provide details about how this dataset was constructed.

In the methods section, I will also look for any other datasets mentioned, especially in the context of the algorithms or models used. The authors may refer to other datasets that were utilized for training or validation purposes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. For the **CrossDocked2020 dataset**, the citation is:
> Francoeur, P. G., Masuda, T., Sunseri, J., Jia, A., Iovanisci, R. B., Snyder, I., & Koes, D. R. (2020). *CrossDocked2020: A large dataset for protein-ligand docking*. Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, 60(8), 4200-4215.

I will ensure to note any additional datasets mentioned in the paper, along with their respective citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets from the research paper.
