To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Diffusion Models" by Grigory Bartosh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate the utility of Neural Diffusion Models (NDMs) through experiments on various image generation benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention the datasets they used for evaluation:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits, commonly used for training various image processing systems.
2. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
3. **Downsampled ImageNet**: A smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, which is a large visual database designed for use in visual object recognition software research.
4. **CelebA-HQ**: A high-quality version of the CelebA dataset, which contains celebrity images with various attributes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Deng, L. (2012). The MNIST database of handwritten digit images for machine learning research. *IEEE Signal Processing Magazine*, 29(6), 141-142.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database. In *2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition*, 248-255.

- For **CelebA-HQ**, the citation is:
  > Karras, T., Aila, T., Laine, S., & Lehtinen, J. (2017). Progressive growing of GANs for improved quality, stability, and variation. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.10196*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
