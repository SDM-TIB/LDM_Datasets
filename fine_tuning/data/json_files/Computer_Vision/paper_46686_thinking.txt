To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "A Layer-Wise Information Reinforcement Approach to Improve Learning in Deep Belief Networks" by Mateus Roder et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted over three public datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Methodology)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **MNIST**: This dataset consists of 28 × 28 binary images of handwritten digits (0-9), with a training set of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images.

2. **Fashion-MNIST**: Similar in structure to MNIST, this dataset contains 28 × 28 binary images of clothing objects, with 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

3. **Kuzushiji-MNIST**: This dataset includes 28 × 28 binary images of hiragana characters, also with a training set of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images.

I will then verify the details of these datasets in the **experiments section** to ensure they are indeed the ones used for evaluation, which they are, as the authors refer to them throughout their experimental results.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For **Fashion-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Ludwig Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: a novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

- For **Kuzushiji-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > T. Clanuwat, M. Bober-Irizar, A. Kitamoto, A. Lamb, K. Yamamoto, D. Ha. *Deep learning for classical Japanese literature*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1812.01718, 2018.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
