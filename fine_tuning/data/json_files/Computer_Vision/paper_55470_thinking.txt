To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Video Restoration with a Deep Plug-and-Play Prior" by Antoine Monod et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on various video restoration tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and the context in which they were used.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention the **DAVIS-2017 dataset** in their experiments. This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of their video restoration methods. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its purpose and any specific characteristics mentioned.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the DAVIS-2017 dataset. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and will typically include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

The citation for the DAVIS-2017 dataset is:
> Jordi Pont-Tuset, Federico Perazzi, Sergi Caelles, Pablo Arbel√°ez, Alexander Sorkine-Hornung, and Luc Van Gool. *The 2017 davis challenge on video object segmentation*. arXiv:1704.00675, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
