To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards AI-Architecture Liberty: A Comprehensive Survey on Designing and Collaborating Virtual Architecture by Deep Learning in the Metaverse" by Anqi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a general overview, and the introduction often highlights the significance of datasets in the context of the research.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors typically describe their research design and data sources. In this paper, the authors mention reviewing a sample of 187 related articles and specifically refer to three 3D building datasets that are crucial for their analysis.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any subsections that explicitly list the datasets used in their research. In this case, the authors mention:

1. **BuildingNet**: A large-scale collection of 3D building models with labeled exteriors.
2. **HouseNet**: A selective collection of preprocessed models developed from BuildingNet.
3. **3DBAG**: A dataset containing 3D building models of the Netherlands, featuring multiple levels of detail.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **BuildingNet**:
  > Pratheba Selvaraju et al. (2021). *BuildingNet: Learning to Label 3D Buildings*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 10377–10387. https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV48922.2021.01023

- For **HouseNet**:
  > Lisa-Marie Mueller. (2023). *3D Generative Adversarial Networks to Autonomously Generate Building Geometry*. Master’s thesis. TU Delft. https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:b4a44f69-e3a4-4a29-85c4-77a7e899b81a?collection=education

- For **3DBAG**:
  > Ravi Peters et al. (2022). *Automated 3D reconstruction of LoD2 and LoD1 models for all 10 million buildings of the Netherlands*. https://doi.org/10.14358/PERS.21-00032R2

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
