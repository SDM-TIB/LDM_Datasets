To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distribution Aligned Diffusion and Prototype-guided network for Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Segmentation" by Haipeng Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on **fundus datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this case, they mention using three publicly available fundus datasets. I will look for specific names and details about these datasets.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **REFUGE Dataset**: This dataset is used as the source domain and includes 400 annotated training images. It is specifically designed for glaucoma assessment from fundus photographs.

2. **RIM-ONE-r3 Dataset**: This dataset serves as one of the target domains for testing. It is referenced in the context of having a domain gap with the REFUGE dataset.

3. **Drishti-GS Dataset**: This is the second target domain mentioned for testing, also related to glaucoma assessment.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **REFUGE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Orlando, J.I., Fu, H., Breda, J.B., van Keer, K., Bathula, D.R., et al. "REFUGE Challenge: A unified framework for evaluating automated methods for glaucoma assessment from fundus photographs." *Medical Image Analysis*, 59, 101570, 2020.

- For the **RIM-ONE-r3 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Fumero, F., AlayÃ³n, S., Sanchez, J.L., Sigut, J., Gonzalez-Hernandez, M. "RIM-ONE: An open retinal image database for optic nerve evaluation." In *International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems*, pp. 1-6, IEEE, 2011.

- For the **Drishti-GS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sivaswamy, J., Krishnadas, S., Chakravarty, A., Joshi, G., Tabish, A.S., et al. "A comprehensive retinal image dataset for the assessment of glaucoma from the optic nerve head analysis." *JSM Biomedical Imaging Data Papers*, 2(1), 1004, 2015.

With these details in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
