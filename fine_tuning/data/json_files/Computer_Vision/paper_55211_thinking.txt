To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mix-Pooling Strategy for Attention Mechanism" by Shanshan Zhong, Wushao Wen, and Jinghui Qin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed attention module, SPEM, but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention conducting experiments on **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100**. This indicates that these two datasets are relevant to their research.

I will then look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets within the paper. The authors provide some information about CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 in the **Dataset and Implementation Details** subsection. They mention that both datasets contain 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, with CIFAR10 having 10 classes and CIFAR100 having 100 classes. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The CIFAR datasets are well-known, and their citations are typically included in the literature. The citations for these datasets are:

- For **CIFAR10**:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR100**:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

Since both datasets are from the same source, I will ensure to note that in my extraction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for both CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, as they are essential for proper attribution and further research.

After completing these steps, I will be ready to present the extracted datasets in the required format for review or further processing.
