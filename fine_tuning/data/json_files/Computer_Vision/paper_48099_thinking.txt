To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Anomaly Detection with Prototype-Guided Discriminative Latent Embeddings" by Yuandu Lai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on three benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they refer to three datasets:

1. **UCSD Ped2**: This dataset is described as containing 16 training and 12 testing videos, focusing on unusual pedestrian patterns, such as skateboards and bicycles.

2. **CUHK Avenue**: This dataset consists of 16 training and 21 testing videos captured in a campus avenue, containing various abnormal events like running and throwing objects.

3. **ShanghaiTech**: This is noted as the most recent and largest dataset, containing 330 training and 107 test videos with diverse abnormal events, including both appearance and motion anomalies.

To confirm the details of these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **UCSD Ped2**, the citation is:
  > Mahadevan, V., Li, W., Bhalodia, V., & Vasconcelos, N. (2010). *Anomaly detection in crowded scenes*. In 2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (pp. 1975–1981).

- For **CUHK Avenue**, the citation is:
  > Lu, C., Shi, J., & Jia, J. (2013). *Abnormal event detection at 150 fps in matlab*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (pp. 2720–2727).

- For **ShanghaiTech**, the citation is:
  > Luo, W., Liu, W., & Gao, S. (2017). *A revisit of sparse coding based anomaly detection in stacked RNN framework*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (pp. 341–349).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
