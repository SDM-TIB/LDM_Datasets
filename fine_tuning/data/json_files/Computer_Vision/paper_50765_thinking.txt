To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Calibrated Model for Long-Tailed Visual Recognition from Prior Perspective" by Zhengzhuo Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted extensive experiments on **CIFAR-LT**, **ImageNet-LT**, and **iNaturalist 2018**, indicating that these are the datasets used in their research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about these datasets. The authors mention that these datasets are commonly used for evaluating methods in long-tailed visual recognition, which reinforces their significance in the study.

I will then look into the **experiments** section, specifically focusing on the subsections that detail the datasets used. Here, the authors describe the construction of the **CIFAR-LT** and **ImageNet-LT** datasets, noting that CIFAR-LT is a long-tailed version of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, while ImageNet-LT is derived from the ImageNet dataset following a Pareto distribution.

In the **results** section, the authors provide performance metrics on these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments. They also mention the specific configurations and imbalance factors for each dataset, which are crucial for understanding the context of their findings.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **CIFAR-LT**:
   - The CIFAR-LT dataset is based on the original CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. The citation for the original CIFAR datasets is:
     > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

2. **ImageNet-LT**:
   - The ImageNet-LT dataset is derived from the ImageNet dataset. The citation for the original ImageNet dataset is:
     > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael S. Bernstein, Alexander C. Berg, and Fei-Fei Li. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211–252, 2015.

3. **iNaturalist 2018**:
   - The citation for the iNaturalist dataset is:
     > Grant Van Horn, Oisin Mac Aodha, Yang Song, Yin Cui, Chen Sun, Alexander Shepard, Hartwig Adam, Pietro Perona, and Serge J. Belongie. *The iNaturalist Species Classification and Detection Dataset*. In 2018 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, CVPR 2018, pages 8769–8778, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This structured approach will help in effectively extracting and documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
