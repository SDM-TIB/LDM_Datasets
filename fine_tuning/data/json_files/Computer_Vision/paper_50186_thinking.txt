To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OSCAR: Data-Driven Operational Space Control for Adaptive and Robust Robot Manipulation" by Josiah Wong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the OSCAR method on various simulated manipulation problems, which suggests that datasets may be involved, but I need to confirm this in the main body of the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) closely, as this is typically where datasets used for evaluation are detailed. In this section, the authors describe three specific manipulation tasks: **Path Tracing**, **Cup Pouring**, and **Puck Pushing**. I will look for any references to datasets or simulation environments used for these tasks.

Upon reviewing the experiments, I find that the authors mention using **Isaac Gym** as the simulation environment for their experiments. This is a crucial piece of information, as it indicates the platform on which the datasets for the tasks were generated.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for **Isaac Gym**. The relevant citation is:

- For **Isaac Gym**:
  > V. Makoviychuk, L. Wawrzyniak, Y. Guo, M. Macklin, D. Hoeller, N. Rudin, A. Allshire, A. Handa, and G. State. *Isaac Gym: High Performance GPU-Based Physics Simulation For Robot Learning*. 2021. eprint: arXiv:2108.10470.

Since the paper does not mention any other specific datasets apart from the simulation environment, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Isaac Gym**: A high-performance GPU-based physics simulation environment used for generating the datasets for the manipulation tasks.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that the full citation is included for the identified dataset.
