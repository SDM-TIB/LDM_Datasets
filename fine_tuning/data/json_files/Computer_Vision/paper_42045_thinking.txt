To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-grained Image-to-Image Transformation towards Visual Recognition" by Wei Xiong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on the **CompCars** and **Multi-PIE** datasets, which suggests these are the primary datasets used in their research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) to gather more detailed descriptions of these datasets. In section 4.1, the authors provide specific information about the datasets:

1. **CompCars Dataset**: This dataset contains over 1,700 categories of car models and 100,000 images. It is used for fine-grained image generation and few-shot learning tasks.

2. **Multi-PIE Dataset**: This dataset includes face images of 337 identities and is also utilized for fine-grained image generation and recognition tasks.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **CompCars Dataset**, the citation is:
  > L. Yang, P. Luo, C. Change Loy, and X. Tang. *A large-scale car dataset for fine-grained categorization and verification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3973–3981, 2015.

- For the **Multi-PIE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Gross, I. Matthews, J. Cohn, T. Kanade, and S. Baker. *Multi-PIE*. Image and Vision Computing, 28(5):807–813, 2010.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately represented the details provided in the paper. This will allow me to compile the dataset entries for further processing or review.
