To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporal Convolution Networks with Positional Encoding for Evoked Expression Estimation" by Van Thong Huynh et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art results on the EEV challenge, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention their method for estimating evoked expressions from a wide range of video types and refer to a subset of the EEV dataset. This is a clear indication that the EEV dataset is relevant to their work.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors provide details about the dataset used. They mention that they conducted experiments on the subset1 of the Evoked Expressions from Videos (EEV) dataset. The paper states that this dataset consists of 2971, 737, and 1315 videos for training, validation, and testing, respectively, and that each video is annotated with values for 15 expressions.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the EEV dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **EEV dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jennifer J Sun, Ting Liu, Alan S Cowen, Florian Schroff, Hartwig Adam, and Gautam Prasad. *EEV dataset: Predicting expressions evoked by diverse videos*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2001.05488, 2020.

Since the authors refer to a subset of the EEV dataset, I will still use the original citation for the dataset.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and prepare to format them according to the required structure, ensuring that the full citation is included for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
