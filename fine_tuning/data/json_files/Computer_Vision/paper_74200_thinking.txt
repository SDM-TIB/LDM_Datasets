To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PuzzleFusion++: Auto-agglomerative 3D Fracture Assembly by Denoise and Verify" by Zhengqing Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that extensive experiments were conducted on the **Breaking Bad dataset**, indicating that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further context about the datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of 3D fracture assembly and mentions the **Breaking Bad dataset** again, reinforcing its importance in the experiments.

I will then look at the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they specify that they used the **Breaking Bad dataset** for their experiments, detailing the number of assemblies and the specific subsets used for training and testing.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention:
- **Breaking Bad dataset**: This dataset includes 34,075 assemblies from 407 objects in the everyday subset for training and 7,679 assemblies from 91 objects in the everyday subset and 3,651 assemblies from 40 uncategorized objects in the artifact subset for testing.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Breaking Bad dataset**. The citation provided in the references is:
> Silvia Sellán, Yun-Chun Chen, Ziyi Wu, Animesh Garg, and Alec Jacobson. *Breaking Bad: A Dataset for Geometric Fracture and Reassembly*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 (2022), 38885–38898.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:
1. **Dataset Name**: Breaking Bad dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset for geometric fracture and reassembly, containing assemblies from various objects.
   - **Citation**: Silvia Sellán, Yun-Chun Chen, Ziyi Wu, Animesh Garg, and Alec Jacobson. *Breaking Bad: A Dataset for Geometric Fracture and Reassembly*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 (2022), 38885–38898.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that the citation is included for proper attribution.
