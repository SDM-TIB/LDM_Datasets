To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling Non-deterministic Human Behaviors in Discrete Food Choices" by Andrew Starnes et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **NHANES dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Problem Formulation)**, where the authors explicitly state their use of the **NHANES dataset** to model food preferences based on demographic information. They describe the dataset as being collected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) repository, which provides demographic features and food preferences.

In **section II.A (NHANES Dataset)**, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset, including its size, the specific survey years (2017-2018), and the types of data collected (demographic features and food preferences). They also mention the specific questionnaire used, the Diet Behavior and Nutrition questionnaire (DBQ), and provide links to the data and documentation.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the NHANES dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. *National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Data, 2022*. Available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=2017

Since the NHANES dataset is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the NHANES dataset, ensuring that it is clear and complete for any further processing or review.
