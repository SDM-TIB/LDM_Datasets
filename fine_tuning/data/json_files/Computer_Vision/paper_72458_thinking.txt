To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exposing Text-Image Inconsistency Using Diffusion Models" by Mingzhen Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors introduce a new dataset called **TIIL**, which contains 14K text-image pairs. This is a clear indication that a dataset is present, and I will need to gather more details about it.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (TIIL Dataset)**, where the authors provide a comprehensive description of the dataset. They explain that the TIIL dataset is constructed from real-world image-text pairs sourced from the **Visual News dataset** and includes both consistent and inconsistent pairs. The dataset consists of approximately 14,000 pairs, with 7,138 labeled as inconsistent and 7,101 as consistent.

The authors also detail the methodology used to create the dataset, emphasizing that it is distinct from existing datasets due to its careful curation and the use of text-to-image diffusion models for generating inconsistencies. This section provides essential information about the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The key datasets identified are:

1. **TIIL Dataset**: The authors created this dataset specifically for their study, so I will cite it as follows:
   > Mingzhen Huang, Shan Jia, Zhou Zhou, Yan Ju, Jialing Cai, Siwei Lyu. *Exposing Text-Image Inconsistency Using Diffusion Models*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2024.

2. **Visual News Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as the source for the real-world image-text pairs used in the TIIL dataset. The citation is:
   > Fuxiao Liu, Yinghan Wang, Tianlu Wang, Vicente Ordonez. *Visual News: Benchmark and Challenges in News Image Captioning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.03743, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described clearly and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
