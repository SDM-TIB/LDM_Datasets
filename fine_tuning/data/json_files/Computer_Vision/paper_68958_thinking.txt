To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Estimation of partially known Gaussian graphical models with score-based structural priors" by Martín Sevilla, Antonio G. Marques, and Santiago Segarra, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments or validation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their numerical experiments. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any specific attributes relevant to the study.

In this paper, the authors mention using various datasets, including:

1. **Grid Graphs**: The authors generated graphs with 40 nodes and added random edges to create a dataset for their experiments. They specify that they generated 5000 graphs for training.

2. **Barabási–Albert Graphs**: The authors describe using a dual Barabási–Albert model for generating graphs, indicating that they created 1000 graphs for testing their algorithm.

3. **Ego-Nets from Deezer Dataset**: The authors utilized ego-net graphs collected from the music streaming service Deezer, specifically mentioning that they used 2926 graphs for training and 100 for testing.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to these datasets. However, since the datasets are generated or specific to the study, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. In such cases, I will note the details provided in the paper itself.

For the datasets identified, I will compile the following information:

- **Dataset Name**: A clear name for each dataset.
- **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and characteristics.
- **Citation**: If applicable, I will provide the full citation for any referenced datasets or note that the datasets are generated for the study.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is organized and ready for downstream processing or review, maintaining clarity and accuracy in the dataset descriptions.
