To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Texture Aware Autoencoder Pre-training And Pairwise Learning Refinement For Improved Iris Recognition" by Manashi Chakraborty et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their model across three publicly available iris datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **ND-Iris-0405**: This dataset contains a total of 64,980 images from 356 subjects (712 classes). The authors specify how the images are split for training and testing.

2. **CASIA.v4-Interval**: This dataset is a subset of the CASIA.v4-Iris dataset, comprising 2,639 images from 249 subjects (498 classes). The authors describe the training and testing splits for this dataset as well.

3. **IITD Iris Database**: This database includes 2,240 images from 224 subjects (448 classes), with details on how the training and testing sets are organized.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **ND-Iris-0405**, the citation is:
  > Phillips, P.J., Boyer, K.W., Flynn, P.J., O’Toole, A.J., Phillips, P.J., Schott, C.L., Scruggs, W.T., Sharpe, M. (2007). Frvt 2006 and ice 2006 large-scale results.

- For **CASIA.v4-Interval**, the citation is:
  > CASIA.v4-Iris-Database: Available at: http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/china/Iris%20Databases%20CH.asp

- For **IITD Iris Database**, the citation is:
  > Kumar, A., Passi, A. (2010). Comparison and combination of iris matchers for reliable personal authentication. Pattern Recognition, 43(3), 1016–1026.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
