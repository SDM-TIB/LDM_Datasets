To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OpenVIS: Open-vocabulary Video Instance Segmentation" by Pinxue Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a framework called InstFormer and mention an evaluation benchmark that utilizes readily available datasets. This suggests that datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation benchmark section** (which is likely in the methodology or experiments section) to find specific datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their model on **YouTube-VIS, BURST, LVVIS, and UVO datasets**. I will note these datasets and look for detailed descriptions.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide context for each dataset:
1. **YouTube-VIS**: A widely-used dataset for video instance segmentation that contains 40 categories.
2. **BURST**: A benchmark dataset that includes 482 categories, with a focus on both common and uncommon categories.
3. **LVVIS**: A dataset that contains 555 unseen categories, specifically designed for evaluating zero-shot capabilities.
4. **UVO**: A dataset that provides an average of 13.52 instances annotated per video, suitable for measuring open-world properties.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

The citations I find are:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
