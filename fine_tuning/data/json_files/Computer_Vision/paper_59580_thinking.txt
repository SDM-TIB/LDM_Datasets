To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DiffuMask: Synthesizing Images with Pixel-level Annotations for Semantic Segmentation Using Diffusion Models" by Weijia Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate the ability to generate synthetic images with pixel-level annotations, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in their experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of collecting and annotating images for semantic segmentation and mention existing datasets like **Cityscapes** and **VOC 2012**. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the experiments, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their method on **Pascal-VOC 2012**, **Cityscapes**, and **ADE20K** datasets. This confirms that these datasets are utilized for their evaluations.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each of these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **Pascal-VOC 2012**:
   > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2):303–338, 2010.

2. **Cityscapes**:
   > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3213–3223, 2016.

3. **ADE20K**:
   > Bolei Zhou, Hang Zhao, Xavier Puig, Sanja Fidler, Adela Barriuso, and Antonio Torralba. *Scene Parsing Through ADE20K Dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 633–641, 2017.

After collecting the dataset names and their citations, I will ensure that I accurately represent each dataset's details, including their purpose and any relevant characteristics mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its full citation.
