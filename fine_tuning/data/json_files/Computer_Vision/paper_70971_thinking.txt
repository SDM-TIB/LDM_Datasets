To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal Flow Matching: Learning Straight Trajectories in Just One Step" by Nikita Kornilov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets or benchmarks used in the experiments. 

Upon reviewing Section 4, I find that the authors discuss their experiments but do not explicitly name any datasets in the main text. Therefore, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited there, as authors often refer to datasets by their original papers.

In the references, I will look for any entries that seem to correspond to datasets. For example, if the authors mention using a specific benchmark or dataset in their experiments, I will find the corresponding citation in the references.

After reviewing the references, I identify the following datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **Wasserstein-2 Benchmark**: This benchmark is referenced in the context of evaluating the performance of the proposed method. The citation for this benchmark is:
   > Alexander Korotin, Lingxiao Li, Aude Genevay, Justin M Solomon, Alexander Filippov, and Evgeny Burnaev. *Do neural optimal transport solvers work? A continuous Wasserstein-2 benchmark*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 34:14593–14605, 2021.

2. **ALAE Dataset**: The authors mention using the ALAE autoencoder for unpaired image-to-image translation. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Stanislav Pidhorskyi, Donald A Adjeroh, and Gianfranco Doretto. *Adversarial latent autoencoders*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 14104–14113, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I have extracted the following datasets from the paper:

1. **Wasserstein-2 Benchmark**: 
   - Citation: Alexander Korotin, Lingxiao Li, Aude Genevay, Justin M Solomon, Alexander Filippov, and Evgeny Burnaev. *Do neural optimal transport solvers work? A continuous Wasserstein-2 benchmark*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 34:14593–14605, 2021.

2. **ALAE Dataset**: 
   - Citation: Stanislav Pidhorskyi, Donald A Adjeroh, and Gianfranco Doretto. *Adversarial latent autoencoders*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 14104–14113, 2020.

This methodical approach ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the research paper.
