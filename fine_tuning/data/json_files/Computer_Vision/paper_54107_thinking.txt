To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Visual Transformer for Object Detection" by Michael Yang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on the COCO dataset, which suggests that this dataset is significant to their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, they detail the datasets as follows:

1. **COCO 2017 Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as consisting of over 5000 training and validation images and 5000 test images with over 20 object categories. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, as they evaluate their model's performance on it.

2. **ImageNet**: This dataset is mentioned as a large-scale dataset consisting of more than 10 million images with labels. The authors use it for pretraining their model.

3. **JFT Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as even larger, containing over 300 million images. It is also used for pretraining the model.

In the **References section**, I will look for the full citations for these datasets:

- For **COCO 2017 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., and Zitnick, C. L. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In ECCV, 2014.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., and Fei-Fei, L. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 248–255, 2009. doi: 10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206848.

- For **JFT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sun, C., Shrivastava, A., Singh, S., and Gupta, A. *Revisiting Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data in Deep Learning Era*. In 2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 843–852, 2017. doi: 10.1109/ICCV.2017.97.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
