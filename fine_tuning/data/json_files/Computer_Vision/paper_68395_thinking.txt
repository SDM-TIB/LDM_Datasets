To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DHGCN: Dynamic Hop Graph Convolution Network for Self-Supervised Point Cloud Learning" by Jincen Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on various datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified. I will look for specific names of datasets mentioned in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **experimental results** section, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using **ShapeNet** and **ModelNet40** for pretraining and downstream tasks. I will note these datasets and look for any additional details provided about them.

In the **pretraining** section, the authors specify that **ShapeNet** consists of 57,448 models across 55 categories, and **ModelNet40** contains 9,840 training models for 3D object classification. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope and usage.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For **ShapeNet**, the citation is:
> Chang, A. X., Funkhouser, T., Guibas, L., Hanrahan, P., Huang, Q., Li, Z., Savarese, S., Savva, M., Song, S., Su, H., et al. (2015). *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012.

For **ModelNet40**, the citation is:
> Wu, Z., Song, S., Khosla, A., Yu, F., Zhang, L., Tang, X., & Xiao, J. (2015). *3D ShapeNets: A deep representation for volumetric shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 1912â€“1920.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, details, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
