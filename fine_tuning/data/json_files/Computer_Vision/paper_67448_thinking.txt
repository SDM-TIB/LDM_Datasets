To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ConVRT: Consistent Video Restoration Through Turbulence with Test-time Optimization of Neural Video Representations" by Haoming Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of atmospheric turbulence and mentions a self-supervised method, but does not specify datasets. The introduction elaborates on the need for effective turbulence mitigation but does not provide dataset names either.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Training Details)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they state that they adopt subsets of the **BVI-CLEAR dataset** and the **TSR-WGAN dataset** for their evaluations. This is a crucial finding as it directly identifies the datasets relevant to their research.

I will then look for additional details about these datasets within the same section. The authors mention that these datasets feature real-world turbulence and clean videos, which is important context for understanding their application in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. For the **BVI-CLEAR dataset**, the citation is:
   > Nantheera Anantrasirichai. *Atmospheric turbulence removal with complex-valued convolutional neural network*. Pattern Recognition Letters, 171:69–75, 2023.

2. For the **TSR-WGAN dataset**, the citation is:
   > Darui Jin, Ying Chen, Yi Lu, Junzhang Chen, Peng Wang, Zichao Liu, Sheng Guo, and Xiangzhi Bai. *Neutralizing the impact of atmospheric turbulence on complex scene imaging via deep learning*. Nature Machine Intelligence, 3(10):876–884, 2021.

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
