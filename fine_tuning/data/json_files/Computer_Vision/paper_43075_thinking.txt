To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Animatable Reconstruction of Clothed Humans" by Zeng Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not list datasets explicitly, it sets the context for the experiments. The introduction often contains references to datasets used in the study, so I will pay close attention to any mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe their methodology and the datasets used for training and testing. In this section, the authors mention that their training dataset consists of 375 3D scans from the **RenderPeople** dataset and 207 3D scans from the **AXYZ** dataset. They also specify that their test dataset includes 64 scans from the **RenderPeople** dataset, 207 scans from the **AXYZ** dataset, 26 scans from the **BUFF** dataset, and 2D images from the **DeepFashion** dataset.

Now, I will gather the necessary details for each dataset:

1. **RenderPeople Dataset**: This dataset is used for both training and testing. It consists of 3D scans of clothed individuals, which are watertight meshes and mostly free of noise.

2. **AXYZ Dataset**: Similar to the RenderPeople dataset, this dataset contains 3D scans of clothed individuals and is used for training.

3. **BUFF Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as part of the test dataset, containing additional scans for evaluation.

4. **DeepFashion Dataset**: This dataset is used for testing and consists of 2D images representing clothed individuals.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

After gathering the citations, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format, ready for review or further processing. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
