To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Kernelized Dense Layers for Facial Expression Recognition" by M. Amine Mahmoudi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on three datasets: RAF, FER2013, and ExpW. This is a strong indication that these datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list and describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they provide the following details:

1. **RAF-DB**: The Real-world Affective Face DataBase, which contains 29,672 diverse facial images.
2. **ExpW**: The EXPression in-the-Wild dataset, consisting of 91,793 facial images.
3. **FER2013**: This dataset was introduced during the ICML 2013 Challenges in Representation Learning and includes 28,709 training images, 3,589 validation images, and 3,589 test images.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **RAF-DB**, the citation is:
  > Shan Li, Weihong Deng, and JunPing Du. "Reliable crowdsourcing and deep locality-preserving learning for expression recognition in the wild." In *Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017 IEEE Conference on*, pp. 2584–2593, 2017.

- For **ExpW**, the citation is:
  > Zhanpeng Zhang, Ping Luo, Chen Change Loy, and Xiaoou Tang. "From facial expression recognition to interpersonal relation prediction." *International Journal of Computer Vision*, Springer, vol. 126, no. 5, pp. 550–569, 2018.

- For **FER2013**, the citation is:
  > Ian J. Goodfellow, Dumitru Erhan, Pierre Luc Carrier, Aaron Courville, Mehdi Mirza, Ben Hamner, Will Cukierski, Yichuan Tang, David Thaler, Dong-Hyun Lee, et al. "Challenges in representation learning: A report on three machine learning contests." In *International Conference on Neural Information Processing*, Springer, pp. 117–124, 2013.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
