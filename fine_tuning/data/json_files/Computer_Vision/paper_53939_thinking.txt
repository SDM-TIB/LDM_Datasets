To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Meta-learning with Sampling Noise and Label Noise via Eigen-Reptile" by Dong Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of few-shot learning (FSL) and mentions experiments conducted on various benchmark datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (Section 5), where the authors typically provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **Mini-Imagenet**: This dataset is described as containing 100 classes, each with 600 images. The authors follow a specific protocol for dividing the dataset into meta-training, meta-validation, and meta-testing sets.

2. **CIFAR-FS**: This dataset is referenced as another benchmark for few-shot learning, although specific details about its structure are not provided in the same depth as Mini-Imagenet.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of these datasets:

- For **Mini-Imagenet**, the citation is:
  > Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T., Wierstra, D., et al. *Matching networks for one shot learning*. In Advances in neural information processing systems, pp. 3630–3638, 2016.

- For **CIFAR-FS**, the citation is:
  > Bertinetto, L., Henriques, J. F., Torr, P. H., and Vedaldi, A. *Meta-learning with differentiable closed-form solvers*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.08136, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. Mini-Imagenet
   - Citation: Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T., Wierstra, D., et al. *Matching networks for one shot learning*. In Advances in neural information processing systems, pp. 3630–3638, 2016.
   
2. CIFAR-FS
   - Citation: Bertinetto, L., Henriques, J. F., Torr, P. H., and Vedaldi, A. *Meta-learning with differentiable closed-form solvers*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.08136, 2018.

With this information, I am ready to proceed with any further tasks related to these datasets.
