To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extremely Lightweight Quantization Robust Real-Time Single-Image Super Resolution for Mobile Devices" by Mustafa Ayazoglu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on the **Div2K Dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset used. They mention that they used the **Div2K Dataset** for the challenge, which consists of 800 high-quality training images, 100 validation images, and 100 test images. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides details about its composition.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Div2K Dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> Eirikur Agustsson and Radu Timofte. *Ntire 2017 challenge on single image super-resolution: Dataset and study*. In IEEE Conf. Comput. Vis. Pattern Recog. Worksh., July 2017.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets used for evaluation or comparison, I will focus solely on the Div2K Dataset for my extraction.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details for the dataset mentioned in the paper.
