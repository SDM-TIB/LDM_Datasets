To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Class Representative Autoencoder for Low Resolution Multi-Spectral Gender Classification" by Maneet Singh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets section** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often highlights the significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **Section III (Datasets and Experimental Protocol)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets utilized in their experiments. This section typically contains detailed information about each dataset, including the number of images, subjects, and any specific characteristics relevant to the study.

In this paper, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **CMU Multi-PIE Dataset**: This dataset includes images of 337 subjects captured under various conditions. The authors specify that they used a frontal subset containing 50,248 images, with a training set of 18,420 images and a test set of 31,828 images.

2. **PolyU-NIR Dataset**: This dataset consists of 34,000 near-infrared (NIR) spectrum face images of 335 subjects. The authors indicate that they used 9,960 images for training (4,980 per class) and the remaining images for testing.

3. **SCface Dataset**: This dataset contains visible and NIR images of 130 subjects captured at different distances. The authors specify that they used 100 images for training and 550 for testing in the visible spectrum, and a smaller number for the NIR spectrum.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **CMU Multi-PIE Dataset**:
  > Gross, R., Matthews, I., Cohn, J., Kanade, T., & Baker, S. (2010). Multi-PIE. *Image Vision Computing*, 28(5), 807-813.

- For **PolyU-NIR Dataset**:
  > Zhang, B., Zhang, L., Zhang, D., & Shen, L. (2010). Directional binary code with application to PolyU Near-infrared Face Database. *Pattern Recognition Letters*, 31(14), 2337-2344.

- For **SCface Dataset**:
  > Grgic, M., Delac, K., & Grgic, S. (2011). SCface - Surveillance Cameras Face Database. *Multimedia Tools Application*, 51(3), 863-879.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
