To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Simple Data Mixing Prior for Improving Self-Supervised Learning" by Sucheng Ren et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of data mixing in self-supervised learning but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, which is likely to contain details about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention evaluating their method on standard visual benchmarks, specifically **ImageNet** and **CIFAR-10/100**. This indicates that these datasets are used in their experiments.

I will then look for specific details about these datasets in the text. The paper mentions:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset commonly used for image classification tasks. It contains millions of labeled images across thousands of categories.
2. **CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100**: These are smaller datasets containing 60,000 images each, with CIFAR-10 having 10 classes and CIFAR-100 having 100 classes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255, 2009.

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **ImageNet** - A large-scale image classification dataset.
2. **CIFAR-10** - A dataset with 10 classes and 60,000 images.
3. **CIFAR-100** - A dataset with 100 classes and 60,000 images.

I will ensure to include the full citations for each dataset in any subsequent documentation or output.
