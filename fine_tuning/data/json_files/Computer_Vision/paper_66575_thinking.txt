To extract datasets from the research paper titled "D-SCo: Dual-Stream Conditional Diffusion for Monocular Hand-Held Object Reconstruction" by Bowen Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on several datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific dataset names.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of reconstructing hand-held objects and mention the need for real-world data. This suggests that they likely used multiple datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **ObMan Dataset**: A synthetic dataset consisting of 2,772 objects from 8 categories, with 141K frames for training and 6K frames for testing. The dataset is rendered using Blender on random backgrounds.

2. **HO3D Dataset**: This dataset includes 77,558 frames from 68 sequences, containing 10 different objects manipulated by various users. The hand and object pose annotations are obtained from multi-camera optimization.

3. **MOW Dataset**: Comprising 442 images of 121 object templates, this dataset is collected from in-the-wild sources, including EPIC Kitchens and the 100 Days of Hands datasets.

4. **DexYCB Dataset**: A large-scale real-world hand-object dataset with 29,656 training samples and 5,928 testing samples, focusing on right-hand samples.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I found are:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
