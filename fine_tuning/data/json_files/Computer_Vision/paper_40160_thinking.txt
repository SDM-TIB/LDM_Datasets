To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SLSNet: Skin lesion segmentation using a lightweight generative adversarial network" by Md. Mostafa Kamal Sarker et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that SLSNet is evaluated on two publicly available datasets: **ISBI 2017** and **ISIC 2018**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will check the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about these datasets. The introduction does not provide further specifics but confirms the use of these datasets for skin lesion segmentation.

I will then look into the **experiments** section, specifically where the datasets are discussed. In the experiments section, the authors mention that the ISBI 2017 dataset was divided into training, validation, and testing sets, and the ISIC 2018 dataset includes images with corresponding ground truth masks annotated by expert dermatologists. This reinforces the importance of these datasets in their evaluation.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **ISBI 2017 Dataset**:
   > Codella, N., Rotemberg, V., Tschandl, P., Celebi, M.E., et al. (2019). Skin lesion analysis toward melanoma detection 2018: A challenge hosted by the international skin imaging collaboration (ISIC). *arXiv:1902.03368*.

2. **ISIC 2018 Dataset**:
   > ISIC. (2018). Skin lesion analysis towards melanoma detection. Retrieved from https://challenge2018.isic-archive.com/live-leaderboards/.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now compile this information into a structured format for further use. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, which is essential for proper attribution in any subsequent analysis or application.
