To extract datasets from the research paper titled "xCos: An Explainable Cosine Metric for Face Verification Task" by Yu-Sheng Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of **LFW** and various competitive benchmarks, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Implementation Details)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for training and testing. Here, they mention:

1. **MS1M-ArcFace**: This dataset is used as training data.
2. **LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild)**: This dataset is used for testing.
3. **AgeDB-30**: Another testing dataset mentioned.
4. **CFP (Celebrities in Frontal and Profile)**: Also used for testing.
5. **CALFW**: Mentioned as a testing dataset.
6. **VGG2-FP**: Another dataset used for testing.
7. **AR database**: Included in the testing datasets.
8. **YTF (YouTube Faces)**: Also mentioned as a testing dataset.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **LFW**, the citation is:
  > Gary B. Huang, Manu Ramesh, Tamara Berg, and Erik Learned-Miller. *Labeled Faces in the Wild: A Database for Studying Face Recognition in Unconstrained Environments*. Technical Report 07-49, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, 2007.

- For **MS1M-ArcFace**, the citation is:

- For **AgeDB-30**, the citation is:

- For **CFP**, the citation is:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations for further processing or review.
