To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LLM Blueprint: Enabling Text-to-Image Generation with Complex and Detailed Prompts" by Hanan Gani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "multi-modal datasets," which suggests that datasets are indeed involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the advancements in text-to-image generation and the challenges faced by existing models. They reference the need for large-scale datasets but do not specify any particular datasets yet.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe their approach and mention using textual descriptions from COCO and PASCAL images. This is a crucial point, as it indicates that these datasets are part of their experimental setup.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. Here, the authors state that they use textual descriptions from COCO (Lin et al., 2014) and PASCAL (Everingham et al., 2010) images. This confirms that these datasets are utilized in their research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. **COCO Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V 13, pp. 740–755. Springer, 2014.

2. **PASCAL Dataset**: The citation is:
   > M. Everingham, L. Van Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2):303–338, June 2010.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ready for structured output or further processing.
