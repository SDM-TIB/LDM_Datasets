To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised detection of mouse behavioural anomalies using two-stream convolutional autoencoders" by Ezechukwu I Nwokedi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors used a publicly available dataset containing twelve videos of home-caged mice with frame-level annotations. This suggests that there is a dataset to extract.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the dataset. The introduction mentions that the dataset contains videos of mice with annotations for eight different behaviours, which provides more context about the dataset's content.

I will then look into the **methods** section, particularly the **Data & pre-processing** subsection, where the authors describe the dataset in more detail. They specify that the dataset consists of twelve videos, over 10 hours in length, and includes annotations for behaviours such as drink, eat, groom, hang, rear, rest, micromovement, and walk. This section confirms the dataset's structure and purpose.

Additionally, I will check the **results** section to see if the authors mention any other datasets used for comparison. They reference the **CUHK Avenue dataset** as a benchmark for testing their models, which is another dataset to include.

Finally, I will consult the **References section** to gather full citations for both datasets mentioned:

1. For the dataset of mouse behaviours, the citation is:
   > Hueihan Jhuang, Estibaliz Garrote, Xinlin Yu, Vinita Khilnani, Tomaso Poggio, Andrew D Steele, and Thomas Serre. *Automated home-cage behavioural phenotyping of mice*. Nature communications, 1(1):1–10, 2010.

2. For the CUHK Avenue dataset, the citation is:
   > Cewu Lu, Jianping Shi, and Jiaya Jia. *Abnormal event detection at 150 fps in matlab*. In Proceedings of the IEEE international conference on computer vision, pages 2720–2727, 2013.

Now, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
