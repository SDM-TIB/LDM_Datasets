To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Clinical Diagnosis: Automated Stroke Lesion Segmentation on Multimodal MR Image Using Convolutional Neural Network" by Zhiyang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validated their method on a dataset of **212 clinically acquired multi-modal MR images**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors mention that they collected clinical data from **212 ischemic stroke patients** from Nankai University affiliated Tianjin Huanhu Hospital. They specify that **115 patients were used for training** and **97 for testing**. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's composition.

I will also check the **dataset description** in the methods section, where the authors describe the MRI acquisition process and the types of images included. They mention using **DWI, ADC, and T2-weighted images (T2WI)**, which are critical for the segmentation task.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is based on clinical data collected by the authors, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: Clinical dataset of ischemic stroke patients
- **Description**: Contains 212 multi-modal MR images (DWI, ADC, T2WI) from ischemic stroke patients, with 115 used for training and 97 for testing.
- **Source**: Collected from Nankai University affiliated Tianjin Huanhu Hospital.

Since this dataset is not a publicly available one with a formal citation, I will document the details as provided in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
