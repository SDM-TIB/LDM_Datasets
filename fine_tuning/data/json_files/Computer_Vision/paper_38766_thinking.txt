To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quadratic Autoencoder (Q-AE) for Low-dose CT Denoising" by Fenglei Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **Mayo low-dose CT dataset** for evaluating the proposed quadratic autoencoder. This indicates that a dataset is explicitly referenced, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors state that they used the **Mayo low-dose CT dataset**, which is confirmed later in the paper. I will need to gather more details about this dataset, such as its size, characteristics, and how it was used in the experiments.

In the **experimental setting section**, the authors provide specific details about the dataset: they extracted **74,000 patches** from the Mayo low-dose CT challenge dataset, with **64,000** used for training and **10,000** for validation. This information is crucial for describing the dataset comprehensively.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Mayo low-dose CT dataset. The citation typically includes the authors, title, publication venue, and year. If the dataset is part of a larger study or challenge, I will ensure to include that context in the citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details into a structured format, ensuring to include:

1. **Dataset Name**: Mayo low-dose CT dataset
2. **Description**: Contains 74,000 64x64 patches extracted from low-dose CT images, with 64,000 patches for training and 10,000 for validation.
3. **Full Citation**: I will format the citation based on the reference list in the paper.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is clear, concise, and accurately reflects the information provided in the paper. This will allow for easy reference and understanding of the dataset used in the research.
