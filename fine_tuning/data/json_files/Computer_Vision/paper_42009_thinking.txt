To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Paraphrase Generation with Latent Bag of Words" by Yao Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used. In this case, the authors mention using datasets for experiments, which indicates that I should look for specific names and descriptions.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Quora Dataset**: This dataset is used for duplicated question detection, where duplicated questions are labeled by human annotators and guaranteed to be paraphrases. The authors state that they have 50K training instances and 20K testing instances, with a vocabulary size of 8K.

2. **MSCOCO Dataset**: Originally developed for image captioning, this dataset contains images associated with 5 different captions. The authors explain that they use one caption as the source and the content words from the other four as their bag of words (BOW) objective. They report having 94K training instances and 23K testing instances, with a vocabulary size of 11K.

To confirm the details, I will also check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets:

- For the **Quora Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Quora. *Quora Duplicate Questions Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/aymenmouelhi/quora-duplicate-questions.

- For the **MSCOCO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge J. Belongie, Lubomir D. Bourdev, Ross B. Girshick, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Doll√°r, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In ECCV, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
