To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ClusterEA: Scalable Entity Alignment with Stochastic Training and Normalized Mini-batch Similarities" by Yunjun Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted with real-life datasets on entity alignment benchmarks, indicating that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **IDS**: This dataset contains four cross-lingual datasets, specifically:
   - IDS15K_EN-FR
   - IDS100K_EN-FR
   - IDS15K_EN-DE
   - IDS100K_EN-DE

2. **DBP1M**: This is described as the largest cross-lingual EA benchmark, which includes:
   - DBP1M_EN-FR
   - DBP1M_EN-DE

The paper provides detailed statistics about these datasets, including the number of entities, relations, and triples, which confirms their relevance and importance in the context of the research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are typically included in the references for the original sources of the datasets. 

For the **IDS datasets**, the citation is:
> Zeng, W., Zhao, X., Tang, J., & Lin, X. (2020). A Benchmarking Study of Embedding-based Entity Alignment for Knowledge Graphs. *PVLDB*, 13(11), 2326-2340.

For the **DBP1M dataset**, the citation is:
> Auer, S., Bizer, C., Kobilarov, G., Lehmann, J., Cyganiak, R., & Ives, Z. G. (2007). DBpedia: A Nucleus for a Web of Open Data. In *ISWC* (pp. 722-735).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and use in future work.
