To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Look ATME: The Discriminator Mean Entropy Needs Attention" by Edgardo Solano-Carrillo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the introduction of a new model for image-to-image translation and hints at the use of standard datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their work. In this section, they mention four datasets for supervised image-to-image translation: **Facades**, **Maps**, **Cityscapes**, and **Night2day**. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets, including their specific characteristics and how they are utilized in the experiments.

The paper includes a **Table 1** that summarizes the datasets, indicating the types of images paired for translation tasks. This table will be crucial for understanding the context in which each dataset is used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The authors reference the original paper that introduced the **pix2pix** framework, which is foundational for the datasets mentioned. The citation for the pix2pix paper is:

- For **Facades, Maps, Cityscapes, and Night2day datasets**, the citation is:
  > Phillip Isola, Jun-Yan Zhu, Tinghui Zhou, and Alexei A. Efros. *Image-to-image translation with conditional adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2017.

This citation covers all four datasets since they are commonly associated with the pix2pix framework.

Now, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for further processing or review.
