To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DEX-TTS: Diffusion-based EXpressive Text-to-Speech with Style Modeling on Time Variability" by Hyun Joon Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **multi-speaker and emotional multi-speaker datasets**, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will note this down as a starting point.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In **Section 4.1**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **VCTK Dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately 400 utterances per 109 speakers and is used for multi-speaker TTS. The authors specify that they split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets based on speakers.

2. **Emotional Speech Dataset (ESD)**: This dataset contains 10 English and 10 Chinese speakers, with 400 sentences per speaker across five emotions (happy, sad, neutral, surprise, and angry). The authors also mention that they use a similar split ratio as the VCTK dataset.

To confirm the details, I will check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets:

- For the **VCTK Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Junichi Yamagishi, Christophe Veaux, and Kirsten MacDonald. *CSTR VCTK Corpus: English multi-speaker corpus for CSTR voice cloning toolkit (version 0.92)*. In University of Edinburgh. The Centre for Speech Technology Research (CSTR), 2019.

- For the **Emotional Speech Dataset (ESD)**, the citation is:
  > Kun Zhou, Berrak Sisman, Rui Liu, and Haizhou Li. *Seen and unseen emotional style transfer for voice conversion with a new emotional speech dataset*. In ICASSP 2021-2021 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 920â€“924. IEEE, 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
