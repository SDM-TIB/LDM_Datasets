To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discretizing Numerical Attributes: An Analysis of Human Perceptions" by Minakshi Kaushik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the analysis of human perceptions regarding numerical attribute partitioning, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Design)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention several datasets, including:

1. **DC Public Government Employees Dataset**: This dataset contains 33,424 records of DC public government employees and their salaries in 2011. It is sourced from the Washington Times via Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.

2. **Heart Disease Dataset**: This dataset has 13 attributes and 303 records, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

3. **New Jersey School Teacher Salaries Dataset**: This dataset contains 138,715 records and 15 attributes, focusing on the columns for experience and salary. The authors used only the initial 23,000 rows from this dataset.

The authors also mention that these datasets are available in a GitHub repository, which is a useful reference for accessing the data.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **DC Public Government Employees Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kalish, M. (2011). *DC public employee salaries*. Retrieved from https://data.world/codefordc/dc-public-employee-salaries-2011.

- For the **Heart Disease Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Janosi, A., Steinbrunn, W., Pfisterer, M., & Detrano, R. (1988). *Heart Disease*. UCI Machine Learning Repository.

- For the **New Jersey School Teacher Salaries Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Naik, S. (2016). *New Jersey teacher salaries (2016)*. Retrieved from https://data.world/sheilnaik/nj-teacher-salaries-2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
