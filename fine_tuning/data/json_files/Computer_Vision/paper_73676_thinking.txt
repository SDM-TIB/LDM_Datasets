To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unified Directly Denoising for Both Variance Preserving and Variance Exploding Diffusion Models" by Jingjing Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their method using the **CIFAR-10 benchmark dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely to be important for their evaluation.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors state that they trained several uDDDMs on **CIFAR-10** and compared their performance with competing methods. This confirms that CIFAR-10 is indeed the dataset used for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The citation for CIFAR-10 is:

- **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: 
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the CIFAR-10 dataset for its experiments, I will compile this information into a structured format.

Now, I will create an entry for the CIFAR-10 dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will be the only dataset extracted from this paper, as it is the primary focus of the experiments.

After gathering all necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
