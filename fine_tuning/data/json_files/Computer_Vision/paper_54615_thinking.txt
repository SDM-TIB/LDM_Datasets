To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AutoMerge: A Framework for Map Assembling and Smoothing in City-scale Environments" by Peng Yin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method on both the **KITTI dataset** and their own **Pittsburgh** and **Campus datasets**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section, which is often where authors describe the datasets used in their research. In this paper, there is a section titled **VII. DATASETS AND CRITERIA**. Here, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets they used:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: This is a well-known dataset for autonomous driving, specifically designed for evaluating visual odometry and SLAM algorithms. The authors mention extracting 10 trajectories from the KITTI odometry dataset, totaling around 15 km.

2. **Pittsburgh Dataset**: This dataset was collected within the city of Pittsburgh using a specific data-collection platform. It includes 50 trajectories covering a total distance of 120 km and contains 158 overlaps.

3. **Campus Dataset**: This dataset was recorded at Carnegie Mellon University and consists of 10 main trajectories, each recorded 8 times under different conditions, totaling around 36 km.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References** section to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For the **KITTI Dataset**:
  > Geiger, A., Lenz, P., Stiller, C., & Urtasun, R. (2013). Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset. *The International Journal of Robotics Research*, 32(11), 1231-1237.

- For the **Pittsburgh Dataset** and **Campus Dataset**, since they are self-recorded datasets, I will note that they do not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. However, I will still document their descriptions as provided in the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the KITTI dataset and appropriate descriptions for the Pittsburgh and Campus datasets.

Finally, I will prepare the structured output for these datasets, ready for any further processing or review.
