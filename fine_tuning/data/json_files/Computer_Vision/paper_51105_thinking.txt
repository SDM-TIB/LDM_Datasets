To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NeuSample: Neural Sample Field for Efficient View Synthesis" by Jiemin Fang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention performing experiments on **Realistic Synthetic 360°** and **Real Forward-Facing**, indicating that these are the datasets used for their evaluations.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (specifically section 4.1) where the authors provide details about the datasets. Here, they describe the **Realistic Synthetic 360° dataset** as consisting of 8 scenes, each with 100 training views and 200 testing views, and the **Real Forward-Facing dataset** as containing 8 complex real-world scenes with varying numbers of images.

I will also look at the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are commonly used benchmarks in the field, they may not have specific citations provided in the paper. Instead, I will note the original sources for these datasets based on common knowledge in the field:

1. **Realistic Synthetic 360° Dataset**: This dataset is often associated with the NeRF paper and is used for evaluating novel view synthesis methods. The original source is:
   > Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P. Srinivasan, Rodrigo Ortiz-Cayon, Nima Khademi Kalantari, Ravi Ramamoorthi, Ren Ng, and Abhishek Kar. *Local Light Field Fusion: Practical View Synthesis with Prescriptive Sampling Guidelines*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (Proceedings of SIGGRAPH), 2019.

2. **Real Forward-Facing Dataset**: This dataset is also linked to the NeRF framework and is used for testing methods on real-world scenes. The citation is:
   > Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P. Srinivasan, Matthew Tancik, Jonathan T. Barron, Ravi Ramamoorthi, and Ren Ng. *NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis*. In ECCV, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
