To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SubGDiff: A Subgraph Diffusion Model to Improve Molecular Representation Learning" by Jiying Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly section 5, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details about their usage in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **PCQM4Mv2 Dataset**: This dataset is described as a sub-dataset of PubChemQC, containing 3.4 million molecules with 3D geometric conformations. It is used for pretraining the model.

2. **MD17 Dataset**: This dataset comprises eight molecular dynamics simulations focused on small organic molecules. It is used for various molecular property prediction tasks.

3. **GEOM-QM9 Dataset**: This dataset includes quantum chemistry structures and properties of 134,000 molecules, which is utilized for evaluating the performance of the proposed model in molecular conformation generation.

4. **GEOM-Drugs Dataset**: This dataset contains larger drug-like compounds and is used to assess the generative ability of the diffusion models.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and use in future research or applications.
