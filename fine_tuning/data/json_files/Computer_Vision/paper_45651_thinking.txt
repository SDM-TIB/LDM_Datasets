To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Text Classification through Glyph-aware Disentangled Character Embedding and Semantic Sub-character Augmentation" by Takumi Aoki et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the framework and mentions evaluating it on Japanese text classification tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Evaluation Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Newspaper Dataset**: This dataset consists of 5,610 Japanese major web newspaper articles from sources like Asahi, Mainichi, and Sankei, categorized into politics, economy, and international news, totaling 22,440 articles.

2. **Livedoor Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for evaluating models for Japanese text classification and contains 7,367 articles across nine categories, with examples including 870 sentences in the movie category and 900 in the sports category.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are commonly known datasets in the field. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are widely recognized and can be referenced as follows:

- For the **Newspaper Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Daiki Shimada, Ryunosuke Kotani, and Hitoshi Iyatomi. *Document classification through image-based character embedding and wildcard training*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Big Data Workshop, pages 3922â€“3927, 2016.

- For the **Livedoor Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Livedoor News. *Livedoor News Corpus*. Available at: https://www.rondhuit.com/download.html#ldcc.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
