To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DreamMat: High-quality PBR Material Generation with Geometry- and Light-aware Diffusion Models" by Yuqing Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of generating high-quality appearances for objects and mention the need for datasets with known PBR materials. This indicates that datasets are likely referenced, but I need to locate their specific names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the methodology or experiments sections. In this paper, the authors mention using the **Objaverse dataset** for training their geometry- and light-aware diffusion model. This dataset is crucial for their experiments and results.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Objaverse dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Deitke, M., Schwenk, D., Salvador, J., Weihs, L., Michel, O., Vanderbilt, E., Schmidt, L., Ehsani, K., Kembhavi, A., & Farhadi, A. (2023). Objaverse: A universe of annotated 3D objects. In CVPR.

Additionally, the paper mentions using models sourced from **Sketchfab** under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license. However, since Sketchfab is a platform rather than a specific dataset, I will focus on the Objaverse dataset for citation purposes.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Objaverse dataset. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
