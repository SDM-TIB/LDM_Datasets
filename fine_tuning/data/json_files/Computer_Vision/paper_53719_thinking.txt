To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Difference Learning for Noisy Rigid Image Alignment" by Yu-Xuan Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that experimental results were demonstrated on both nature and cryo-EM images, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention the generation of a synthetic **MS-COCO dataset** for rigid alignment evaluation, which includes details about how the dataset was created, such as the number of image pairs and the types of noise added.

The authors also refer to **real-world cryo-EM datasets**, specifically mentioning **GroEL** and datasets from **EMPIAR**. They describe how synthetic datasets were generated from these sources, including the number of images and the conditions under which they were created.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For the **MS-COCO dataset**, the citation is:
   > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., Zitnick, C.L. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 740–755, 2014. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-10602-1_48

2. For the **GroEL dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ludtke, S.J., Chen, D.H., Song, J.L., Chuang, D.T., Chiu, W. *Seeing GroEL at 6 Å resolution by single particle electron cryomicroscopy*. Structure, 12(7), 1129–1136, 2004. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2004.05.006

3. For the **EMPIAR datasets**, the citation is:
   > Iudin, A., Korir, P.K., Salavert-Torres, J., Kleywegt, G.J., Patwardhan, A. *EMPIAR: a public archive for raw electron microscopy image data*. Nature Methods, 13(5), 387–388, 2016. https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.3806

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
