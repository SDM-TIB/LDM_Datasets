To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion Reconstruction of Ultrasound Images with Informative Uncertainty" by Yuxin Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions conducting experiments on "simulated, in-vitro, and in-vivo data," which indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly the **Training Datasets** and **Validation Datasets** subsections. Here, the authors describe the datasets used for fine-tuning their models and for validation purposes.

In the **Training Datasets** subsection, I find the following datasets:

1. **High-Quality Ultrasound Images**: This dataset consists of images collected from 65-101 plane wave transmissions, used for fine-tuning the diffusion model. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset.

2. **In Vitro Dataset**: The model was fine-tuned on 824 high-quality unpaired in vitro ultrasound images. Again, no specific citation is provided.

3. **In Vivo Dataset**: The model was fine-tuned on a comprehensive dataset consisting of 3551 images (824 in vitro + 1515 in vitro + 1212 in vivo). No citation is provided for this dataset either.

In the **Validation Datasets** subsection, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **PICMUS Dataset**: This dataset is used for quantitative and qualitative evaluation and consists of two simulation sets, two in vitro sets, and two in vivo sets. The authors provide a citation for this dataset:
   > Liebgott, A., Rodriguez-Molares, A., Cervenansky, F., Jensen, J., & Bernard, O. (2016). *Plane-wave imaging challenge in medical ultrasound*. In IEEE IUS.

2. **Additional In Vivo Dataset**: This dataset comprises five distinct sequence sets acquired from the carotid artery of a volunteer. No citation is provided for this dataset.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets where available.

1. **High-Quality Ultrasound Images**: Fine-tuning dataset consisting of images from 65-101 plane wave transmissions. (No citation provided)

2. **In Vitro Dataset**: Fine-tuning dataset consisting of 824 high-quality unpaired in vitro ultrasound images. (No citation provided)

3. **In Vivo Dataset**: Fine-tuning dataset consisting of 3551 images (824 in vitro + 1515 in vitro + 1212 in vivo). (No citation provided)

4. **PICMUS Dataset**: Used for evaluation, consisting of simulation and experimental datasets.
   > Liebgott, A., Rodriguez-Molares, A., Cervenansky, F., Jensen, J., & Bernard, O. (2016). *Plane-wave imaging challenge in medical ultrasound*. In IEEE IUS.

5. **Additional In Vivo Dataset**: Comprising five distinct sequence sets acquired from the carotid artery of a volunteer. (No citation provided)

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
