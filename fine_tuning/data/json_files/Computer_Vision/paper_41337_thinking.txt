To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling Feature Representations for Affective Speech using Generative Adversarial Networks" by Saurabh Sahu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors perform analysis on a dataset of interest and conduct a cross-corpus study, suggesting that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used in their experiments. In **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, they describe two datasets:

1. **IEMOCAP (Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture)**: This dataset consists of five sessions with dyadic affective interactions, totaling approximately 7 hours of data and 5530 utterances labeled for emotions such as happy, sad, angry, excitement, and neutral.

2. **MSP-IMPROV**: This dataset includes actors participating in dyadic conversations across six sessions, with a total of 7798 utterances belonging to the same four emotion classes. The authors note that the class distribution is unbalanced.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of these datasets:

- For **IEMOCAP**, the citation is:
  > Busso, C., Bulut, M., Lee, C.-C., Kazemzadeh, A., Mower, E., Kim, S., Chang, J. N., Lee, S., & Narayanan, S. S. (2008). *IEMOCAP: Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture Database*. Language Resources and Evaluation, 42(4), 335-359.

- For **MSP-IMPROV**, the citation is:
  > Busso, C., Parthasarathy, S., Burmania, A., AbdelWahab, M., Sadoughi, N., & Provost, E. M. (2017). *MSP-IMPROV: An Acted Corpus of Dyadic Interactions to Study Emotion Perception*. IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, 1, 67-80.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
