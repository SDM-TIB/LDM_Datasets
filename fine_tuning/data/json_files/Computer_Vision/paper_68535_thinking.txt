To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LKCA: Large Kernel Convolutional Attention" by Chenghao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. In this section, they mention conducting image classification experiments on four datasets: **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and Tiny-ImageNet**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are used for evaluation.

I will then look for specific details about each dataset in the text. The authors provide the following information:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images.
3. **SVHN (Street View House Numbers)**: A real-world image dataset for digit recognition, consisting of over 600,000 labeled digits.
4. **Tiny-ImageNet**: A smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 100,000 images across 200 classes, with each image resized to 64x64 pixels.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2011.

- For **Tiny-ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Dimitri Papadopoulos, et al. *Tiny ImageNet Challenge*. https://tiny-imagenet.herokuapp.com/.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
