To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic HELM: A Human-Readable Memory for Reinforcement Learning" by Fabian Paischer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method is trained on a set of partially observable environments. This suggests that there are specific datasets used for training and evaluation, which I need to identify.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors describe the environments used for testing their method. They mention four environments: **MiniGrid**, **MiniWorld**, **Avalon**, and **Psychlab**. I will need to gather more details about each of these environments to understand their characteristics and the datasets they represent.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a brief description of each environment:
1. **MiniGrid**: A minimalistic 2D grid-world environment designed for reinforcement learning tasks.
2. **MiniWorld**: A minimalistic 3D environment that includes various tasks for agents to complete.
3. **Avalon**: A 3D survival environment consisting of multiple tasks where agents must survive against predators and gather resources.
4. **Psychlab**: A suite of complex tasks designed to isolate various cognitive faculties of reinforcement learning agents.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for these environments, as they are crucial for proper documentation. The references for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MiniGrid**, the citation is:
  > Chevalier-Boisvert, M., Willems, L., & Pal, S. (2018). Minimalistic Gridworld Environment for OpenAI Gym. GitHub repository.

- For **MiniWorld**, the citation is:
  > Chevalier-Boisvert, M. (2018). MiniWorld: Minimalistic 3D Environment for RL & Robotics Research. GitHub repository.

- For **Avalon**, the citation is:
  > Albrecht, J., Fetterman, A. J., Fogelman, B., Kitanidis, E., Wróblewski, B., Seo, N., Rosenthal, M., Knutins, M., Polizzi, Z., Simon, J. B., & Qiu, K. (2022). Avalon: A benchmark for RL generalization using procedurally generated worlds. CoRR, abs/2210.13417.

- For **Psychlab**, the citation is:
  > Leibo, J. Z., de Masson d’Autume, C., Zoran, D., Amos, D., Beattie, C., Anderson, K., Castañeda, A. G., Sanchez, M., Green, S., Gruslys, A., Legg, S., Hassabis, D., & Botvinick, M. M. (2018). Psychlab: A psychology laboratory for deep reinforcement learning agents. CoRR, abs/1801.08116.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work or analyses.
