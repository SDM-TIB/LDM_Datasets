To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sphere2Vec: A General-Purpose Location Representation Learning over a Spherical Surface for Large-Scale Geospatial Predictions" by Gengchen Mai et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed **20 synthetic datasets** based on the mixture of von Mises-Fisher distributions and conducted experiments on **seven real-world datasets** for geo-aware image classification tasks.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Synthetic Datasets**: The paper states that they constructed **20 synthetic datasets** based on the mixture of von Mises-Fisher distributions. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for these synthetic datasets since they are generated for the purpose of the study.

2. **Real-World Datasets**: The authors conducted experiments on **seven real-world datasets** for three geo-aware image classification tasks. The datasets mentioned include:
   - **BirdSnap**: A dataset about bird species consisting of 500 bird species commonly found in North America.
   - **BirdSnap†**: An enriched version of BirdSnap with simulated locations, dates, and photographers.
   - **NABirds†**: Another dataset about North American bird species with simulated location metadata.
   - **iNat2017**: A dataset used in the iNaturalist 2017 challenges with 5089 unique categories.
   - **iNat2018**: A dataset used in the iNaturalist 2018 challenges with 8142 unique categories.
   - **YFCC**: The Yahoo Flickr Creative Commons 100M dataset, a set of geo-tagged Flickr photos.
   - **fMoW**: The Functional Map of the World dataset, which contains remote sensing images classified into 62 different land use types.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the real-world datasets mentioned in the paper. The citations are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
