To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NeRF-DS: Neural Radiance Fields for Dynamic Specular Objects" by Chen Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model using a self-collected dataset of dynamic specular objects, which suggests that there is a dataset relevant to their research.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention that they collected a new dynamic specular dataset consisting of 8 scenes with various types of moving or deforming specular objects. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including the number of frames and the types of objects included.

The paper specifies that each scene contains two videos captured by two forward-facing cameras, with one camera used for training and the other for testing. The authors also mention that the dataset includes scenes such as "Basin," "Plate," "Sheet," "Sieve," "Bell," "Cup," "Press," and "2 Cups," along with the number of frames for each scene.

Now, I will compile the details of the dataset:

1. **Dynamic Specular Dataset**: This dataset is self-collected by the authors and consists of 8 scenes featuring various dynamic specular objects in realistic environments. Each scene contains two videos captured by two cameras.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, since this dataset is self-collected and not published elsewhere, there may not be a formal citation for it. Instead, I will note that the dataset is described in detail within the paper itself.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation for the paper itself, as it is essential for proper attribution:

- **Dynamic Specular Dataset**: 
  - Description: A dataset consisting of 8 scenes with various types of moving or deforming specular objects in realistic environments. Each scene contains two videos captured by two forward-facing cameras.
  - Scenes: Basin, Plate, Sheet, Sieve, Bell, Cup, Press, 2 Cups.
  - Number of frames: Varies per scene (e.g., Basin: 668 frames, Plate: 424 frames, etc.).

The full citation for the paper is:
> Chen Li, Gim Hee Lee, and Zhiwen Yan. *NeRF-DS: Neural Radiance Fields for Dynamic Specular Objects*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2023.

With this information compiled, I will be ready to format it according to the required structure for further processing or review.
