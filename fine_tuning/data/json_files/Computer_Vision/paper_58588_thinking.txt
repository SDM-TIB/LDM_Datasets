To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PointWavelet: Learning in Spectral Domain for 3D Point Cloud Analysis" by Cheng Wen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on four popular point cloud datasets, which suggests that these datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically section V, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **ModelNet40**: This dataset contains CAD models from 40 categories, with a specific split of 9,843 training and 2,468 testing samples.
2. **ScanObjectNN**: This dataset includes approximately 15,000 real scanned objects categorized into 15 classes, with 2,902 unique object instances.
3. **ShapeNet-Part**: This dataset consists of 16,881 models from 16 shape categories, with a total of 50 different parts labeled. The authors use the official split of 14,006 for training and 2,874 for testing.
4. **S3DIS**: This dataset contains 3D scans from six large-scale indoor areas, including 271 rooms, with each point annotated with a label from 13 semantic classes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **ModelNet40**, the citation is:

- For **ScanObjectNN**, the citation is:

- For **ShapeNet-Part**, the citation is:

- For **S3DIS**, the citation is:

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
