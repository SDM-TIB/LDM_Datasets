To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Minimax Defense against Gradient-based Adversarial Attacks" by Blerta Lindqvist and Rauf Izmailov, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used three datasets: **MNIST**, **CIFAR-10**, and **German Traffic Sign (TRAFFIC)**. This is a good starting point, as it explicitly lists the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments and results section** to gather more details about these datasets. In this section, the authors provide specific information about each dataset, including their characteristics and the number of samples. 

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The paper describes the MNIST dataset as containing handwritten digits with ten classes, consisting of 60,000 training samples and 10,000 testing samples. The images are of size 28 × 28 pixels.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The CIFAR-10 dataset is characterized as a 10-class dataset of objects, with images sized 32 × 32 pixels. It contains 50,000 training samples and 10,000 testing samples.

3. **TRAFFIC Dataset**: The TRAFFIC dataset is mentioned as containing images of traffic signs across 43 classes, with varying sizes from 15 × 15 pixels to 250 × 250 pixels. The authors rescale these images to 32 × 32 pixels for their experiments, and the dataset includes 39,209 training samples and 12,630 testing samples.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher JC Burges. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. 1998. URL: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist.

- For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2009. URL: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/kriz/cifar.html.

- For the **TRAFFIC dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Stallkamp, M. Schlipsing, J. Salmen, and C. Igel. *Man vs. computer: Benchmarking machine learning algorithms for traffic sign recognition*. Neural Networks, 32:–, 2012.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
