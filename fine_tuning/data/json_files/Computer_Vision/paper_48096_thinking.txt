To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SYNSHINE: improved fixing of Syntax Errors" by Toufiq Ahmed et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that "large samples of novice errors and fixes are now available," which suggests that there are datasets related to novice programming errors. I will look for specific names or references to datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** section, particularly where the authors describe their approach and the datasets they utilized. In this section, they mention using the **Blackbox dataset**, which is crucial for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its size and the nature of the data it contains.

I will also check the **evaluation** section, where the authors might discuss the datasets used for testing their model's performance. They mention that they used a dataset of 1.7 million pairs of erroneous and fixed programs from the **Blackbox dataset**. This reinforces the importance of this dataset in their research.

After identifying the datasets, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Blackbox dataset**. The authors reference the original work that introduced this dataset, which is crucial for providing a complete citation.

The citation for the **Blackbox dataset** is:
> N. C. C. Brown, M. Kölling, D. McCall, and I. Utting. *Blackbox: a large scale repository of novice programmers’ activity*. In Proceedings of the 45th ACM technical symposium on Computer science education, pages 223–228, 2014.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Blackbox Dataset**: This dataset contains 1.7 million pairs of erroneous and fixed programs, specifically focused on novice programming errors. It is used extensively in the evaluation of the SYNSHINE tool.

With this information, I will prepare to format the dataset details according to the required structure, ensuring that the full citation is included for clarity and proper attribution.
