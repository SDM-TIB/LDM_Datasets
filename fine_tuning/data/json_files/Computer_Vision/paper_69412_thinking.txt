To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MIGC: Multi-Instance Generation Controller for Text-to-Image Synthesis" by Dewei Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new benchmark called **COCO-MIG**, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used in the experiments. In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on the **COCO-MIG benchmark**, which is based on the **COCO dataset**. This suggests that both datasets are significant for the research.

I will then check the **methodology section** for a detailed description of the **COCO-MIG benchmark**. The authors explain that the COCO-MIG benchmark uses layouts from the **COCO dataset** and assigns specific color attributes to instances. This confirms that the COCO dataset is foundational to their work.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. **COCO Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, Lubomir Bourdev, Ross Girshick, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, C. Lawrence Zitnick, and Piotr Dollár. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755, 2014.

2. **COCO-MIG Benchmark**: Since this is a new benchmark introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:
   > Dewei Zhou, You Li, Fan Ma, Xiaoting Zhang, and Yi Yang. *MIGC: Multi-Instance Generation Controller for Text-to-Image Synthesis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations as required.
