To extract datasets from the research paper titled "2.5D Multi-view Averaging Diffusion Model for 3D Medical Image Translation: Application to Low-count PET Reconstruction with CT-less Attenuation Correction" by Tianqi Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a model for translating low-count PET images, which suggests that datasets related to PET imaging may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, specifically looking for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation. In this section, the authors mention that they collected a real patient dataset from the Yale New Haven Hospital (YNHH) for training and evaluation. This indicates that there is a specific dataset being utilized.

I will also check the **Data Preparation** subsection, where the authors provide details about the dataset. They describe how they acquired PET scans using a Siemens Biograph mCT scanner and mention the number of subjects involved (147 subjects, with 120 for training and 27 for evaluation). This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

The authors specify that they generated low-count PET data at two different levels (5% and 10% down-sampling ratios) and that they used ordered-subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) for reconstruction. This indicates that the dataset is not only real patient data but also includes processed versions of that data.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. However, since the dataset is derived from a specific hospital and not a publicly available dataset, I will note that the dataset is proprietary to Yale New Haven Hospital.

Based on this analysis, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Yale New Haven Hospital PET Dataset**: This dataset consists of PET scans from 147 subjects, with 120 subjects used for training and 27 for evaluation. The scans were performed using a Siemens Biograph mCT scanner, and the dataset includes both low-count and standard-count PET images.

Since the dataset is not publicly available, I will not provide a formal citation but will note its origin.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
