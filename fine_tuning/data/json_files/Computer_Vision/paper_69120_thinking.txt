To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AdvGPS: Adversarial GPS for Multi-Agent Perception Attack" by Jinlong Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on the **OPV2V dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors reference the **OPV2V dataset** as a publicized open-source simulated dataset for V2V perception, collected in CARLA and OpenCDA. This confirms that the OPV2V dataset is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide further details about the OPV2V dataset, including the number of frames used (594 frames) and the specific setting (digital town of Culver City, Los Angeles). This information is essential for describing the dataset comprehensively.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the OPV2V dataset. The citation is as follows:
> R. Xu, H. Xiang, X. Xia, X. Han, J. Li, and J. Ma. "OPV2V: An open benchmark dataset and fusion pipeline for perception with vehicle-to-vehicle communication." In International Conference on Robotics and Automation, IEEE, 2022, pp. 2583â€“2589.

Since the OPV2V dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the OPV2V dataset, ready for any further processing or review.
