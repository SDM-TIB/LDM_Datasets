To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Faster Training of Diffusion Models: An Inspiration of A Consistency Phenomenon" by Tianshuo Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating optimization methods on various models and datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention training their optimized models on **Cifar10** and **ImageNet128** datasets. This is a clear indication that these datasets are used for their evaluations.

I will then look for any detailed descriptions of these datasets within the paper. In the context of the experiments, the authors refer to **Cifar10** and **ImageNet128** as benchmarks for their methods. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for these datasets are as follows:

- For **Cifar10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet128**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248â€“255. IEEE, 2009.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
