To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Disentangling semantics in language through VAEs and a certain architectural choice" by Ghazi Felhi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions using the **SNLI dataset** for training, which is a good lead.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly state that they used the **SNLI dataset** for their training set, which consists of low complexity text. They mention that they used 90K samples for training and 10K samples for testing. This confirms the dataset's relevance and usage in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SNLI dataset. The citation for the SNLI dataset is as follows:
> Samuel R. Bowman, Lilian Gu, Oriol Vinyals, Andrew M. Dai, Rafal Jozefowicz, and Samy Bengio. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 632â€“640, 2015.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the SNLI dataset and does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information into a structured format.

In summary, I have identified the following dataset from the paper:

1. **SNLI Dataset**: Used for training and testing the model, consisting of low complexity sentences.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry with the full citation for the SNLI dataset, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or processing.
