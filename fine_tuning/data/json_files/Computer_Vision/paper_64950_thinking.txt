To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AlignDiff: Aligning Diverse Human Preferences via Behavior-Customisable Diffusion Model" by Zibin Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the creation of **multi-perspective human feedback datasets** for training an attribute strength model. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find more specific details.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Multi-Perspective Human Feedback Collection)**, where the authors describe how they collected feedback from human annotators. They mention that they created a feedback dataset \( D_p \) consisting of pairs of trajectories with human judgments on various attributes. This section provides insight into the nature of the datasets but does not provide full citations yet.

I will also check **section A (Tasks and Datasets)**, which details the specific locomotion tasks used for experiments. The authors describe three datasets corresponding to different environments:

1. **Hopper Dataset**: Collected from a single-legged robot using pre-trained PPO agents, totaling 5 million time steps.
2. **Walker Dataset**: A bipedal robot dataset with 3.2 million time steps, collected by modifying the reward function and training multiple policies.
3. **Humanoid Dataset**: A dataset for a 3D bipedal robot, also modified for training, with 4 million time steps.

In this section, I will also look for any references to the original sources or papers from which these datasets were derived or any relevant citations.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or referenced correctly in future work.

For the **Hopper Dataset**, the citation is:
> Zhu, Y., et al. *PEDA: A Benchmark for Policy Evaluation in Deep Reinforcement Learning*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2023.

For the **Walker Dataset**, the citation is:
> Tunyasuvunakool, S., et al. *DM Control: Software and Tasks for Continuous Control*. Software Impacts, 2020.

For the **Humanoid Dataset**, the citation is also:
> Tunyasuvunakool, S., et al. *DM Control: Software and Tasks for Continuous Control*. Software Impacts, 2020.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its full citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and can be easily referenced in future research.
