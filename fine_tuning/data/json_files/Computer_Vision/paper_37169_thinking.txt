To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How Deep is Knowledge Tracing?" by Mohammad Khajah et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. In the introduction, the authors reference "two real-world data sets (Assistments, Khan Academy) and one synthetic data set." This indicates that there are at least three datasets that I need to look for.

Next, I will navigate to the **Methods** section, specifically **section 3 (Simulations)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **Assistments**: This dataset is described as an electronic tutor that teaches and evaluates students in grade-school math. The authors note that the 2009-2010 "skill builder" dataset is a large, standard benchmark, and they provide a way to access it by searching for "assistment-2009-2010-data."

2. **Synthetic**: This dataset is a synthetic one created by Piech et al. to model virtual students learning virtual skills. The authors describe its structure, including the number of students and exercises, and how the data is generated.

3. **Spanish**: This dataset consists of 182 middle-school students practicing 409 Spanish exercises over a 15-week semester, with a total of 578,726 trials.

4. **Statics**: This dataset is from a college-level engineering statics course, comprising 189,297 trials and 333 students with 1,223 exercises.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Assistments dataset**, the citation is:
> Koedinger, K., Baker, R., Cunningham, K., Skogsholm, A., Leber, B., & Stamper, J. (2010). A data repository for the EDM community: The PSLC DataShop. In C. Romero, S. Ventura, M. Pechenizkiy, & R. Baker (Eds.), Handbook of Educational Data Mining. Retrieved from http://pslcdatashop.org.

For the **Spanish dataset**, the citation is:
> Lindsey, R., Shroyer, J., Pashler, H., & Mozer, M. (2014). Improving student’s long-term knowledge retention with personalized review. Psychological Science, 25, 639–647.

For the **Statics dataset**, the citation is:
> Steif, P., & Bier, N. (2014). OLI Engineering Statics – Fall 2011. Retrieved from http://oli.cmu.edu.

The **Synthetic dataset** does not have a specific citation since it was created by Piech et al. and is described in their paper:
> Piech, C., Bassen, J., Huang, J., Ganguli, S., Sahami, M., Guibas, L. J., & Sohl-Dickstein, J. (2015). Deep knowledge tracing. In C. Cortes, N. D. Lawrence, D. D. Lee, M. Sugiyama, & R. Garnett (Eds.), Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28 (pp. 505–513). Curran Associates, Inc.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
