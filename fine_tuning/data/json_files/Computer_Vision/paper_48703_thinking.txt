To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dataset for Eye-Tracking Tasks" by Rakhmatulin Ildar, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract indicates that the paper presents a dataset suitable for training convolutional neural networks for eye-tracking tasks, which suggests that there may be additional datasets referenced throughout the paper.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction** and **subsequent sections**. In the introduction, the author discusses the need for a dataset tailored for eye-tracking, which confirms the existence of a primary dataset created by the author. 

I will then examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss the datasets in detail. The author lists several datasets that are relevant to eye-tracking tasks:

1. **Columbia Gaze Dataset**: This dataset consists of 5,880 images of 56 individuals, capturing various gaze directions and head poses. The dataset is available at the Columbia University website.

2. **OpenEDS Facebook Dataset**: This dataset includes 12,759 images collected from 152 participants, annotated for semantic segmentation. It is available upon request from the OpenEDS challenge website.

3. **MPIIGaze Dataset**: This dataset contains 213,659 images taken in everyday conditions using built-in webcams from 15 participants.

4. **Kaggle Datasets**: The author mentions several datasets available on Kaggle, including competitions that provide access to eye-tracking datasets.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide users to the original sources.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets mentioned in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
