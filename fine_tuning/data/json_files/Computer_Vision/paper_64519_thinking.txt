To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving CLIP Robustness with Knowledge Distillation and Self-Training" by Clement Laroudie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to gather initial information about the datasets used. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on various datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 5)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention multiple datasets, including:

1. **CIFAR10**: A well-known dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images.
3. **Tiny ImageNet**: A smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 200 classes with 500 training images per class.
4. **STL-10**: A dataset for unsupervised feature learning, containing 10 classes with 5,000 labeled images and 100,000 unlabeled images.
5. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset for image classification, containing over 14 million images across 20,000 categories.
6. **SVHN**: The Street View House Numbers dataset, used for digit recognition in natural images.
7. **Texture**: A dataset used for evaluating texture recognition.
8. **ImageNet-O**: A dataset for out-of-distribution detection based on ImageNet.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the experiments.

For example, the citations I will look for include:

- For **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, MIT, 2009.

- For **Tiny ImageNet**:
  > Ya Le and Xuan Yang. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. CS 231N, 7(7):3, 2015.

- For **STL-10**:
  > Adam Coates, Andrew Ng, and Honglak Lee. *An Analysis of Single-Layer Networks in Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In AISTATS, 2011.

- For **ImageNet**:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In CVPR, 2009.

- For **SVHN**:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. 2011.

- For **Texture** and **ImageNet-O**, I will need to look for their specific citations in the references.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
