To extract datasets from the research paper titled "From Social to Individuals: a Parsimonious Path of Multi-level Models for Crowdsourced Preference Aggregation" by Qianqian Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments with both simulated and real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation. In this section, they mention using **one simulated dataset** and **three real-world datasets**. I will look for specific names and details of these datasets.

Upon reviewing the experiments, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **MovieLens Dataset**: This dataset is comprised of 3952 movies rated by 6040 users, with ratings on a scale from 1 to 5. The authors mention that they selected a subset of this dataset containing 100 movies rated by 420 users for their experiments.

2. **LIVE Dataset**: This dataset is used for image quality assessment and includes paired comparisons collected from 342 observers. The authors reference this dataset in the context of their experiments on subjective visual property prediction.

3. **WorldCollege Dataset**: This dataset consists of 261 colleges and includes 8,823 pairwise comparisons collected via crowdsourcing, where annotators were asked to decide which college is more attractive to attend.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MovieLens Dataset**, the citation is:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 5(4):1-19, 2015.

- For the **LIVE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > H. Sheikh, Z. Wang, L. Cormack, and A. Bovik. *LIVE Image Quality Assessment Database*. 2008. Available: http://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/quality.

- For the **WorldCollege Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Q. Xu, Q. Huang, T. Jiang, B. Yan, W. Lin, and Y. Yao. *HodgeRank on Random Graphs for Subjective Video Quality Assessment*. IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, 14(3):844â€“857, 2012.

With these details in hand, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I include all necessary information for each dataset as required.
