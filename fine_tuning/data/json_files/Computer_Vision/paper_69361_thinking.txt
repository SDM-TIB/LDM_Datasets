To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Text2Street: Controllable Text-to-image Generation for Street Views" by Jinming Su et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset called **nuScenes**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of street-view text-to-image generation, hinting at the need for a robust dataset for validation.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they describe the **nuScenes dataset** in detail, noting that it contains 1,000 street-view scenes divided into training, validation, and testing sets, with each scene comprising approximately 40 frames and labeled semantic maps.

Now, I will gather the necessary details about the nuScenes dataset, including its structure and the number of scenes and frames. The paper states that the dataset is used in a specific way, focusing on images captured by the FRONT camera, which is important for understanding how the dataset was utilized in the experiments.

Finally, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the nuScenes dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

> Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yu Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *nuScenes: A multi-modal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 11621â€“11631, 2020.

With this information, I will summarize the dataset details and ensure that I have the full citation ready for inclusion in the final output.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset's name, description, and citation, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured for future reference.
