To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Disentangled Variational Autoencoder for Emotion Recognition in Conversations" by Kailai Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their model on two datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper. I will look for specific names and descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will navigate to **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **IEMOCAP**: This dataset is described as a two-party multi-modal conversation dataset derived from scripted scenarios involving two actors. The authors specify that they only utilize the text modality for their experiments. The pre-defined categorical emotions in this dataset include neutral, sad, anger, happy, frustrated, and excited.

2. **MELD**: This dataset is a multi-party multi-modal dataset enriched from the EmotionLines dataset, collected from the scripts of the American TV show "Friends." The emotions defined in this dataset are neutral, sad, anger, disgust, fear, happy, and surprise.

3. **DailyDialog**: This dataset is compiled from human-written daily conversations involving two parties, without speaker information. The pre-defined emotion labels include neutral, happy, surprise, sad, anger, disgust, and fear.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to obtain the full citations for each dataset:

- For **IEMOCAP**, the citation is:
  > Busso, C., Bulut, M., Lee, C.-C., Kazemzadeh, A., Mower, E., Kim, S., Chang, J. N., Lee, S., & Narayanan, S. S. (2008). *IEMOCAP: Interactive emotional dyadic motion capture database*. Language Resources and Evaluation, 42(4), 335-359.

- For **MELD**, the citation is:
  > Poria, S., Hazarika, D., Majumder, N., Naik, G., Cambria, E., & Mihalcea, R. (2019). *MELD: A multimodal multi-party dataset for emotion recognition in conversations*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 527-536.

- For **DailyDialog**, the citation is:
  > Li, Y., Su, H., Shen, X., Li, W., Cao, Z., & Niu, S. (2017). *DailyDialog: A manually labelled multi-turn dialogue dataset*. In Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP), 986-995.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
