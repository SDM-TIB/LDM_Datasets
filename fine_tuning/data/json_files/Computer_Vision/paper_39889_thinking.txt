To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative Imaging and Image Processing via Generative Encoder" by Lin Chen and Haizhao Yang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the generative encoder model and its applications, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of deep learning in imaging and image processing but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **implementation section** where the authors describe the training data used for their experiments.

In **section 4.1 (Training Details)**, the authors mention using the **CelebA dataset** for their experiments. They specify that this dataset contains more than 200,000 celebrity images cropped to sizes of 64 × 64 × 3 and 128 × 128 × 3. This is a clear identification of a dataset used in their research.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CelebA dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- For **CelebA dataset**:
  > Z. Liu, P. Luo, X. Wang, and X. Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will summarize my findings.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the CelebA dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will be ready for any structured output or further processing needed.
