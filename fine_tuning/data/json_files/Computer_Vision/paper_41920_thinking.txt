To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recurrent Feedback Improves Feedforward Representations in Deep Neural Networks" by Siming Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not specify datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and may mention datasets used in previous work or the current study.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly section 3.4 (Training and Testing), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for training and testing their models. Here, they list four benchmark datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 10 classes of low-resolution images (32 x 32 pixels).
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes of low-resolution images (64 x 64 pixels).
3. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with 1000 classes of high-resolution images (224 x 224 pixels).
4. **CUB-200**: A dataset used for fine-grained recognition, which contains images of 200 bird species.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their model on these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

- For **CUB-200**, the citation is:
  > Nathan B. Cohen, et al. *CUB-200-2011: A Dataset for Fine-Grained Bird Classification*. 2011.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
