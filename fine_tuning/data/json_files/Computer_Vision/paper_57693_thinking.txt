To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Evolution of (Hateful) Memes by Means of Multimodal Contrastive Learning" by Yiting Qu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors use a dataset extracted from 4chan, which indicates that there is a specific dataset involved. The introduction further elaborates on the context of memes and their evolution, hinting at the datasets used for analysis.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their dataset in detail in the **Background** section, where they mention using a dataset collected by Zannettou et al. This dataset includes all images shared on 4chan's /pol/ board from June 30, 2016, to July 31, 2017, totaling 4.3 million images. They also mention filtering these images to create a set of 12.5 million image-text pairs.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The key dataset identified is:

1. **4chan Dataset**: 
   - Citation:
     > Savvas Zannettou, Tristan Caulfield, Jeremy Blackburn, Emiliano De Cristofaro, Michael Sirivianos, Gianluca Stringhini, and Guillermo Suarez-Tangil. *On the Origins of Memes by Means of Fringe Web Communities*. In ACM Internet Measurement Conference (IMC), pages 188â€“202, 2018.

Additionally, the authors mention that they will make all discovered Happy Merchant variants available upon request, which indicates that they are creating a specific dataset related to their findings.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
