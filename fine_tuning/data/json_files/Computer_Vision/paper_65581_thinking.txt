To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation with Image-Level Labels: from Traditional Models to Foundation Models" by Zhaozheng Chen and Qianru Sun, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses weakly-supervised semantic segmentation and mentions the use of image-level labels, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, they mention two benchmark datasets: **PASCAL VOC 2012** and **MS COCO 2014**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and the number of images.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide specific information about the datasets:
1. **PASCAL VOC 2012**: This dataset contains 20 foreground object categories and 1 background category, with a total of 1,464 training images, 1,449 validation images, and 1,456 test images. The authors also mention that they use an enlarged training set with 10,582 training images provided by SBD.

2. **MS COCO 2014**: This dataset consists of 80 foreground categories and 1 background category, with 82,783 training images and 40,504 validation images.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution. The citations I will extract are:

- For **PASCAL VOC 2012**:
  > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2):303–338, 2010.

- For **MS COCO 2014**:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
