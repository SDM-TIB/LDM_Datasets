To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Highly Realistic Artistic Style Transfer via Stable Diffusion with Step-aware and Layer-aware Prompt" by Zhanjie Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of a novel diffusion-based artistic style transfer method, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss existing methods and their limitations. They reference various GAN-based and diffusion-based approaches, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned here.

I will then examine the **experiments section** (if available) to see if the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section is crucial as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets employed in the study. If the paper has a dedicated section for datasets, I will look for it to find explicit mentions of any datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If the paper does not provide specific datasets, I will look for any supplementary materials or links provided by the authors, such as GitHub repositories or dataset URLs, which may contain additional information about the datasets used in their experiments.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all citations are complete and formatted correctly for future reference.
