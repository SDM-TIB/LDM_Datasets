To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transformer-CNN Fused Architecture for Enhanced Skin Lesion Segmentation" by Siddharth Tiwari, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the importance of medical image segmentation, which suggests that datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Implementation)**, specifically the **3.1 Data Selection** subsection, where the author explicitly mentions the dataset used for the research. Here, the paper states that the **ISIC dataset** is utilized, which is a well-known collection of dermoscopic images of skin lesions.

In this section, the author provides details about the dataset, including:
- The dataset contains **2,000 images for training**, **150 images for validation**, and **600 images for testing**.
- The images are accompanied by **ground truth masks** for segmentation tasks.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the ISIC dataset. The relevant citation provided in the paper is:

> Noel CF Codella, David Gutman, M Emre Celebi, Brian Helba, Michael A Marchetti, Stephen W Dusza, Aadi Kalloo, Konstantinos Liopyris, Nabin Mishra, Harald Kittler, et al. *Skin lesion analysis toward melanoma detection: A challenge at the 2017 international symposium on biomedical imaging (ISBI), hosted by the international skin imaging collaboration (ISIC)*. In 2018 IEEE 15th international symposium on biomedical imaging (ISBI 2018), pages 168â€“172. IEEE, 2018.

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the dataset details and the citation in a structured manner, ensuring that I include all necessary components for clarity and completeness.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that the citation is accurately represented.
