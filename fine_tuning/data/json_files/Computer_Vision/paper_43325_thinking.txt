To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-View Self-Attention for Interpretable Drug-Target Interaction Prediction" by Brighter Agyemang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their approach using **three benchmark kinase datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets are involved.

Next, I will look closely at **section 5.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. They mention:

1. **Davis Dataset**: This dataset is used for predicting drug-target interactions and is measured in inhibition constant (Ki). The paper states that it contains a total of 31824 pair samples.

2. **Metz Dataset**: Another dataset used for the same purpose, with a total of 35259 pair samples, measured in dissociation constant (Kd).

3. **KIBA Dataset**: This dataset is also utilized for drug-target interaction prediction, with a total of 160296 pair samples, measured using the KIBA metric.

The authors also mention that these datasets have been curated and filtered according to specific thresholds, which is important for understanding their applicability.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Davis Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. I. Davis, J. P. Hunt, S. Herrgard, P. Ciceri, L. M. Wodicka, G. Pallares, M. Hocker, D. K. Treiber, P. P. Zarrinkar. *Comprehensive analysis of kinase inhibitor selectivity*. Nature Biotechnology, 29(2):104â€“110, 2011. doi:10.1038/nbt.1990.

- For the **Metz Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. T. Metz, E. F. Johnson, N. B. Soni, P. J. Merta, L. Kifle, P. J. Hajduk. *Navigating the kinome*. Nature Chemical Biology, 10(3): 206-213, 2014. doi:10.1038/nchembio.530.

- For the **KIBA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Tang, A. Szwajda, S. Shakyawar, T. Xu, P. Hintsanen, K. Wennerberg, T. Aittokallio. *Making sense of large-scale kinase inhibitor bioactivity data sets: A comparative and integrative analysis*. Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, 54(3): 735-743, 2014. doi:10.1021/ci400709d.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
