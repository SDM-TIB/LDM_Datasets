To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SAME++: A medical image registration framework enhanced via self-supervised anatomical embeddings" by Lin Tian et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the method is evaluated using more than 50 labeled organs across three inter-subject registration tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section V), where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention three specific datasets:

1. **Head & Neck CT**: This dataset consists of CT images from 72 head and neck cancer patients, with 13 manually labeled organs. The authors provide details about how the dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets.

2. **Chest CT**: This dataset includes CT images from 94 subjects, with 35 anatomical structures manually labeled. The authors also describe the dataset's split and preprocessing steps.

3. **Abdomen CT**: This dataset contains 30 CT images, with 13 labeled anatomical structures. The authors detail the dataset's split for training and testing.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Springer, 2021, pp. 3–12.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
