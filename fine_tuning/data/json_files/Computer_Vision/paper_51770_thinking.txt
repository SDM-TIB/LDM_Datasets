To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards a Cleaner Document-Oriented Multilingual Crawled Corpus" by Julien Abadji et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets. The abstract mentions the use of the **OSCAR corpus**, which is a significant clue that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the need for large corpora in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and reference the OSCAR project. This indicates that OSCAR is a central dataset in their work.

In the **corpus section**, the authors provide detailed information about the OSCAR corpus, including its size and the languages it covers. They mention that OSCAR 22.01 is a new document-oriented corpus derived from Common Crawl, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors provide comparisons with other datasets. They reference previous versions of OSCAR (like OSCAR 21.09) and discuss their improvements, which reinforces the importance of OSCAR as a dataset.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The key dataset identified is:

- **OSCAR Corpus**: The authors refer to multiple versions of this corpus, including OSCAR 21.09 and OSCAR 22.01. The citation for the OSCAR corpus is:
  > Ortiz Suárez, P. J., Sagot, B., & Romary, L. (2019). Asynchronous pipelines for processing huge corpora on medium to low resource infrastructures. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Challenges in the Management of Large Corpora (CMLC-7) 2019. Cardiff, 22nd July 2019, pages 9 – 16, Mannheim. Leibniz-Institut für Deutsche Sprache.

Additionally, the authors mention the **Common Crawl** dataset as the source for OSCAR, which is also significant. The citation for Common Crawl is:
  > Common Crawl. (n.d.). Common Crawl. Retrieved from https://commoncrawl.org

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that full citations are included for reference. This structured approach will help ensure that all relevant datasets are accurately captured and documented.
