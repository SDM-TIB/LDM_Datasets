To extract datasets from the research paper titled "I4VGEN: Image as Stepping Stone for Text-to-Video Generation" by Xiefan Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges in text-to-video generation and hints at the use of existing models, but it does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors mention that they applied their method to two well-known video diffusion models: **AnimateDiff** and **LaVie**. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets used for training or evaluation in the experiments.

I will also look for any **figures or tables** that might reference datasets indirectly. For instance, if there are any performance metrics or comparisons, they might imply the datasets used, but in this case, the paper focuses more on the methods and results rather than specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references of the models used. However, the paper primarily discusses the methodologies and does not provide specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this particular paper. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none are identified.

In summary, my process involved:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Examining the experiments section for explicit dataset details.
3. Looking for indirect references in figures, tables, or the references section.
4. Concluding that no datasets are mentioned in the paper.

As a result, there are no dataset entries to compile or cite from this research paper.
