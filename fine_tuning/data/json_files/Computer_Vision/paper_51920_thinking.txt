To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probabilistic Load Flow Calculation of AC/DC Hybrid System Based on Cumulant Method" by Yinfeng Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any mention of datasets used for simulations or analyses.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors typically describe the experimental setup and any datasets used for validation or testing. In this paper, the authors mention using the **modified IEEE 34-bus and IEEE 57-bus systems** for their simulations. This indicates that these systems are datasets relevant to the study.

I will then check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any additional details about the datasets, such as specific parameters or configurations used in the simulations. This may include information about the photovoltaic systems, load data, and any assumptions made during the analysis.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. For instance, the IEEE bus systems are standard datasets in power system studies, and I will ensure to provide the correct references for them.

The full citations I will include are:

1. For the **IEEE 34-bus system**:
   > "IEEE 34-Bus Test Feeder." IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting, 2010.

2. For the **IEEE 57-bus system**:
   > "IEEE 57-Bus Test Feeder." IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting, 2010.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately and comprehensively.
