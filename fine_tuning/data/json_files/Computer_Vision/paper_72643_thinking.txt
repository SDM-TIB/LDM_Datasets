To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Text-Driven Motion Generation via Latent Consistency Training" by Mengxian Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their framework on two benchmarks, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they state that they evaluate their framework on two widely used datasets: **KIT** and **HumanML3D**. I will take note of the details provided about each dataset.

1. **KIT Dataset**: The authors describe it as containing 3,911 motions and their corresponding 6,363 natural language descriptions. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

2. **HumanML3D Dataset**: This dataset is described as a large 3D human motion dataset that comprises the HumanAct12 and AMASS datasets, containing 14,616 motions and 44,970 descriptions. This dataset is also essential for their evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **KIT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Matthias Plappert, Christian Mandery, and Tamim Asfour. *The KIT Motion-Language Dataset*. Big Data, 4(4):236–252, 2016.

- For the **HumanML3D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chuan Guo, Xinxin Zuo, Sen Wang, Shihao Zou, Qingyao Sun, Annan Deng, Minglun Gong, and Li Cheng. *Generating Diverse and Natural 3D Human Motions from Text*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 5152–5161, 2022.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
