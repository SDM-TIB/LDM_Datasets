To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continuous Diffusion for Categorical Data" by Sander Dieleman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference datasets that are relevant to their research. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

I will then examine the **experiments section**, which typically details the datasets used for training and evaluation. This section is crucial as it often contains specific names, descriptions, and characteristics of the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **C4 dataset** for training, I would look for the citation in the references section, which might be formatted as follows:
> Raffel, C., Shazeer, N., Roberts, A., Lee, K., Narang, S., Matena, M., Zhou, Y., & Liu, P. J. (2019). Exploring the limits of transfer learning with a unified text-to-text transformer. arXiv preprint arXiv:1910.10683.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while providing proper citations for each one.
