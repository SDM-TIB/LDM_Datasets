To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FedHome: Cloud-Edge based Personalized Federated Learning for In-Home Health Monitoring" by Qiong Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments based on realistic human activity recognition data traces, suggesting that a specific dataset is used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset Description and Preprocessing)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention the **MobiAct dataset**, which is a publicly accessible human activity recognition dataset. The authors provide details about the dataset, including the number of volunteers, the type of data collected (accelerometer and gyroscope signals), and the activities recorded.

In this section, the authors describe the dataset as follows:
- **MobiAct Dataset**: This dataset includes data from 57 volunteers who performed various activities while wearing smartphones equipped with sensors. The activities are categorized into three types: activities of daily living (ADLs), fall-like activities, and actual falls.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MobiAct dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> George Vavoulas, Charikleia Chatzaki, Thodoris Malliotakis, Matthew Pediaditis, and Manolis Tsiknakis. *The MobiAct Dataset: Recognition of Activities of Daily Living Using Smartphones*. In ICT4AgeingWell, pages 143â€“151, 2016.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:
1. **MobiAct Dataset**: A dataset for human activity recognition, collected from 57 volunteers using smartphones with accelerometers and gyroscopes, containing various activities relevant to in-home health monitoring.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation is included for the MobiAct dataset.
