To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Advection Augmented Convolutional Neural Networks" by Niloufar Zakariaei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their network's effectiveness on several spatio-temporal datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they categorize the datasets into two groups: **Scientific Datasets** and **Video Prediction Datasets**. 

1. **Scientific Datasets**:
   - **SWE (Shallow Water Equations)**: The authors describe this dataset as comprising 900 sets of 101 images, each representing a time step derived from the compressible Navier-Stokes equations.
   - **CloudCast**: This dataset consists of 70,080 satellite images captured every 15 minutes, with a resolution of 3712 × 3712 pixels, covering the entire disk of Earth.

2. **Video Prediction Datasets**:
   - **Moving MNIST**: A synthetic video dataset featuring 20-frame sequences where two MNIST digits move with random trajectories.
   - **KITTI**: A widely recognized dataset used extensively in mobile robotics and autonomous driving, serving as a benchmark for computer vision algorithms.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **SWE (Shallow Water Equations)**, the citation is:
  > Makoto Takamoto, Timothy Praditia, Raphael Leiteritz, Dan MacKinlay, Francesco Alesiani, Dirk Pflüger, and Mathias Niepert. *PDEBench: An Extensive Benchmark for Scientific Machine Learning*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35:1596–1611, 2022.

- For **CloudCast**, the citation is:
  > Junbo Zhang, Yu Zheng, and Dekang Qi. *Deep Spatio-Temporal Residual Networks for Citywide Crowd Flows Prediction*. Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, volume 31, 2017.

- For **Moving MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yunbo Wang, Jianjin Zhang, Hongyu Zhu, Mingsheng Long, Jianmin Wang, and Philip S Yu. *Memory in Memory: A Predictive Neural Network for Learning Higher-Order Non-Stationarity from Spatiotemporal Dynamics*.

- For **KITTI**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are We Ready for Autonomous Driving? The KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3354–3361, 2012.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
