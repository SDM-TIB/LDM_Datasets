To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Brussels Effect and Artificial Intelligence" by Charlotte Siegmann and Markus Anderljung, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and relevant sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on sections that discuss empirical findings or case studies, as these are likely to contain specific datasets.

Next, I will look for sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as **case studies or empirical analysis**. I will pay particular attention to any tables, figures, or references that might list datasets or provide details about data collection methods.

In the **appendix**, I will check for any case studies or examples that might reference datasets used in the analysis. The authors may have included specific datasets related to AI regulation, compliance, or market analysis.

Once I identify any datasets, I will ensure to note their names, descriptions, and any relevant details provided in the text. I will also look for citations in the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper references datasets related to AI market size or regulatory impacts, I will extract the names and descriptions of these datasets and find their corresponding citations.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.
