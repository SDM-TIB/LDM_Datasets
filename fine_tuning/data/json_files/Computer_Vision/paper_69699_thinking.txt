To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Synthetic location trajectory generation using categorical diffusion models" by Simon Dirmeier et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors compare their model's generated sequences to real-world individual location trajectories (ILTs) derived from a GNSS tracking dataset. This suggests that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Synthetic location trajectory generation)**, where the authors describe the data used for their experiments. They mention using longitudinal GNSS tracking data derived from the "GC study" aimed at evaluating the impact of a mobility offer on individuals' mobility behavior. This section provides crucial details about the dataset.

In **section 3.1 (Data)**, the authors elaborate on the dataset, stating that it consists of pre-processed GNSS tracking measurements from the GC study, which was conducted by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB). They mention that the dataset includes approximately 200 million GNSS measurements, enabling continuous tracking of 139 individuals. This section confirms the dataset's significance and its application in the study.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the dataset in the **References section**. The authors reference the GC study as follows:

- For the GC study, the citation is:
  > Henry Martin, Henrik Becker, Dominik Bucher, David Jonietz, Martin Raubal, and Kay W. Axhausen. *Begleitstudie SBB Green Class - Abschlussbericht*. 2019.

Since the authors do not provide a separate citation for the GNSS tracking data itself, I will use the citation for the GC study as the authoritative reference for the dataset they utilized.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the dataset name, description, and citation, into a structured format for clarity and completeness. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately for future reference or analysis.
