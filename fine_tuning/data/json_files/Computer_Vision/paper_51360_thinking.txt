To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RISK AND OPTIMAL POLICIES IN BANDIT EXPERIMENTS" by Karun Adusumilli, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a concise overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include mentions of datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Data"**, **"Experiments"**, or **"Methodology"**. In these sections, the author may describe the datasets used for analysis, including their sources, characteristics, and any relevant statistics.

As I read through these sections, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, features, or specific conditions under which they were collected.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

If the paper mentions any datasets without providing full citations, I will note these instances and indicate that further investigation may be needed to find the original sources.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and accurate extraction of datasets from the research paper.
