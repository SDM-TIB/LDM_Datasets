To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simplified Graph Convolution with Heterophily" by Sudhanshu Chanpuriya and Cameron Musco, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "synthetic and real-world datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in Section 7, where they mention using "10 commonly-used datasets" for node classification tasks. This is a strong indication that specific datasets will be listed.

I will then carefully read through **Table 1** in Section 7, which provides a summary of the datasets used in their experiments. The table includes the following datasets:

1. **CORA**: A citation network dataset with 2,277 nodes, 5 classes, and a homophily score of 0.247.
2. **CITESEER**: Another citation network with 3,412 nodes, 6 classes, and a homophily score of 0.802.
3. **PUBMED**: A dataset with 19,717 nodes, 3 classes, and a homophily score of 0.849.
4. **COMPUTERS**: A segment of the Amazon co-purchase graph with 7,650 nodes, 5 classes, and a homophily score of 0.301.
5. **PHOTO**: Another segment of the Amazon co-purchase graph with 2,708 nodes, 7 classes, and a homophily score of 0.825.
6. **CHAMELEON**: A hyperlink network from Wikipedia with 1,000 nodes, 5 classes, and a homophily score of 0.217.
7. **SQUIRREL**: Another hyperlink network with 183 nodes, 5 classes, and a homophily score of 0.057.
8. **ACTOR**: An actor-only induced subgraph with 1,703 nodes, 5 classes, and a homophily score of 0.215.
9. **TEXAS**: A hyperlink network from university websites with 183 nodes, 5 classes, and a homophily score of 0.301.
10. **CORNELL**: Another university hyperlink network with 183 nodes, 5 classes, and a homophily score of 0.057.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to these datasets. The paper cites the following relevant works:

- For **CORA**, the citation is:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing.
