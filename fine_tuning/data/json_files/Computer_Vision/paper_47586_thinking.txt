To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Antigenic waves of virus-immune co-evolution" by Jacopo Marchi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets that were used to support their claims or findings. This section often contains background information and may mention previous studies or datasets relevant to the current research.

I will then examine the **methods section**, as it typically details the experimental design and data collection processes. Here, the authors may describe the datasets they used for simulations or analyses, including any specific parameters or configurations.

In the **results section**, I will look for any figures, tables, or descriptions that indicate the datasets utilized in the analysis. The authors may present results derived from specific datasets, which will help confirm their relevance.

Finally, I will check the **discussion section** for any reflections on the datasets used, including their significance, limitations, or implications for the study's conclusions.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset from a previous study, I will ensure to extract the complete citation for that study, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets referenced in the paper and provide proper credit to the original sources.
