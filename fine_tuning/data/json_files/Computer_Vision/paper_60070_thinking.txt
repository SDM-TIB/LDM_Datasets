To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mask Detection and Classification in Thermal Face Images" by Natalia Kowalczyk and Jacek Rumiński, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors extended a previously proposed dataset of thermal images, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their research. This section is likely to contain the most comprehensive information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In **subsection 2.1 (Face with Mask Thermal Dataset)**, the authors describe their own dataset, the Face with Mask Thermal Dataset (FMT Dataset), which contains 9,394 images of people wearing different types of masks. They mention the types of masks included (FFP2, surgical, and cloth) and provide details about the data collection process, including the use of a FLIR Boson camera and the ethical considerations involved.

In **subsection 2.2 (Simulated Dataset)**, the authors discuss a simulated dataset created using the WIKI dataset, which was prepared for mask detection by applying various types of masks to images. This dataset is also relevant for understanding the context of their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations will be crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. For the **Face with Mask Thermal Dataset (FMT Dataset)**, since it is a dataset created by the authors, I will note that it is unpublished but can be referenced as:
   > Kowalczyk, N., & Rumiński, J. (2023). *Face with Mask Thermal Dataset*. Unpublished dataset.

2. For the **WIKI dataset**, I will find the citation in the references:
   > Rothe, R., Timofte, R., & Van Gool, L. (2015). *DEX: Deep expectation of apparent age from a single image*. In IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCVW).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
