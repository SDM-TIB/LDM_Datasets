To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Seam-guided local alignment and stitching for large parallax images" by Tianli Liao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments and compared their method with other seam-cutting methods, which suggests that datasets were used for these experiments. I will look for any specific dataset names mentioned.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. In this section, the authors mention testing their method on public image datasets, specifically noting that they used "20 image pairs from our dataset, 35 image pairs from [26], and 24 image pairs from [18]." This indicates that there are at least three datasets involved.

I will then identify the datasets referenced by their citations. The paper cites other works, so I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Our dataset**: The authors do not provide a specific citation for their own dataset in the text, but they mention it in the context of their experiments. I will note that this dataset is likely created by the authors for the purpose of this research.

2. **Dataset from [26]**: The reference for this dataset is:
   > Zhang F, Liu F. *Parallax-tolerant image stitching*. In: Proc. IEEE Conf. Computer Vision Pattern Recognit., pp 3262–3269, 2014.

3. **Dataset from [18]**: The reference for this dataset is:
   > Lin K, Jiang N, Cheong LF, et al. *Seagull: Seam-guided local alignment for parallax-tolerant image stitching*. In: Proc. 14th Eur. Conf. Computer Vision, pp 370–385, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset:

- **Our dataset**: This dataset consists of 20 image pairs created by the authors for quantitative comparison in their experiments. No formal citation is provided.

- **Dataset from [26]**: This dataset consists of 35 image pairs used for comparison with the authors' method. The full citation is provided above.

- **Dataset from [18]**: This dataset consists of 24 image pairs used for comparison. The full citation is provided above.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or analysis.
