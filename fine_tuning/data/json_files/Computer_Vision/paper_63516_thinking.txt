To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AutoSeqRec: Autoencoder for Efficient Sequential Recommendation" by Sijia Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted comprehensive evaluations on four datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used in their experiments in **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**. Here, they mention four datasets: **ML-100K**, **ML-1M**, **Garden**, and **Video**.

I will extract the relevant details for each dataset:

1. **ML-100K**: This dataset contains 100,000 interactions collected from users over a seven-month period. It has 943 users and 1,349 items.

2. **ML-1M**: This dataset consists of 1,000,000 interactions from users who joined MovieLens in 2000. It has 6,040 users and 3,416 items.

3. **Garden**: This dataset is from Amazon and contains ratings for 1,686 items with 5,130 users and 13,272 interactions.

4. **Video**: Another Amazon dataset, it has 5,130 users, 1,685 items, and 37,126 interactions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the MovieLens datasets are typically well-known, but I will ensure to include them for completeness:

- For **ML-100K**:
  > F Maxwell Harper and Joseph A Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS), 5(4), 2015.

- For **ML-1M**:
  > F Maxwell Harper and Joseph A Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS), 5(4), 2015.

- For **Garden** and **Video**, the citations may refer to the original Amazon dataset papers or can be cited as:
  > Ruining He and Julian McAuley. *Ups and Downs: Modeling the Visual Evolution of Fashion Trends with One-Class Collaborative Filtering*. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web, 2016.

Now, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
