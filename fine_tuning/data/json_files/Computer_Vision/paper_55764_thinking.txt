To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Personalizing Text-to-Image Generation via Aesthetic Gradients" by Victor Gallego, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of "aesthetically-filtered datasets," which indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the personalization of text-to-image models and reference previous works. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets here, so I will continue to the next sections.

Next, I will examine the **method section** where the authors describe their approach. While this section focuses on the methodology, it does not provide specific dataset names either. 

Moving on to the **experiments section**, the authors mention two specific aesthetic embeddings used for their experiments: **SAC8+** and **LAION7+**. They describe SAC8+ as a subset of Simulacra Aesthetic Captions with images filtered to have a rating greater than 8, and LAION7+ as a subset of LAION Aesthetics v1 with images filtered to have a rating greater than 7. This is crucial information as it identifies the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **SAC8+**, the citation is:
   > John David Pressman, Katherine Crowson, and Simulacra Captions Contributors. *Simulacra Aesthetic Captions*. Technical Report Version 1.0, Stability AI, 2022. Available at: https://github.com/JD-P/simulacra-aesthetic-captions.

2. For **LAION7+**, the citation is:
   > LAION. *LAION Aesthetics v1*. Technical Report Version 1.0, LAION AI, 2022. Available at: https://github.com/LAION-AI/aesthetic-predictor.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
