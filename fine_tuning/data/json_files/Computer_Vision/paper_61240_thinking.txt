To extract datasets from the research paper titled "InstructAlign: High-and-Low Resource Language Alignment via Continual Crosslingual Instruction Tuning" by Samuel Cahyawijaya et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the proposed method on Indonesian local languages datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Experiment Setting)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention four specific datasets:

1. **NusaX**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis and covers 12 languages, including English and Indonesian, along with several local Indonesian languages. The authors provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of languages and samples.

2. **NusaTranslation**: This dataset is also used for sentiment analysis and includes 11 languages, with specific details about the languages involved and the number of samples.

3. **NusaParagraph**: This dataset is utilized for both emotion recognition and topic classification tasks, covering 10 languages. The authors provide detailed statistics about the dataset.

4. **IndoLEM**: This dataset is mentioned as a source for Indonesian sentiment analysis data, which is used in conjunction with NusaTranslation.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **NusaX**, the citation is:
  > Winata, G. I., Cahyawijaya, S., et al. (2022). *NusaX: Multilingual parallel sentiment dataset for Indonesian local languages*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2205.15960.

- For **NusaTranslation**, the citation is:
  > Cahyawijaya, S., Winata, G. I., et al. (2023). *NusaTranslation: A multilingual dataset for sentiment analysis*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.13592.

- For **NusaParagraph**, the citation is:
  > Cahyawijaya, S., Winata, G. I., et al. (2023). *NusaParagraph: A dataset for emotion recognition and topic classification*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.13592.

- For **IndoLEM**, the citation is:
  > Koto, F., Rahimi, A., Lau, J. H., & Baldwin, T. (2020). *IndoLEM and IndoBERT: A benchmark dataset and pre-trained language model for Indonesian NLP*. In Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, pages 757â€“770.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its purpose, languages involved, and the full citation for each dataset. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details for future reference or processing.
