To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi Few-Shot Attribute Translation" by Ricard Durall et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the **CelebA dataset** for training, which is a strong indication that this dataset is significant to the research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they trained their model on the **CelebA dataset**, which consists of 202,599 celebrity face images with various facial attributes. They also mention that they selected a balanced subset of 32,502 images focusing on hair attributes.

I will also check the **related work** and **methodology sections** to see if any other datasets are mentioned or referenced. However, the primary focus of this paper appears to be on the CelebA dataset, as it is the only dataset explicitly discussed in the context of their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the CelebA dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Z. Liu, P. Luo, X. Wang, and X. Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 3730â€“3738, 2015.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **CelebA Dataset**: This dataset is used for training the model and consists of 202,599 images of celebrity faces with various attributes, focusing on hair color attributes for the experiments.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
