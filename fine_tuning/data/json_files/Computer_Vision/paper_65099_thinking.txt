To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion Models as Masked Audio-Video Learners" by Elvis Nunez et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "large availability of unlabeled videos," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they mention using the union of the "balanced" and "unbalanced" splits of the **AudioSet** dataset, referred to as "AS-2M." This indicates that AudioSet is a key dataset for their experiments.

Additionally, they mention fine-tuning on the "balanced" AudioSet split, denoted as **AS-20K**, and also on **VGGSound**, **Environmental Sound Classification (ESC-50)**, and **Speech Commands v2 (SPC-v2)**. Each of these datasets is likely to have specific characteristics that are relevant to their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

4. **Speech Commands v2**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be clearly documented with its citation to ensure proper attribution.
