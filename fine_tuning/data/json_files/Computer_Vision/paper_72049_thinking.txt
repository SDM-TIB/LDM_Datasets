To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IntrinsicAnything: Learning Diffusion Priors for Inverse Rendering Under Unknown Illumination" by Xi Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a model that utilizes existing 3D object data, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of inverse rendering and mention the use of data-driven priors. They also refer to the need for training data, which may lead me to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe their training process. They mention creating a dataset consisting of RGB, albedo, and specular images based on the **Objaverse dataset**. This is a clear indication of a dataset that is crucial for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the evaluation of their method on synthetic and real-world data. They mention collecting 4 CAD models with a variety of object shapes and materials, which were rendered with 120 images each. This indicates that they have created a custom dataset for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Objaverse Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Deitke, M., Schwenk, D., Salvador, J., Weihs, L., Michel, O., VanderBilt, E., Schmidt, L., Ehsani, K., Kembhavi, A., Farhadi, A. (2023). *Objaverse: A universe of annotated 3D objects*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. pp. 13142â€“13153.

2. **CAD Models Dataset**: Since the authors created their own dataset based on 4 CAD models, I will note that this dataset does not have a formal citation as it is a custom dataset created for the study.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.
