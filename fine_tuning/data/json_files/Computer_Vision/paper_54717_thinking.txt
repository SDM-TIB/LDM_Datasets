To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cancer Subtyping by Improved Transcriptomic Features Using Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder" by Zheng Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on multiple datasets comprising 10 distinct cancers, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Methods)**, specifically the subsection titled **A. Datasets and Preprocessing**. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention that they utilized the TCGA datasets for 10 distinct cancers, which include:

1. **Breast cancer (BRCA)**
2. **Brain cancer (GBM, LGG)**
3. **Ovary cancer (OV)**
4. **Bronchus and lung cancer (LUAD)**
5. **Kidney cancer (KIRC)**
6. **Tongue cancer (HNSC)**
7. **Colon cancer (COAD)**
8. **Bladder cancer (BLCA)**
9. **Prostate cancer (PRAD)**

The authors also note that the results for breast cancer are presented in the main text, while results for the other cancers are deferred to the appendix. This indicates that the datasets are derived from the TCGA, which is a well-known resource for cancer genomics data.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the TCGA dataset. The citation for the TCGA is as follows:

- **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)**: 
  > Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, J. N. Weinstein, E. A. Collisson, G. B. Mills, K. R. Shaw, B. A. Ozenberger, K. Ellrott, I. Shmulevich, C. Sander, and J. M. Stuart. *The cancer genome atlas pan-cancer analysis project*. Nature Genetics, vol. 45, no. 10, pp. 1113â€“1120, Oct. 2013.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the dataset names and their corresponding citations, ready for further processing or review.
