To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shapes" by Zhirong Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a dataset called **ModelNet** for training their 3D deep learning model, which is a significant clue that I need to explore further.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (ModelNet: A Large-scale 3D CAD Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They describe how ModelNet was constructed by downloading 3D CAD models from various sources, including 3D Warehouse and Yobi3D, and how they ensured the dataset contained a diverse range of object categories.

In this section, the authors mention that ModelNet contains **151,128 3D CAD models belonging to 660 unique object categories**. This is crucial information that I need to document.

Additionally, I will check the **experiments section** to see if any other datasets are referenced. The authors mention using the **NYU RGB-D dataset** for evaluating their model's performance on real-world data. This dataset is also important to include.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for both datasets:

1. For **ModelNet**, the citation is:
   > Zhirong Wu, Shuran Song, Aditya Khosla, Fisher Yu, Linguang Zhang, Xiaoou Tang. *3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1912-1920, 2015.

2. For the **NYU RGB-D dataset**, the citation is:
   > Nathan Silberman, Derek Hoiem, and Rob Fergus. *Indoor Segmentation and Support Inference from RGBD Images*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 746-760, 2012.

With this information gathered, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will allow for clear documentation and reference in any subsequent analysis or processing.
