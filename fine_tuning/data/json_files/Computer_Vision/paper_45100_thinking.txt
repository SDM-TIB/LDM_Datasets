To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RDCNet: Instance segmentation with a minimalist recurrent residual network" by Raphael Ortiz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method on three different datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names and descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments & Results)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets they used. The section is divided into subsections that detail each dataset:

1. **CVPPP2017**: This dataset is described as a plant leaf segmentation dataset. The authors mention that it consists of 128 images from the A1 subset, which they split into training, validation, and test sets. They also provide details about the training process, including the scaling factor and margin used in their loss function.

2. **MoNuSeg**: This dataset is a nuclei segmentation dataset composed of digital pathology images from seven different organs. The authors specify the number of images used for training, validation, and testing, as well as the scaling factor and margin for the loss function.

3. **3D-ORG**: This dataset consists of 49 3D image stacks of developing organoids acquired with light-sheet microscopy. The authors describe how they split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets and provide details about the voxel spacing and the annotation process.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **CVPPP2017**, the citation is:
  > Minervini, M., Fischbach, A., Scharr, H., & Tsaftaris, S. (2015). Plant phenotyping datasets. Retrieved from http://www.plant-phenotyping.org/datasets

- For **MoNuSeg**, the citation is:
  > Kumar, N., Verma, R., Anand, D., et al. (2019). A Multi-organ Nucleus Segmentation Challenge. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 1â€“1.

- For **3D-ORG**, the citation is:
  > Weigert, M., Schmidt, U., Haase, R., Sugawara, K., & Myers, G. (2020). Star-convex polyhedra for 3D object detection and segmentation in microscopy. In Proceedings of the IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV).

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
