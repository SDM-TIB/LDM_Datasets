To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Linear Shape Deformation Models with Local Support using Graph-based Structured Matrix Factorisation" by Florian Bernard et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference datasets that are relevant to their work. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to previous studies that utilized specific datasets.

In the **methods section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. This section typically outlines the experimental setup, including the datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study. 

I will also examine the **experimental results section**, as it often contains information about the datasets used for validation and testing, including any performance metrics reported on those datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

From my reading, I expect to find at least two datasets mentioned:

1. **Brain Structures Dataset**: The paper states that it comprises 8 brain structure meshes of K=17 subjects, with a total of N=1792 vertices. The authors reference a previous work for this dataset.
   
2. **Human Body Shapes Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1531 female human body shapes, each with 12500 vertices. The authors acknowledge the source of this dataset in the acknowledgments section.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets based on the references provided in the paper:

- For the **Brain Structures Dataset**, the citation is:
  > F. Bernard, N. Vlassis, P. Gemmar, A. Husch, J. Thunberg, J. Goncalves, and F. Hertel. *Fast correspondences for statistical shape models of brain structures*. In SPIE Medical Imaging, San Diego, 2016.

- For the **Human Body Shapes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. Yang, Y. Yu, Y. Zhou, S. Du, J. Davis, and R. Yang. *Semantic Parametric Reshaping of Human Body Models*. In Proceedings of the 2014 Second International Conference on 3D Vision-Volume 02, pages 41â€“48. IEEE Computer Society, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented each dataset along with its citation for future reference or processing.
