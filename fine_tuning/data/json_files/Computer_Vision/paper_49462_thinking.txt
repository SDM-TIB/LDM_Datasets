To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Learning of Anomalous Diffusion Data" by Gorka Muñoz-Gil et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly **Section I C (Anomalous Diffusion Data)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention that the datasets consist of trajectories generated from various anomalous diffusion models, specifically:

1. **Annealed Transient Time Motion (ATTM)**: This model is referenced as one of the four different models used to generate trajectories.
2. **Continuous-Time Random Walk (CTRW)**: Another model mentioned for generating trajectories.
3. **Fractional Brownian Motion (FBM)**: This model is also included in the dataset description.
4. **Lévy Walk (LW)**: This model is part of the dataset as well.
5. **Scaled Brownian Motion (SBM)**: The last model mentioned in the context of the datasets.

The authors also indicate that the trajectories were generated using the **ANDI dataset python package**, which is crucial for understanding the source of the data.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets and models mentioned. The citations for the models used in the study are as follows:

- For **ATTM**, the citation is:
  > P. Massignan, C. Manzo, J.A. Torreno-Pina, M.F. García-Parajo, M. Lewenstein, and G.J. Lapeyre Jr. *Nonergodic subdiffusion from Brownian motion in an inhomogeneous medium*. Physical Review Letters, 112(15):150603, 2014.

- For **CTRW**, the citation is:
  > H. Scher and E.W. Montroll. *Anomalous transit-time dispersion in amorphous solids*. Physical Review B, 12(6):2455, 1975.

- For **FBM**, the citation is:
  > B.B. Mandelbrot and J.W. Van Ness. *Fractional Brownian motions, fractional noises and applications*. SIAM Review, 10(4):422–437, 1968.

- For **LW**, the citation is:
  > J. Klafter and G. Zumofen. *Lévy statistics in a Hamiltonian system*. Physical Review E, 49(6):4873, 1994.

- For **SBM**, the citation is:
  > S.C. Lim and S.V. Muniandy. *Self-similar Gaussian processes for modeling anomalous diffusion*. Physical Review E, 66(2):021114, 2002.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and full citation.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper, which is essential for proper documentation and future reference.
