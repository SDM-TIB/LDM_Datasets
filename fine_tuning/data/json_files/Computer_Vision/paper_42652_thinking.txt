To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Arbitrary-Oriented Object Detection: Classification based Approaches Revisited" by Xue Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the release of the **OHD-SJTU dataset** for heading detection, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of this dataset in the context of their proposed methods.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the introduction, the authors state that they release the **OHD-SJTU dataset** for rotation detection and object heading detection. They also mention that this dataset is the first public benchmark for multiple categories of heading detection.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used for their evaluations. They mention the following datasets:

1. **DOTA (Dataset for Object Detection in Aerial Images)**: This dataset is described as one of the largest aerial image detection benchmarks, containing 15 common object categories and 188,282 instances. 

2. **HRSC2016**: This dataset is used for ship detection in aerial imagery and includes images collected from various harbors.

3. **ICDAR2015**: This dataset is used for oriented scene text detection and includes 1,000 training images and 500 testing images.

4. **OHD-SJTU**: This is the new dataset introduced by the authors, which includes two scales: OHD-SJTU-S and OHD-SJTU-L, with detailed annotations for object heading detection.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

- For **DOTA**, the citation is:
  > G.-S. Xia, X. Bai, J. Ding, Z. Zhu, S. Belongie, J. Luo, M. Datcu, M. Pelillo, and L. Zhang. *DOTA: A large-scale dataset for object detection in aerial images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2018, pp. 3974–3983.

- For **HRSC2016**, the citation is:
  > Z. Liu, L. Yuan, L. Weng, and Y. Yang. *A high resolution optical satellite image dataset for ship recognition and some new baselines*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Pattern Recognition Applications and Methods, 2017, pp. 324–331.

- For **ICDAR2015**, the citation is:
  > D. Karatzas, L. Gomez-Bigorda, A. Nicolaou, S. Ghosh, A. Bagdanov, M. Iwamura, J. Matas, L. Neumann, V. R. Chandrasekhar, S. Lu et al. *ICDAR 2015 competition on robust reading*. In 2015 13th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, 2015, pp. 1156–1160.

- For **OHD-SJTU**, the citation is:
  > Xue Yang, Junchi Yan, and Tao He. *OHD-SJTU: A dataset for rotation detection and object heading detection*. Available at: https://yangxue0827.github.io/OHD-SJTU.html.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details for future reference or processing.
