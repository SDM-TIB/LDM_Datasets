To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LaTeRF: Label and Text Driven Object Radiance Fields" by Ashkan Mirzaei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate high-fidelity object extraction on both synthetic and real-world datasets. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors discuss the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they mention using a subset of real-world scenes borrowed from **NeRD**, scenes they collected themselves, and a collection of synthetic scenes designed for quantitative studies. This gives me three potential datasets to document.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets:

1. **NeRD Dataset**: The authors reference NeRD in their experiments, which is a dataset for neural reflectance decomposition. The citation is:
   > Boss, M., Braun, R., Jampani, V., Barron, J.T., Liu, C., Lensch, H. (2021). *NeRD: Neural Reflectance Decomposition from Image Collections*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

2. **British Museumâ€™s Photogrammetry Dataset**: The authors mention that some scenes in NeRD are from this dataset. The citation is:
   > Pett, D. (2017). *BritishMuseumDH/moldGoldCape: First release of the Cape in 3D*. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.344914.

3. **Synthetic Dataset**: The authors created their own synthetic dataset using Blender, which is not directly cited in the references but is described in detail in the paper. Since it is an original dataset created by the authors, I will note it as such without a formal citation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the citations are accurate and complete. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
