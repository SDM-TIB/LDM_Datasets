To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tesla-Rapture: A Lightweight Gesture Recognition System from mmWave Radar Point Clouds" by Dariush Salami et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on two datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Evaluation)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they refer to two datasets:

1. **Pantomime Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing point clouds of gestures captured by a mmWave radar. The authors mention that the gestures in this dataset are divided into three sets based on execution difficulty: Easy, Complex, and All.

2. **RadHAR Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned as being used for evaluation, specifically for human activity recognition from point clouds generated through a millimeter-wave radar.

To ensure I have the correct details, I will look for any specific descriptions or characteristics of these datasets in the text, such as the number of classes, environments, or any unique features.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Pantomime Dataset**, the citation is:
> Palipana, S., Salami, D., Leiva, L. A., & Sigg, S. (2021). *Pantomime: Mid-air gesture recognition with sparse millimeter-wave radar point clouds*. Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies, 5(1), 1-27.

For the **RadHAR Dataset**, the citation is:
> Singh, A. D., Sandha, S. S., Garcia, L., & Srivastava, M. (2019). *RadHAR: Human activity recognition from point clouds generated through a millimeter-wave radar*. In Proceedings of the 3rd ACM Workshop on Millimeter-wave Networks and Sensing Systems (pp. 51-56).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately and can be easily referenced in future work.
