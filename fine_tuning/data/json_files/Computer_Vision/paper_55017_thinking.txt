To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ensembled Autoencoder Regularization for Multi-Structure Segmentation for Kidney Cancer Treatment" by David Jozef Hresko et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on segmentation for kidney cancer treatment, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. 

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of kidney cancer treatment and the importance of organ delineation, but it does not specify any datasets.

I will then focus on the **data section** (Section 2), where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they acquired data from a Siemens dual-source 64-slice CT scanner, which consists of **130 3D abdominal CT images**. The ground truth for four classes (kidney, tumor, vein, and artery) was determined by medically trained experts. This section provides essential details about the dataset, including the number of images and the classes involved.

Now, I will look for any references to the dataset in the **references section** to provide full citations. However, the paper does not cite a specific dataset in the references; it primarily discusses the methodology and results based on the data they collected.

Since the dataset is described in detail but lacks a formal citation, I will note that the dataset is derived from a specific imaging technique (Siemens dual-source 64-slice CT scanner) and is internally validated by experts, but it does not have a formal publication or citation associated with it.

In summary, I will create an entry for the dataset based on the information provided in the data section, noting that it is a custom dataset created for this study without a formal citation. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
