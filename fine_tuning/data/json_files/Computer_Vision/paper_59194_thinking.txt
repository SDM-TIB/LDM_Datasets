To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion in the Dark: A Diffusion Model for Low-Light Text Recognition" by Cindy M. Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a diffusion model for low-light image reconstruction, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the evaluation of the proposed method.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the provided text, I find that the authors explicitly mention using the **LOw-Light (LOL) dataset** for training and evaluation. This dataset is described as containing 485 training and 15 test low-light/well-lit pairs, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

Additionally, the authors reference the **Seeing in the Dark (SID)** dataset, which consists of low-light RAW data. This dataset is also mentioned in the context of testing the model's performance on real low-light data.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **LOw-Light (LOL) Dataset**:
   - Citation: 
     > Wei, C., Wang, W., Yang, W., & Liu, J. (2018). Deep retinex decomposition for low-light enhancement. *British Machine Vision Conference*.

2. **Seeing in the Dark (SID) Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Chen, C., Chen, Q., Xu, J., & Koltun, V. (2018). Learning to see in the dark. *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition*.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that highlights the dataset names, descriptions, and citations. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented for future reference or analysis.
