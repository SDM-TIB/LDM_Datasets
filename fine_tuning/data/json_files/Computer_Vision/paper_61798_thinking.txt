To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mega-TTS: Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech at Scale with Intrinsic Inductive Bias" by Ziyue Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their model on "large-scale wild data," which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention using **GigaSpeech** and **WenetSpeech** as training datasets, which are crucial for understanding the scale and diversity of the data used.

I will also check the **evaluation datasets** mentioned in the experiments section. The authors specify that they evaluated their model on the **VCTK dataset** and **LibriSpeech test-clean** dataset. This is important as it shows the datasets used for performance evaluation.

Now, I will gather the necessary details for each dataset:

1. **GigaSpeech**: This dataset is described as containing 20k hours of multi-domain speech data in English and Chinese. I will need to find the full citation for this dataset in the references section.

2. **WenetSpeech**: Similar to GigaSpeech, this dataset also contains a significant amount of speech data. I will look for its citation as well.

3. **VCTK dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as containing 108 speakers and is used for evaluation. I will find its citation.

4. **LibriSpeech test-clean**: This dataset is noted for containing 40 speakers and is also used for evaluation. I will find its citation.

After identifying these datasets, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:

- For **GigaSpeech**, the citation is:
  > Guoguo Chen, Shuzhou Chai, Guanbo Wang, Jiayu Du, Wei-Qiang Zhang, Chao Weng, Dan Su, Daniel Povey, Jan Trmal, Junbo Zhang, et al. *Gigaspeech: An evolving, multi-domain ASR corpus with 10,000 hours of transcribed audio*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.06909, 2021.

- For **WenetSpeech**, the citation is:
  > Binbin Zhang, Hang Lv, Pengcheng Guo, Qijie Shao, Chao Yang, Lei Xie, Xin Xu, Hui Bu, Xiaoyu Chen, Chenchen Zeng, et al. *WenetSpeech: A 10000+ hours multi-domain Mandarin corpus for speech recognition*. In ICASSP 2022-2022 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 6182–6186. IEEE, 2022.

- For **VCTK dataset**, the citation is:
  > Christophe Veaux, Junichi Yamagishi, Kirsten MacDonald, et al. *Superseded-CSTR VCTK corpus: English multi-speaker corpus for CSTR voice cloning toolkit*. 2016.

- For **LibriSpeech test-clean**, the citation is:
  > Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. *Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In 2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206–5210. IEEE, 2015.

With all this information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
