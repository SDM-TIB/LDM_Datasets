To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretable Mechanistic Representations for Meal-level Glycemic Control in the Wild" by Ke Alexander Wang and Emily B. Fox, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a dataset of continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and self-reported meals from individuals with type-2 diabetes and pre-diabetes. This suggests that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly **section 4 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention the **Keto-Med dataset**, which is a randomized crossover trial involving participants with type-2 diabetes or pre-diabetes. The authors provide specific details about the dataset, including the number of participants and the nature of the data collected.

The paper states that the Keto-Med dataset includes CGM and self-reported meal data, which is crucial for their analysis. They also mention that the dataset consists of 964 postprandial glucose response (PPGR) time-series from 33 individuals, which is a significant detail for understanding the dataset's scope.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the Keto-Med dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **Keto-Med dataset**: 
  > Matthew J. Landry, Anthony Crimarco, Dalia Perelman, Lindsay R. Durand, Christina Petlura, Lucia Aronica, Jennifer L. Robinson, Sun H. Kim, and Christopher D. Gardner. *Adherence to Ketogenic and Mediterranean Study Diets in a Crossover Trial: The Ketoâ€“Med Randomized Trial*. Nutrients, 13(3):967, March 2021. doi: 10.3390/nu13030967. URL: https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/3/967.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and ensure that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the study, which is essential for any further analysis or replication of the research.
