To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compositional Attention Networks for Machine Reasoning" by Drew A. Hudson and Christopher D. Manning, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **CLEVR dataset** for visual reasoning, which indicates that a dataset is involved. I will note this down as a potential dataset.

Next, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors refer to the **CLEVR task** and cite Johnson et al. (2017a), which suggests that the CLEVR dataset is central to their work. I will confirm this by checking the **experiments section**.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their model on the **CLEVR dataset**, which consists of rendered images and machine-generated questions. This section provides details about the dataset's purpose and the reasoning skills it tests, confirming its significance in the study.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CLEVR dataset. The relevant citation is:
> Justin Johnson, Bharath Hariharan, Laurens van der Maaten, Li Fei-Fei, C Lawrence Zitnick, and Ross Girshick. *CLEVR: A diagnostic dataset for compositional language and elementary visual reasoning*. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017 IEEE Conference on, pp. 1988â€“1997, 2017.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the steps I took include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction to identify mentions of datasets.
2. Confirming the dataset's significance in the experiments section.
3. Retrieving the full citation from the references section.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture the relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
