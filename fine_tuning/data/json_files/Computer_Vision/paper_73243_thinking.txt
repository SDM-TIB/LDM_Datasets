To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Disentangle Sample Size and Initialization Effect on Perfect Generalization for Single-Neuron Target" by Jiajie Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on sample size and initialization effects, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is where datasets are typically described. In this paper, the authors discuss their experimental setup in **section 3.3 (Experimental setup)**, where they mention sampling data points from a target function. However, they do not specify a named dataset but rather describe the data generation process.

I will also check the **related works section** and the **conclusion** for any references to datasets used in previous studies that might be relevant to their work. However, it appears that the authors primarily focus on theoretical constructs and empirical results without referencing specific datasets.

Since the paper does not provide any named datasets or specific references to datasets in the **References section**, I will conclude that there are no formal datasets to extract from this paper. 

If there were datasets mentioned, I would ensure to extract the following information for each dataset:
1. **Name**: The title or name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and contents.
3. **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset, which is crucial for proper attribution.

In this case, since no datasets are explicitly mentioned, I will not be able to provide any dataset entries or citations. 

Overall, my approach involved carefully reading through the relevant sections of the paper to identify any datasets, but in this instance, it appears that the authors did not utilize any specific datasets that can be cited.
