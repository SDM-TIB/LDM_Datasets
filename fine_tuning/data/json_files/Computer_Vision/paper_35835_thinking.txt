To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differentially Private Generative Adversarial Network" by Liyang Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on various benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets**. In this paper, the relevant section is **Section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experiments and the datasets used. I will carefully read through this section to identify the specific datasets mentioned.

In **Section 4.1**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for evaluation:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This is a well-known dataset consisting of handwritten digits, commonly used for training various image processing systems. The authors use it to evaluate the performance of their model in generating high-quality images while maintaining privacy.

2. **MIMIC-III Dataset**: This dataset contains electronic health records of over 46,520 ICU patients. The authors utilize this dataset to demonstrate the application of their model in generating synthetic health records while ensuring patient privacy.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 2010. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For the **MIMIC-III Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alistair E.W. Johnson, Tom J. Pollard, Lu Shen, Li-wei H. Lehman, Mengling Feng, Mohammad Ghassemi, Benjamin Moody, Peter Szolovits, Leo Anthony Celi, and Roger G. Mark. *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific Data, 3, 2016.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for further processing or review.
