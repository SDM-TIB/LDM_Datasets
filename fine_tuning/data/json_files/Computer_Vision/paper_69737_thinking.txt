To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Network Diffusion" by Kai Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their approach across various architectures and datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets evaluated, which include:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits, consisting of 70,000 images (60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing).
2. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
3. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images.
4. **ImageNet-1K**: A large-scale dataset with 1,000 categories, comprising 1,281,167 training images and 50,000 validation images.
5. **STL-10**: A dataset with 96x96 color images across 10 different object categories, designed for various computer vision tasks.
6. **Flowers**: A dataset with 102 flower categories, commonly used for image classification tasks.
7. **Pets**: A dataset containing around 7,000 images of 37 different pet breeds.
8. **F-101**: A dataset with 365,000 images crawled from various sources, categorized according to the Food-101 taxonomy.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
