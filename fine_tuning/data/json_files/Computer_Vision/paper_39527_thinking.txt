To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-scale Cross-form Pyramid Network for Stereo Matching" by Zhidong Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method has been evaluated on the **Scene Flow** and **KITTI** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. In section III (Experiments), the authors explicitly mention the datasets:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: This dataset consists of real-world street views captured from a driving car, including both KITTI-2012 and KITTI-2015 stereo datasets. The authors note that it contains stereo image pairs and ground-truth disparity with a resolution of 376 × 1280.

2. **Scene Flow Dataset**: This is a synthetic dataset that includes 35,454 training stereo image pairs and 4,370 testing stereo image pairs, all with dense and elaborate ground-truth disparities. The resolution for both the training and validation sets is 540 × 960.

To ensure accuracy, I will check the **References section** for the full citations of these datasets:

- For the **KITTI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Geiger, P. Lenz, and R. Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In 2012 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3354–3361, June 2012.

- For the **Scene Flow Dataset**, the citation is:
  > N. Mayer, E. Ilg, P. Hausser, P. Fischer, D. Cremers, A. Dosovitskiy, and T. Brox. *A large dataset to train convolutional networks for disparity, optical flow, and scene flow estimation*. In IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset used in the research.
