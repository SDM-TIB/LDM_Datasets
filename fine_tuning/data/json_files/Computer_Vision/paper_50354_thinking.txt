To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An In-depth Summary of Recent Artificial Intelligence Applications in Drug Design" by Yi Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on AI applications in drug design, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide context or references to specific datasets used in the applications discussed.

Next, I will look for sections that detail the **applications of AI in drug design**. This includes sections that describe various AI models and their applications, as these sections often mention specific datasets used for training or evaluation. I will pay particular attention to any tables or figures that summarize datasets or applications, as these can be rich sources of information.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets that are explicitly named or described, including their characteristics, sizes, and the specific applications they are used for. I will also look for any references to previous works that may have introduced these datasets, as they will be crucial for providing full citations.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is critical, as proper attribution is essential in academic writing.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "ChEMBL database," I would look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail. The citation might look something like this:
> Gaulton, A., Bellis, L. J., Bento, A. P., Chambers, J., Davies, M., Hersey, A., ... & Overington, J. P. (2012). ChEMBL: a large-scale bioactivity database for drug discovery. Nucleic acids research, 40(D1), D1100-D1107.

After compiling the necessary information, I will ensure that each dataset is described clearly, including its name, purpose, and any relevant details, along with the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.

Finally, I will organize all the extracted information in a structured format for easy reference and review, ensuring that it is ready for any further processing or analysis.
