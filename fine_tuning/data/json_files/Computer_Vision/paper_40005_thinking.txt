To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Synthesizing Diverse Lung Nodules Wherever Massively: 3D Multi-Conditional GAN-based CT Image Augmentation for Object Detection" by Changhee Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a 3D conditional GAN for generating synthetic lung nodules, which suggests that there may be a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsection titled **Data Preparation**. Here, the authors mention using the **Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) dataset**, which contains 1,018 chest CT scans with lung nodules. This is a key dataset for their research.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned throughout the paper. In this case, the LIDC dataset appears to be the primary dataset used for training the GAN model. The authors describe how they filtered the dataset based on specific criteria (e.g., slice thickness and pixel spacing) and how they annotated the nodules for training.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the LIDC dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For the **LIDC dataset**:
  > Armato III, S. G., McLennan, G., Bidaut, L., McNitt-Gray, M. F., Meyer, C. R., et al. (2011). The lung image database consortium (LIDC) and image database resource initiative (IDRI): a completed reference database of lung nodules on CT scans. *Medical Physics*, 38(2), 915â€“931.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about the dataset, including its citation, into the required format.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is clear and includes all necessary details, ready for further processing or review.
