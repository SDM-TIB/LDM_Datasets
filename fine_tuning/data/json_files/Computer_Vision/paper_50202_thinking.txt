To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pharmacoprint – a combination of pharmacophore fingerprint and artificial intelligence as a tool for computer-aided drug design" by Dawid Warszycki et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets or databases used in the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the significance of pharmacophore modeling and fingerprinting in cheminformatics, but I need to look for specific datasets. 

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention that they selected **15 protein targets from the ChEMBL database (version 26)**, which is crucial information. I will note that the ChEMBL database is a key dataset used in their study.

In the **results section**, the authors provide details about the datasets, including the number of active and inactive compounds for each target. They also mention the use of the **ZINC database** for selecting putative inactives, which is another important dataset.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **ChEMBL Database**: The citation for the ChEMBL database is:
   > Gaulton, A.; Hersey, A.; Nowotka, M.; Bento, A. P.; Chambers, J.; Mendez, D.; Mutowo, P.; Atkinson, F.; Bellis, L. J.; Cibrián-Uhalte, E.; Davies, M.; Dedman, N.; Karlsson, A.; Magariños, M. P.; Overington, J. P.; Papadatos, G.; Smit, I.; Leach, A. R. The ChEMBL Database in 2017. *Nucleic Acids Res.* 2017, 45(D1), D945–D954. https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkw1074.

2. **ZINC Database**: The citation for the ZINC database is:
   > Irwin, J. J.; Shoichet, B. K. ZINC - A Free Database of Commercially Available Compounds for Virtual Screening. *J. Chem. Inf. Model.* 2005, 45(1), 177–182. https://doi.org/10.1021/ci049512.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure to format the information clearly and accurately for any further processing or documentation needs. This structured approach will help in systematically extracting and documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
