To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Kernel-convoluted Deep Neural Networks with Data Augmentation" by Minjin Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention using **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets for their experiments, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to gather more details about how these datasets were utilized. The authors provide a description of both datasets in the context of their experiments. They mention that the **CIFAR-10 dataset** consists of 60,000 RGB images across 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class, while the **CIFAR-100 dataset** contains 100 classes with 600 images each. This information is essential for understanding the datasets' structure and purpose.

I will also check the **related works** and **discussion sections** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or referenced. However, the primary focus remains on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, as these are the datasets used for the experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 

- For **CIFAR-100**:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*.

Both datasets are derived from the same source, and the citation reflects their origin.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the necessary details about the datasets used in the research paper.
