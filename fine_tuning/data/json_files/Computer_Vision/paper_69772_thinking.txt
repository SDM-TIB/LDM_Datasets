To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VOOM: Robust Visual Object Odometry and Mapping using Hierarchical Landmarks" by Yutong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of accurate localization and mapping, which suggests that they may have used specific datasets for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section**. Here, the authors detail their experiments and comparisons with other methods. They mention using the **TUM RGB-D dataset** and **LM-Data** for their experiments. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their evaluation.

I will then look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the paper. The authors may provide specific characteristics, such as the number of sequences, types of data included, or any particular features that are relevant to their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is critical for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For the **TUM RGB-D dataset**, the citation is:
> J. Sturm, N. Engelhard, F. Endres, W. Burgard, and D. Cremers. *A benchmark for the evaluation of RGB-D SLAM systems*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Intelligent Robot Systems (IROS), Oct. 2012.

For the **LM-Data**, the citation is:
> S. Saeedi, E. D. Carvalho, W. Li, D. Tzoumanikas, S. Leutenegger, P. H. Kelly, and A. J. Davison. *Characterizing visual localization and mapping datasets*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation (ICRA), 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset used in the research.
