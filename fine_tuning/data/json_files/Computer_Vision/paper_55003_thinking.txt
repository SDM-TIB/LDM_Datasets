To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Clear Memory-Augmented Auto-Encoder for Surface Defect Detection" by Wei Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges in surface defect detection and hints at the use of datasets for training and evaluation, which suggests that datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention using the **MV-TAD dataset** and the **DAGM dataset** for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about these datasets.

1. **MV-TAD Dataset**: The authors state that they conducted experiments on five benchmark textured surfaces sourced from the MV-TAD dataset. This dataset is crucial for evaluating the performance of their proposed method.

2. **DAGM Dataset**: The authors also mention conducting experiments on four challenging textured surfaces from the DAGM dataset, which further validates the generalizability of their method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. 

- For the **MV-TAD dataset**, the citation is:
  > P. Bergmann, M. Fauser, D. Sattlegger, and C. Steger. "MVTEC AD â€” A comprehensive real-world dataset for unsupervised anomaly detection." In *Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition*, 2019.

- For the **DAGM dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Wieler and T. Hahn. "Weakly supervised learning for industrial optical inspection." In *DAGM Symposium*, 2007.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that I include the full citations as they are critical for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
