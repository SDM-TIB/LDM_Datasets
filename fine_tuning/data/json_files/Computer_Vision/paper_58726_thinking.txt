To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LayoutDiffuse: Adapting Foundational Diffusion Models for Layout-to-Image Generation" by Jiaxin Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on three datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details of these datasets.

Next, I will navigate to **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **CelebA-Mask**: This dataset is used for evaluating mask layout-to-image performance. It consists of 30,000 facial images along with corresponding semantic masks that cover 19 facial attribute classes. The authors also mention that they benchmark performance on a test split of 2,993 images.

2. **COCO Stuff**: This dataset is utilized for bounding box layout-to-image performance. The authors filtered the number of objects in images from 3 to 8 and eliminated objects smaller than 2% of the image area, resulting in 112,680 training samples and 3,097 testing samples across 171 classes.

3. **Visual Genome (VG)**: Similar to COCO Stuff, this dataset is also used for bounding box layout-to-image performance. The authors filtered the number of objects from 3 to 30, resulting in 62,565 training samples and 5,062 testing samples across 178 categories.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CelebA-Mask**, the citation is:
  > Cheng-Han Lee, Ziwei Liu, Lingyun Wu, and Ping Luo. *MaskGAN: Towards Diverse and Interactive Facial Image Manipulation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 5549–5558, 2020.

- For **COCO Stuff**, the citation is:
  > Holger Caesar, Jasper Uijlings, and Vittorio Ferrari. *COCO-Stuff: Thing and Stuff Classes in Context*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1209–1218, 2018.

- For **Visual Genome**, the citation is:
  > Ranjay Krishna, Yuke Zhu, Oliver Groth, Justin Johnson, Kenji Hata, Joshua Kravitz, Stephanie Chen, Yannis Kalandidis, Li-Jia Li, David A Shamma, et al. *Visual Genome: Connecting Language and Vision Using Crowdsourced Dense Image Annotations*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 123(1):32–73, 2017.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any critical details or citations.
