To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Seeking Next Layer Neurons’ Attention for Error-Backpropagation-Like Training in a Multi-Agent Network Framework" by Arshia Soltani Moakhar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors demonstrate the learning capacity of their multi-agent neural networks through experiments on **three datasets**. This indicates that datasets are indeed involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors describe their methodology and results. In **Section 4.1 (Classification)**, they mention using **MNIST**, **CIFAR-10**, and **CIFAR-100** datasets for their experiments. This is a clear identification of the datasets used.

I will also look for any additional details about these datasets in the **datasets section** (B.1), where the authors provide descriptions of each dataset:

1. **MNIST**: A dataset of 60,000 grayscale handwritten digit images, with each image belonging to one of ten classes. It has a resolution of 28 × 28 pixels.

2. **Split-MNIST**: A variation of the MNIST dataset, where the ten classes are divided into five distinct groups for binary classification tasks.

3. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset comprising 60,000 natural images, each assigned to one of ten distinct classes, with a resolution of 32 × 32 pixels.

4. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **MNIST**:
  > LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., & Haffner, P. (1998). Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition. *Proceedings of the IEEE*, 86(11), 2278-2324.

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. *Technical Report*, University of Toronto.

- For **CIFAR-100**:
  > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. *Technical Report*, University of Toronto.

With these citations, I have all the necessary information to create structured entries for each dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or downstream processing.
