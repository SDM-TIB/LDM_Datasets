To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Hidden Linear Structure in Score-Based Models and its Application" by Binxu Wang and John J. Vastola, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for validation or experiments. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (which is often where datasets are detailed) to find explicit mentions of datasets. In this paper, the authors refer to several image datasets used for empirical validation, specifically **CIFAR10, FFHQ64, and AFHQv2-64**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including the number of samples and resolution.

In the **detailed methods section**, I will look for a table or a list that summarizes the datasets, which is often included in research papers. In this case, there is a table that specifies the dataset names, number of samples, and resolutions, which confirms the datasets I need to extract.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. 

For the datasets mentioned:
1. **CIFAR10**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: Canadian Institute for Advanced Research*. 2009.

2. **FFHQ64**: The citation is:
   > Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. *A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 4401–4410, 2019.

3. **AFHQv2-64**: The citation is:
   > Yunjin Chen, Jaejun Yoo, and Jaehoon Kim. *Stargan v2: Diverse image synthesis for multiple domains*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 8188–8197, 2020.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, number of samples, resolution, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
