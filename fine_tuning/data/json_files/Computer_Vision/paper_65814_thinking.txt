To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Data Augmentations on Self-/Semi-/Fully- Supervised Pre-trained Models" by Shentong Mo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions conducting an empirical study on data augmentations, but it does not specify datasets yet. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss self-/semi-/fully-supervised contrastive learning and mention that they apply data augmentations to various tasks. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets here. I will continue to the methodology and experiments sections for more details.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe their approach but still do not mention specific datasets. I will now check the **experiments section**, where they report results on various downstream tasks. Here, they mention using **ImageNet-100** and **ImageNet-1K** as the pre-training datasets for their experiments. This is a crucial finding, as these datasets are widely recognized in the field.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **ImageNet-100**, the citation is:
  > Kaiming He, Georgia Gkioxari, Piotr Dollár, and Ross Girshick. *Mask R-CNN*. In IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2980–2988, 2017.

- For **ImageNet-1K**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211–252, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **ImageNet-100**: A subset of the ImageNet dataset used for evaluating linear classification performance.
2. **ImageNet-1K**: A larger dataset used for various downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation.

I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
