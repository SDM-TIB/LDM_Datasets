To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parallelizing Autoregressive Generation with Variational State Space Models" by Gaspard Lambrechts et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on experiments** or **datasets**. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments in section 4. I will carefully read through this section to identify any datasets that were utilized for training or evaluation purposes. 

In section 4, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on two toy sequence modeling tasks: **MNIST** and **CIFAR**. I will note these datasets as they are explicitly stated in the context of the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, and its citation is:

- For **MNIST Dataset**:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

The CIFAR dataset is also widely recognized for image classification tasks, and its citation is:

- For **CIFAR Dataset**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. [https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
