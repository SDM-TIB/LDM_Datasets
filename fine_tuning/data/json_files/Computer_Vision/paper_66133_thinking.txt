To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Kantian Deontology Meets AI Alignment: Towards Morally Grounded Fairness Metrics" by Carlos Mougan and Joshua Brand, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the integration of Kantian ethics into AI fairness metrics but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and case studies sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention two case studies: one on loan approval and another on a student grading system. I will focus on these sections to see if any datasets are referenced.

In the **loan approval case study**, the authors refer to an investigation by The Markup that analyzed mortgage application algorithms. I will check if they provide a specific dataset or source for this analysis. The paper mentions that the algorithm significantly disadvantaged applicants from racial minorities, but it does not provide a specific dataset name.

In the **student grading system case study**, the authors discuss the Ofqual exam grading controversy. They reference the algorithm used to determine student grades during the pandemic but again do not specify a dataset. 

Since the paper does not provide explicit datasets, I will look at the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the studies mentioned. The references include various works that may have utilized datasets relevant to the topics discussed, but I need to ensure they are datasets themselves.

After reviewing the references, I find that the paper cites several studies and reports, but none of them appear to be datasets. The references include works on algorithmic fairness and ethics, but they do not provide specific datasets used in the analysis.

Given this analysis, it seems that the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, I will note the relevant studies and reports that could potentially contain datasets related to the topics discussed:

1. **The Markup's investigation on mortgage algorithms** (no specific dataset mentioned).
2. **Ofqual exam grading controversy** (no specific dataset mentioned).

Since no datasets are explicitly provided in the paper, I will compile the findings and note the lack of specific datasets while referencing the relevant studies mentioned in the paper.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings, noting that while the paper discusses important case studies, it does not provide explicit datasets or their citations. This will be important for anyone looking to reference datasets in relation to the topics of AI fairness and Kantian ethics.
