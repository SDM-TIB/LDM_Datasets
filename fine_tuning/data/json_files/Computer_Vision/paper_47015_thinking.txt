To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Training Stacked Denoising Autoencoders for Representation Learning" by Jason Liang and Keith Kelly, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors analyze the performance of their autoencoders on standard image classification datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the **experiments section**, the authors specifically mention using the **MNIST dataset** for training their autoencoder. They describe the dataset as consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each being a greyscale image of size 28x28 pixels.

Additionally, they introduce variations of the MNIST dataset, which are:
1. **mnist-bg-rand**: MNIST images with a random background added.
2. **mnist-bg-img**: MNIST images with backgrounds selected from a set of images.
3. **mnist-rot**: MNIST images that have been rotated by random angles.

I will confirm these datasets by checking the **results** section, where the authors discuss the performance of their autoencoder on these datasets, further validating their usage.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The MNIST dataset is widely known, and its citation is as follows:
- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

The variations of the MNIST dataset (mnist-bg-rand, mnist-bg-img, mnist-rot) are derived from the original MNIST dataset, so I will use the same citation for these variations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and present the datasets used in the research paper.
