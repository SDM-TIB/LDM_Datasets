To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parallel Shooting Sequential Quadratic Programming for Nonlinear MPC Problems" by P. C. N. Verheijen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in benchmark examples for nonlinear model predictive control, which suggests that there may be datasets used for these benchmarks.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments or illustrative examples sections**. In this paper, the authors describe two illustrative examples: the **inverted pendulum** and a **small water distribution network**. I will check if these examples reference any publicly available datasets or if they are based on simulated data.

In the **illustrative examples section**, the authors provide details about the inverted pendulum system and the water distribution network. However, they do not mention any specific datasets that are publicly available or that can be cited. Instead, they describe the models and parameters used for simulations, which are not datasets in the traditional sense.

Since no explicit datasets are referenced in the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any cited works provide datasets that could be relevant to the experiments conducted in this study. The references include various papers on model predictive control and optimization methods, but they do not specifically mention datasets.

Given that the paper does not provide any datasets or references to datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this research paper. Therefore, I will not create any dataset entries or citations.

In summary, my steps were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Review the illustrative examples for any datasets used.
3. Check the references for any relevant datasets.
4. Conclude that no datasets are explicitly mentioned or cited in the paper.

Since there are no datasets to document, I will not proceed with creating any structured output.
