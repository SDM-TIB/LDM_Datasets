To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-time Multi-Class Helmet Violation Detection Using Few-Shot Data Sampling Technique and YOLOv8" by Armstrong Aboah et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, and it may mention the datasets used for training and testing.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to specific datasets or challenges related to helmet detection that might indicate the datasets used. The introduction often sets the context for the research and may highlight the importance of certain datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their helmet violation detection model. Here, they mention that the data was sourced from the **2023 NVIDIA AI City Challenge**, specifically Track 5, which focuses on detecting helmet rule violations. The dataset includes 100 videos for training and 100 videos for testing, each with specific characteristics such as average length, frame rate, and resolution.

I will also note any details about the dataset's content, such as the variety of conditions (lighting, weather) and the challenges faced in detecting helmet usage violations.

After identifying the dataset, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to the dataset. Since the dataset is sourced from a competition, it may not have a traditional citation format, but I will ensure to document it appropriately.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> NVIDIA AI City Challenge. *2023 AI City Challenge, Track 5: Helmet Rule Violations*. Available at: [NVIDIA AI City Challenge](https://www.aicitychallenge.org/).

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including its name, description, and citation, into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately and comprehensively.
