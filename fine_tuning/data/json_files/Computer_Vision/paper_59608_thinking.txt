To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Instruct-NeRF2NeRF: Editing 3D Scenes with Instructions" by Ayaan Haque et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses a method for editing NeRF scenes but does not specify any datasets. The introduction provides context about the need for 3D editing tools but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section** where the authors describe their approach in detail. Here, they mention using a reconstructed NeRF scene along with a set of captured images, camera poses, and calibration data. However, they do not name specific datasets in this section.

I will then check the **results section** where the authors describe their experiments. They mention editing various captured NeRF scenes, indicating that they used real-world data captured with smartphones and mirrorless cameras. They also refer to the use of COLMAP and PolyCam for extracting camera poses, but again, no specific datasets are named.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited. The references primarily consist of papers and tools related to NeRF and image editing, but they do not provide specific dataset citations.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors do not explicitly name any datasets used in their experiments. Instead, they refer to the general process of capturing images and extracting camera parameters without providing specific dataset titles or citations.

Since no specific datasets are mentioned in the paper, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract with full citations. If there were datasets mentioned, I would have documented them along with their citations as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Description of the dataset, including key features and size.
   - **Citation**: Full citation for the dataset as it appears in the references.

However, in this case, I will note that the paper does not provide specific datasets for citation.
