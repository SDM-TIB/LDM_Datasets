To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extracting Deformation-Aware Local Features by Learning to Deform" by Guilherme Potje et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experiments are conducted on "different datasets containing deformable objects," which indicates that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they specifically mention two datasets:

1. **GeoBit Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as containing color images of 11 deforming real-world objects, with keypoints detected using SIFT and ground-truth correspondences established following a specific protocol.

2. **DeSurT Dataset**: Similar to the GeoBit dataset, this dataset also contains color images of deformable objects and follows the same keypoint detection and correspondence protocol.

In the **results section**, the authors compare their method against various descriptors using these datasets, which confirms their relevance and importance in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

- For the **GeoBit Dataset**, the citation is:
  > E. R. Nascimento, G. Potje, R. Martins, F. Cadar, M. F. M. Campos, and R. Bajcsy. *GEOBIT: A geodesic-based binary descriptor invariant to non-rigid deformations for RGB-D images*. In 2019 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 10003â€“10011, 2019.

- For the **DeSurT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > T. Wang, H. Ling, C. Lang, S. Feng, and X. Hou. *Deformable surface tracking by graph matching*. In IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive summary of the datasets used in the research paper.
