To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding News Thumbnail Representativeness by Counterfactual Text-Guided Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining" by Yejun Yoon et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces **NEWSTT**, a manually annotated dataset of news thumbnail image and text pairs, which is a clear indication that a dataset is present.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of the dataset in the **Methods section**, specifically in **section 4 (NEWSTT: A Dataset of Thumbnail Representativeness for News Text)**. Here, the authors describe the dataset's creation process, including the raw data collection from the **NELA-GT-2021** corpus, which consists of 442,741 pairs of news headlines and thumbnail images. They also mention that the dataset was partitioned into training, validation, and test sets.

In this section, I will note the specifics of the **NEWSTT dataset**:
- It contains **1,000 news thumbnail and text pairs**, with **808 labeled as representative** and **192 as non-representative**. This dataset is crucial for evaluating the zero-shot ability of CLIP-like models.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

1. For **NELA-GT-2021**:
   > Gruppi, M., Horne, B. D., & AdalÄ±, S. (2022). NELA-GT-2021: A large multi-labelled news dataset for the study of misinformation in news articles. *ArXiv preprint*, abs/2203.05659.

2. For **NEWSTT**:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
