To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neuro-Inspired Fragmentation and Recall to Overcome Catastrophic Forgetting in Curiosity" by Jaedong Hwang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference datasets that are relevant to their work. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets that are used in their experiments.

Then, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." Here, I will note down the names, descriptions, and any relevant details about the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the **MiniGrid benchmark**, I will look for the citation that corresponds to this dataset. The citation might look something like this:
> Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert, Lucas Willems, and Suman Pal. *Minimalistic gridworld environment for openai gym*. https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid, 2018.

If they reference the **Atari benchmark suite**, I will find the appropriate citation, which could be:
> M. G. Bellemare, Y. Naddaf, J. Veness, and M. Bowling. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. JAIR, 47:253â€“279, 2013.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper, providing a comprehensive overview of the data used in the study.
