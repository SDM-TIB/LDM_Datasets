To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Survey on Generative Diffusion Models" by Hanqun Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the applications of diffusion models across various domains, but it does not specify any datasets. I will note this and move on.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly the sections that discuss applications and experiments. I will focus on sections that might detail specific datasets used in the context of generative diffusion models. 

In the **applications section**, the authors mention various applications of diffusion models, such as image generation, video generation, and medical analysis. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets in this section.

I will then check the **references** section to see if any datasets are cited in the context of the experiments or applications discussed. The references may provide insights into datasets that are commonly used in the field of generative models.

After reviewing the paper thoroughly, I will compile a list of any datasets mentioned, along with their full citations. If no specific datasets are identified, I will note that the paper serves more as a survey of methods and applications rather than a source of specific datasets.

Finally, I will ensure that I format the citations correctly, adhering to the citation style used in the paper, and provide a clear summary of each dataset, including its name, purpose, and any relevant details that may be mentioned in the paper.

If I find datasets, I will document them as follows:
1. **Dataset Name**: The name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any notable characteristics.
3. **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset, formatted according to the style used in the paper.

By following this structured approach, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document any datasets referenced in the paper.
