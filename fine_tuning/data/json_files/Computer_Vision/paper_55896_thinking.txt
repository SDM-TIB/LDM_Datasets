To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data Poisoning Attacks Against Multimodal Encoders" by Ziqing Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive evaluations on different datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, the authors mention two primary datasets: 

1. **Flickr-PASCAL**: This dataset is a combination of the Flickr and PASCAL datasets, used for training multimodal models. The authors describe it as containing a large number of image-caption pairs.

2. **COCO**: The COCO dataset is noted for its extensive use in object detection, segmentation, and captioning tasks. The authors provide details about how they selected images and captions for their experiments.

In the **appendix (A.1 Dataset)**, the authors provide further details about the datasets, including statistics such as the number of pairs, images, and classes. This section confirms the datasets used and provides additional context for their selection.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Flickr**:
  > Peter Young, Alice Lai, Micah Hodosh, and Julia Hockenmaier. *From image descriptions to visual denotations: New similarity metrics for semantic inference over event descriptions*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2014.

- For **PASCAL**:
  > Cyrus Rashtchian, Peter Young, Micah Hodosh, and Julia Hockenmaier. *Collecting Image Annotations Using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk*. In Workshop on Creating Speech and Language Data with Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (WCSLD), pages 139–147, ACL, 2010.

- For **COCO**:
  > Xinlei Chen, Hao Fang, Tsung-Yi Lin, Ramakrishna Vedantam, Saurabh Gupta, Piotr Dollár, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO Captions: Data Collection and Evaluation Server*. CoRR abs/1504.00325, 2015.

- For **Visual Genome**:
  > Ranjay Krishna, Yuke Zhu, Oliver Groth, Justin Johnson, Kenji Hata, Joshua Kravitz, Stephanie Chen, Yannis Kalanatidis, Li-Jia Li, David A. Shamma, Michael S. Bernstein, and Li Fei-Fei. *Visual Genome: Connecting Language and Vision Using Crowdsourced Dense Image Annotations*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
