To extract datasets from the research paper titled "QANA: LLM-based Question Generation and Network Analysis for Zero-shot Key Point Analysis and Beyond" by Tomoki Fukuma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions comparing the QANA framework with "annotated Key Point Analysis datasets," indicating that there are specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors provide more context about these datasets. They discuss the limitations of traditional summarization and introduce Key Point Analysis (KPA) as an alternative, but I need to find specific dataset names.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe their approach and mention the use of the **ArgKP-2021 dataset** for evaluating the Key Point Matching (KPM) task. This dataset is crucial for understanding how well their method performs against established benchmarks.

I will then check the **experimental results section** to confirm the use of the ArgKP-2021 dataset and to see if any additional datasets are mentioned. The authors specifically state that the ArgKP-2021 dataset contains arguments on 28 controversial topics, categorized by stance, which provides a clear description of its contents.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the ArgKP-2021 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Roni Friedman, Lena Dankin, Yufang Hou, Ranit Aharonov, Yoav Katz, and Noam Slonim. *Overview of the 2021 key point analysis shared task*. In Khalid Al-Khatib, Yufang Hou, and Manfred Stede (eds.), Proceedings of the 8th Workshop on Argument Mining, pp. 154â€“164, Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, November 2021. Association for Computational Linguistics. doi: 10.18653/v1/2021.argmining-1.16. URL https://aclanthology.org/2021.argmining-1.16.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the ArgKP-2021 dataset as it is essential for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent work.
