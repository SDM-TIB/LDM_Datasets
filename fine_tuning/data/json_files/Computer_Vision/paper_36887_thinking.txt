To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RETAIN: An Interpretable Predictive Model for Healthcare using Reverse Time Attention Mechanism" by Edward Choi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that RETAIN was tested on a large health system EHR dataset, which indicates that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to gather more context about the dataset. The authors discuss the importance of Electronic Health Records (EHR) and how they can be used for predictive modeling, which suggests that the dataset is related to EHR data.

In the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Experimental setting)**, the authors provide specific details about the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that the dataset consists of electronic health records from Sutter Health, specifically for patients aged 50 to 80 years old, with a total of 14 million visits completed by 263,683 patients over an 8-year period. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides key statistics.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details about the dataset, such as how the data was processed or any specific codes used. The authors mention using medical groupers to aggregate codes into input variables, which is important for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from a specific health system (Sutter Health), it may not have a formal citation like a published dataset. Instead, I will note that the dataset is based on EHR data from Sutter Health and provide a description of its characteristics.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Sutter Health EHR Dataset
   - **Description**: This dataset consists of electronic health records from Sutter Health, including 14 million visits completed by 263,683 patients aged 50 to 80 years over an 8-year period. It includes diagnosis, medication, and procedure codes aggregated into input variables.
   - **Citation**: Not formally cited; based on internal EHR data from Sutter Health.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and citation, even if it does not follow a traditional citation format.
