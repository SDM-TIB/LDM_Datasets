To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Symmetry-driven network reconstruction through pseudobalanced coloring optimization" by Ian Leifer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed method to the **C. elegans connectome**, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention that they apply their method to the **C. elegans connectome**, which is a well-known dataset in the field of neuroscience. I will need to confirm the details of this dataset in the text.

In the **Acknowledgements and Data Availability section**, the authors provide a link to their data repository, which is crucial for obtaining the dataset. They mention that all code and data are available at a specific URL, which I will note down.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets:

1. **C. elegans connectome**: This dataset is used for the experiments in the paper. It consists of the neural connections of the nematode C. elegans, which has been fully mapped and is a standard dataset in neuroscience research.

Next, I will look for the full citation for the **C. elegans connectome** dataset. The original mapping of the C. elegans connectome is referenced in the paper by White et al. (1986), which I will include as the citation for this dataset.

The citation for the C. elegans connectome is:
> White, J. G., Southgate, E., Thomson, J. N., & Brenner, S. (1986). *The structure of the nervous system of the nematode C. elegans*. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences, 314(1165), 1-340.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the C. elegans connectome dataset as it is essential for proper referencing.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise record of the datasets referenced in the paper, along with their citations, ready for further use or analysis.
