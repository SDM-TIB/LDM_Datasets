To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conditional variational autoencoder to improve neural audio synthesis for polyphonic music sound" by Seokjin Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **MAESTRO dataset** for evaluation, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In section 4.1, they explicitly state that they trained the enhanced RAVE model using the **MAESTRO dataset**. They mention that the training data comprised 374 piano clips, which provides some context about the dataset's content.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the **MAESTRO dataset** in the **References section**. The relevant citation is:
> C. Hawthorne, A. Stasyuk, A. Roberts, I. Simon, C.-Z. A. Huang, S. Dieleman, E. Elsen, J. Engel, and D. Eck. *Enabling factorized piano music modeling and generation with the MAESTRO dataset*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2019.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the **MAESTRO dataset** is the only dataset used in this research.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset, including its name, description, and full citation, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness. This will prepare me for the next steps in processing or presenting the extracted dataset information.
