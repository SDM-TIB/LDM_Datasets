To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VaLID: Variable-Length Input Diffusion for Novel View Synthesis" by Shijie Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted evaluations over multiple datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will move to the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In section 4.1, the authors mention that they fine-tuned their model on the **Objaverse dataset**, which contains over 800K high-quality 3D object CAD models. This is a significant dataset, and I will note its details.

The authors also mention using the **Google Scanned Objects dataset (GSO)** for evaluation, which contains high-quality scanned household items. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their method in real-world scenarios.

Additionally, they refer to the **RTMV dataset**, which provides complex scenes with around 20 random objects each. This dataset is also important for evaluating the robustness of their approach.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **Objaverse dataset**:
   > Matt Deitke, Dustin Schwenk, Jordi Salvador, Luca Weihs, Oscar Michel, Eli VanderBilt, Ludwig Schmidt, Kiana Ehsani, Aniruddha Kembhavi, and Ali Farhadi. *Objaverse: A universe of annotated 3D objects*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 13142–13153, 2023.

2. **Google Scanned Objects dataset**:
   > Laura Downs, Anthony Francis, Nate Koenig, Brandon Kinman, Ryan Hickman, Krista Reymann, Thomas B McHugh, and Vincent Vanhoucke. *Google scanned objects: A high-quality dataset of 3D scanned household items*. In International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pages 2553–2560. IEEE, 2022.

3. **RTMV dataset**:
   > Jonathan Tremblay, Moustafa Meshry, Alex Evans, Jan Kautz, Alexander Keller, Sameh Khamis, Thomas Müller, Charles Loop, Nathan Morrical, Koki Nagano, et al. *RTMV: A ray-traced multi-view synthetic dataset for novel view synthesis*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2205.07058, 2022.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details while extracting the datasets from the paper.
