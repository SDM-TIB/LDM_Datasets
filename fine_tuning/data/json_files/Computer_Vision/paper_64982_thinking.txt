To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DANI: Fast Diffusion Aware Network Inference with Preserving Topological Structure Property" by Maryam Ramezani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions that the authors applied their method to both real and synthetic networks, which indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section** (Section 6). Here, the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments, which include both synthetic and real datasets. 

1. **Synthetic Datasets**: The authors refer to the LFR benchmark datasets, which are generated with specific parameters to control community structure. They mention five synthetic networks (LFR1 to LFR5) with varying values of the parameter Âµ, which affects the community structure. The details of these datasets are summarized in Table 4 of the paper.

2. **Real Datasets**: The authors also mention five real datasets used for evaluation:
   - **LinkedIn Dataset**: Collected from LinkedIn, with specific characteristics outlined in Table 5.
   - **MemeTracker Dataset**: Collected from the MemeTracker project, which tracks meme propagation across online news websites.
   - **NBA Dataset**: A dataset related to the NBA, with specific characteristics provided.
   - **Twitter Dataset**: A dataset sampled from the Twitter streaming API, with preprocessing steps mentioned.
   - **World Dataset**: Another dataset with specific characteristics listed.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. For the synthetic datasets, the citation for the LFR benchmark is:
- **LFR Benchmark**: 
  > Andrea Lancichinetti and Santo Fortunato. *Benchmarks for testing community detection algorithms on directed and weighted graphs with overlapping communities*. Physical Review E, 80(1):016118, 2009.

For the real datasets, I will extract the citations as follows:
- **LinkedIn Dataset**: 
  > No specific citation is provided in the paper; it is based on data collected from LinkedIn.
  
- **MemeTracker Dataset**: 
  > Jure Leskovec, Lars Backstrom, and Jon Kleinberg. *Memetracker: tracking news phrases over the web*. 2008. URL: http://memetracker.org/.
  
- **NBA Dataset**: 
  > No specific citation is provided in the paper; it is based on data related to the NBA.
  
- **Twitter Dataset**: 
  > Weng, L., Menczer, F., & Ahn, Y.-Y. (2013). *Virality prediction and community structure in social networks*. Scientific Reports, 3, 2013.
  
- **World Dataset**: 
  > No specific citation is provided in the paper; it is based on data collected from various sources.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
