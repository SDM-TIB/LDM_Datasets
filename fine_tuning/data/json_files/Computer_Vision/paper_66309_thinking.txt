To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Detection of Phase Transitions with Multi-Task Learning-by-Confusion" by Julian Arnold et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors apply their method to the **Ising model** and an **image dataset generated with Stable Diffusion**, which suggests that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Benchmark and Application)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **Ising Model Dataset**: The authors describe how they generated this dataset by sampling spin configurations on a 60x60 lattice from Boltzmann distributions at 200 parameter values. This dataset is well-established in the literature, and I need to find the appropriate citation.

2. **Stable Diffusion Dataset**: This dataset consists of images generated using Stable Diffusion, where images are sampled with prompts corresponding to years. The authors mention that this dataset does not have a prior benchmark, which is important to note.

In the **References section**, I will look for citations related to both datasets:

- For the **Ising Model**, the relevant citation is:
  > L. Onsager, *Phys. Rev.* 65, 117 (1944). This paper is foundational for the Ising model and provides the theoretical background necessary for understanding the dataset.

- For the **Stable Diffusion Dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Rombach, A. Blattmann, D. Lorenz, P. Esser, and B. Ommer, *arXiv:2112.10752* (2021). This paper describes the Stable Diffusion model and its applications, including the dataset generation process.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have a clear and organized representation of the datasets extracted from the paper.
