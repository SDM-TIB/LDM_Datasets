To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Zero-Shot Learning via Class-Conditioned Deep Generative Models" by Wenlin Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors compare their model with several state-of-the-art methods through experiments on a variety of benchmark datasets. This indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation in the **Experiments** section. They mention:

1. **Animal with Attributes (AwA)**: This dataset is referenced as having 40 classes and 24,295 training images, with 6,180 testing images.
2. **Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 (CUB-200)**: This dataset has 150 classes with 8,855 training images and 2,933 testing images.
3. **SUN attribute (SUN)**: This dataset consists of 707 classes, with 14,140 training images and 200 testing images.
4. **ImageNet**: The authors use 1,000 classes from ILSVRC2012 as seen classes and 360 non-overlapping classes from ILSVRC2010 as unseen classes.

I will then confirm the details of these datasets by checking the **table** provided in the experiments section, which summarizes the statistics of the datasets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

- For **Animal with Attributes (AwA)**, the citation is:
  > Lampert, C. H., Nickisch, H., & Harmeling, S. (2014). Attribute-based classification for zero-shot visual object categorization. *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*, 36(3), 453-465.

- For **Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 (CUB-200)**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset.

- For **SUN attribute (SUN)**, the citation is:
  > Patterson, G., & Hays, J. (2012). Sun attribute database: Discovering, annotating, and recognizing scene attributes. In *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition* (CVPR), 2751-2758.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., et al. (2015). ImageNet large scale visual recognition challenge. *International Journal of Computer Vision*, 115(3), 211-252.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
