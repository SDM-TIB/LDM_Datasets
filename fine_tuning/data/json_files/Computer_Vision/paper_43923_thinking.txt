To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalized Zero and Few-Shot Transfer for Facial Forgery Detection" by Shivangi Aneja and Matthias Nießner, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of detecting facial forgeries and may reference specific datasets that have been used in previous work or that they are using in their experiments. This section often provides context for the datasets and their relevance to the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. This section is crucial as it will likely contain the names, characteristics, and purposes of the datasets.

The paper mentions several datasets:
1. **FaceForensics++ (FF++)**: A large dataset with over 1000 videos manipulated by various forgery methods. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Andreas Rössler, Davide Cozzolino, Luisa Verdoliva, Christian Riess, Justus Thies, and Matthias Nießner. *Faceforensics++: Learning to detect manipulated facial images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019.

2. **Google DeepFake Detection (Google DFD)**: This dataset consists of 3000 deepfake videos featuring 28 unique actors. The citation is:
   > Nicholas Dufour, Andrew Gully, Per Karlsson, Alexey Victor Vorbyov, Thomas Leung, Jeremiah Childs, and Christoph Bregler. *Deepfakes detection dataset by google & jigsaw*. 2019.

3. **Celeb DF (v2)**: A challenging dataset of real and synthesized deepfake videos of celebrities. The citation is:
   > Yuezun Li, Xin Yang, and Siwei Lyu. *Celeb-df: A large-scale challenging dataset for deepfake forensics*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

4. **Dessa In-the-Wild**: This dataset consists of real and fake videos of celebrities and politicians. The citation is:
   > Rayhane Mama and Sam Shi. *Dessa deepfake detection*. 2019.

5. **AIF In-the-Wild**: A new dataset introduced by the authors, consisting of unpaired real and deepfake videos. The citation is:
   > AI Foundation. *AI Foundation*. 2017.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their characteristics, such as the number of videos, types of manipulations, and any specific details mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries along with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited for future reference or downstream processing.
