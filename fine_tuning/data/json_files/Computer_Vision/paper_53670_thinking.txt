To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evidence for Hypodescent in Visual Semantic AI" by Robert Wolfe, Mahzarin R. Banaji, and Aylin Caliskan, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets used in the experiments. The introduction will likely elaborate on the context and significance of these datasets.

In the **methods section**, I will look for specific subsections that detail the datasets used in the experiments. The paper mentions the **Chicago Face Database (CFD)**, which is a dataset of images used for studies of race in psychology. This dataset is described in detail, including its composition and the specific images used for the experiments.

Next, I will check the **results section** to see if any additional datasets are referenced or if the authors discuss the datasets in the context of their findings. This section may provide insights into how the datasets were utilized and their relevance to the study's conclusions.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. For the **Chicago Face Database**, the citation is:
> Ma, D. S., Correll, J., & Wittenbrink, B. (2015). The Chicago face database: A free stimulus set of faces and norming data. *Behavior Research Methods*, 47(4), 1122-1135.

I will also look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper, such as the **FairFace dataset**, which is referenced in the context of CLIP's performance. The citation for the FairFace dataset is:
> Karkkainen, K., & Joo, J. (2021). FairFace: Face Attribute Dataset for Balanced Race, Gender, and Age for Bias Measurement and Mitigation. In *Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision* (pp. 1548-1558).

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described clearly and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
