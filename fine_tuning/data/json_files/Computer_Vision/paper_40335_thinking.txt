To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IMAGENET-TRAINED DEEP NEURAL NETWORK EXHIBITS ILLUSION-LIKE RESPONSE TO THE SCINTILLATING GRID" by Eric Sun and Ron Dekel, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on the VGG-19 DNN's response to the Scintillating Grid illusion, but it does not explicitly mention datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly the subsection titled **"Image Stimuli Sets"**. Here, the authors describe the specific sets of images used in their experiments. They mention using three distinct sets:

1. **Illusion Images**: A set of 30 illusion images, which includes various Scintillating Grid variants.
2. **Control Images**: A set of 19 natural and synthetic images, which includes animals, humans, and plants.
3. **Illusion Control Images**: A set of 11 images where no illusory perception was present for human observers.

The authors also note that representative images from each of these sets are available in the supplementary material and that the full stimuli set is included in a public repository on GitHub.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. However, it appears that the datasets themselves (i.e., the specific images used) do not have formal citations like traditional datasets. Instead, the authors provide a link to their GitHub repository, which serves as the source for the datasets used in the study.

The relevant citation for the dataset source is:
> Sun, E., & Dekel, R. (2023). *IMAGENET-TRAINED DEEP NEURAL NETWORK EXHIBITS ILLUSION-LIKE RESPONSE TO THE SCINTILLATING GRID*. Retrieved from https://github.com/sunericd/dnn-illusion

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset source as required.

In summary, I have identified the datasets used in the study and their source, which will be documented accordingly.
