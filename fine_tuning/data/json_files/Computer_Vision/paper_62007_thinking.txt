To extract datasets from the research paper titled "User-defined Event Sampling and Uncertainty Quantification in Diffusion Models for Physical Dynamical Systems" by Marc Finzi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **Results and Experiments sections** where the authors typically discuss the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention three classical dynamical systems for which they generate datasets: the **Lorenz attractor**, the **FitzHugh-Nagumo model**, and the **double pendulum**. I will look for specific details about how these datasets were constructed, including the number of trajectories, time steps, and any preprocessing steps mentioned.

In the **Dataset Construction section**, the authors provide detailed information about how they generated the datasets:

1. **Lorenz Attractor**: The authors describe generating trajectories from the Lorenz dynamics, specifying the equations used and the rescaling of the dynamics for stability. They mention generating 4000 trajectories discretized to 60 timesteps.

2. **FitzHugh-Nagumo Model**: The authors follow a specific parameter choice to produce rare events, generating initial conditions and integrating for a specified time. They also mention the number of trajectories generated.

3. **Double Pendulum**: The authors describe using Hamiltonian dynamics to generate trajectories, specifying the integration time and the sampling of initial conditions.

After identifying these datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the original works related to these models, if applicable. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Lorenz Attractor**, the original work is:
  > Lorenz, E. N. (1963). Deterministic nonperiodic flow. *Journal of Atmospheric Sciences*, 20(2), 130-141.

- For the **FitzHugh-Nagumo Model**, the citation is:
  > FitzHugh, R. (1961). Impulses and physiological states in theoretical models of nerve membrane. *Biophysical Journal*, 1(6), 445-466.

- For the **Double Pendulum**, the reference is:
  > Finzi, M., Wang, K. A., & Wilson, A. G. (2020). Simplifying Hamiltonian and Lagrangian neural networks via explicit constraints. *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*, 33, 13880-13889.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their descriptions and full citations, into a structured format for further processing or review.
