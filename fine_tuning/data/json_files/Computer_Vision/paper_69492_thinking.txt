To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BioNeRF: Biologically Plausible Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis" by Leandro A. Passos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on two datasets: "real-world images and synthetic data." This suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Methodology)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Realistic Synthetic 360° Dataset**: Also referred to as Blender or NeRF Synthetic, this dataset consists of eight object scenes with complex geometry and realistic materials, rendered from various viewpoints at a resolution of 800 × 800 pixels.

2. **Local Light Field Fusion (LLFF) Dataset**: This dataset includes 8 scenes from the LLFF Real dataset, which comprises 24 scenes captured with handheld cellphones, each containing 20-30 images.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Realistic Synthetic 360° Dataset**, the citation is:
  > B. Mildenhall, P. P. Srinivasan, M. Tancik, J. T. Barron, R. Ramamoorthi, R. Ng. *NeRF: Representing scenes as neural radiance fields for view synthesis*. Communications of the ACM 65 (1) (2021) 99–106.

- For the **LLFF Dataset**, the citation is:
  > B. Mildenhall, P. P. Srinivasan, R. Ortiz-Cayon, N. K. Kalantari, R. Ramamoorthi, R. Ng. *Local light field fusion: Practical view synthesis with prescriptive sampling guidelines*. ACM Transactions on Graphics 38 (4) (2019) 1–14.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
