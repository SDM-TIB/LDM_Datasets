To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Avoiding Latent Variable Collapse with Generative Skip Models" by Adji B. Dieng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and empirical study sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions studying images (MNIST and Omniglot) and text (Yahoo), which indicates that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **Empirical Study section (Section 4)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they assess skip-vaes using benchmark datasets for images and text: **MNIST**, **Omniglot**, and the **Yahoo Answers dataset**. This confirms that these datasets are integral to their research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition. The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

2. **Omniglot Dataset**: The Omniglot dataset is used for character recognition and is often referred to in the context of few-shot learning. The citation for the Omniglot dataset is:
   > Brenden Lake, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, and Joshua B. Tenenbaum. *Human-level concept learning through probabilistic program induction*. Science, 350(6266):1332-1338, 2015.

3. **Yahoo Answers Dataset**: The Yahoo Answers dataset is used for text modeling and is referenced in the context of deep generative models. The citation for the Yahoo Answers dataset is:
   > Z. Yang, Z. Hu, R. Salakhutdinov, and T. Berg-Kirkpatrick. *Improved variational autoencoders for text modeling using dilated convolutions*. In Proceedings of International Conference on Machine Learning, 2017.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations as required.
