To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning a Diffusion Model Policy from Rewards via Q-Score Matching" by Michael Psenka et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and related work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their experiments, including any specific details about the datasets, such as their size, type, and purpose.

In this paper, I will pay close attention to any references to datasets used in the experiments, particularly in sections that discuss the methodology or results. If the authors mention using standard datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "DeepMind Control Suite," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If the dataset is not a standard one, I will ensure to document the details provided in the paper itself.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as they appear in the references. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and proper citation.
