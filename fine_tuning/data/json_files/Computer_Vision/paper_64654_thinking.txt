To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deciphering Spatio-Temporal Graph Forecasting: A Causal Lens and Treatment" by Yutong Xia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **three real-world datasets**, which indicates that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention:

1. **PEMS08 Dataset**: This dataset contains traffic flow data collected from sensors in San Bernardino, California, during July and August 2016. It includes 170 detectors on 8 roads with a time interval of 5 minutes.

2. **AIR-BJ Dataset**: This dataset consists of one-year PM2.5 readings collected from air quality monitoring stations in Beijing, China, covering the period from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019.

3. **AIR-GZ Dataset**: Similar to the AIR-BJ dataset, this dataset contains one-year PM2.5 readings from air quality monitoring stations in Guangzhou, China, also covering the same time period as AIR-BJ.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **PEMS08 Dataset**:
  > Chao Song, Youfang Lin, Shengnan Guo, and Huaiyu Wan. *Spatial-Temporal Synchronous Graph Convolutional Networks: A New Framework for Spatial-Temporal Network Data Forecasting*. AAAI, 2020.

- For **AIR-BJ Dataset** and **AIR-GZ Dataset**:
  > Xiuwen Yi, Junbo Zhang, Zhaoyuan Wang, Tianrui Li, and Yu Zheng. *Deep Distributed Fusion Network for Air Quality Prediction*. In Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining, 2018.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
