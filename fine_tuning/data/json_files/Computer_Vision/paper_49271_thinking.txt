To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Embedding Signals on Graphs with Unbalanced Diffusion Earth Mover’s Distance" by Alexander Tong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed method to various datasets, which suggests that there are specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any explicit mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the context of the research and may provide insights into the datasets used for validation or experimentation.

I will then look into the **results** section, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. The results section mentions specific applications of the proposed method, including:

1. **Single-cell RNA-sequencing data**: The authors mention using data from 206 cells from the K562 human lymphoblast cell line, which is a known dataset in the field of single-cell genomics.

2. **Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)**: The authors refer to a dataset of 4,360 PBMCs measured via single-cell RNA-seq, which is another well-known dataset in single-cell analysis.

3. **SNOMED-CT knowledge graph**: The paper discusses the use of the SNOMED-CT dataset, which is a widely used collection of medical concepts and terms.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. 

For the **K562 human lymphoblast cell line**, the citation is:
> Longqi Liu et al. *Deconvolution of single-cell multi-omics layers reveals regulatory heterogeneity*. Nature Communications, vol. 10, no. 1, pp. 470, 2019.

For the **PBMC dataset**, the citation is:
> The 10X Genomics platform provides publicly available single-cell RNA-seq data.

For the **SNOMED-CT knowledge graph**, the citation is:
> Stefan Schulz and Gunnar O. Klein. *SNOMED CT – advances in concept mapping, retrieval, and ontological foundations*. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making, vol. 8, no. 1, pp. S1, 2008.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
