To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Orientation-Aware Leg Movement Learning for Action-Driven Human Motion Prediction" by Chunzhi Gu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on three benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges of action-driven human motion prediction and mention the datasets they will use. They specifically reference three datasets: **BABEL**, **HumanAct12**, and **NTU RGB-D**. I will take note of these names as they are crucial for the dataset extraction.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide more details about each dataset. Here’s what I find:

1. **BABEL Dataset**: The authors describe it as a large-scale human motion dataset comprising nearly 40 hours of recording with frame-wise textual annotation for action. They mention that they down-sample all sequences to 30 fps and remove overly short sequences.

2. **HumanAct12 Dataset**: This dataset is adapted from PHSPD and contains 12 categories of actions with per-sequence annotation. The authors note that they remove sequences with fewer than 35 frames.

3. **NTU RGB-D Dataset**: This dataset contains over 100,000 motions with 120 classes, and the authors mention that it has pose annotations from MS Kinect, which can be noisy and inaccurate.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **BABEL**, the citation is:
  > A. R. Punnakkal, A. Chandrasekaran, N. Athanasiou, A. Quiros-Ramirez, and M. J. Black. *BABEL: Bodies, action and behavior with English labels*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 722–731, 2021.

- For **HumanAct12**, the citation is:
  > C. Gu, J. Yu, and C. Zhang. *Learning disentangled representations for controllable human motion prediction*. Pattern Recognition, page 109998, 2024.

- For **NTU RGB-D**, the citation is:
  > J. Liu, A. Shahroudy, M. Perez, G. Wang, L.-Y. Duan, and A. C. Kot. *NTU RGB+D 120: A large-scale benchmark for 3D human activity analysis*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 42(10):2684–2701, 2019.

With this information gathered, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
