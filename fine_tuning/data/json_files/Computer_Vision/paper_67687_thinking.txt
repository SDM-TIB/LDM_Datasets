To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Encoder-Minimal and Decoder-Minimal Framework for Remote Sensing Image Dehazing" by Yuanbo Wen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or described. The abstract provides an overview of the research but may not specify datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and experiments sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges posed by haze in remote sensing images but do not mention specific datasets. I will then proceed to the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation.

In **section 3.1 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **StateHaze1K Dataset**: This dataset consists of three subsets: StateHaze1K-thin, StateHaze1K-moderate, and StateHaze1K-thick. Each subset contains 400 image pairs, with 320 for training, 35 for validation, and 45 for testing.

2. **RS-Haze Dataset**: This is a large-scale dataset containing 51,300 paired images for training and 2,700 paired images for testing.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **StateHaze1K Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Binghui Huang, Li Zhi, Chao Yang, Fuchun Sun, and Yixu Song. *Single satellite optical imagery dehazing using SAR image prior based on conditional generative adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision, pages 1806–1813, 2020.

- For the **RS-Haze Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yuda Song, Zhuqing He, Hui Qian, and Xin Du. *Vision transformers for single image dehazing*. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, vol. 32, pp. 1927–1941, 2023.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details are captured accurately and comprehensively.
