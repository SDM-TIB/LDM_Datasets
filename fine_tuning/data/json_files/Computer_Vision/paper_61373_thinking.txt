To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UDPM: Upsampling Diffusion Probabilistic Models" by Shady Abu-Hussein and Raja Giryes, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their model's capabilities on several datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, the authors explicitly mention four datasets:

1. **FFHQ**: The paper states that the model was tested on the FFHQ dataset, which contains 50,000 images of human faces.

2. **AFHQv2**: This dataset is mentioned as containing 14,000 images of animals, specifically designed for unconditional image generation.

3. **LSUN Horses**: The authors refer to the LSUN Horses dataset, which consists of 2 million images of horses.

4. **ImageNet**: The paper discusses using the ImageNet dataset, which contains 1.3 million images across 1,000 different classes for conditional generation tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **FFHQ**:
  > Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. *A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 4401–4410, 2019.

- For **AFHQv2**:
  > Yunjey Choi, Youngjung Uh, Jaejun Yoo, and Jung-Woo Ha. *Stargan v2: Diverse image synthesis for multiple domains*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 8188–8197, 2020.

- For **LSUN Horses**:
  > Fisher Yu, Ari Seff, Yinda Zhang, Shuran Song, Thomas Funkhouser, and Jianxiong Xiao. *LSUN: Construction of a large-scale image dataset using deep learning with humans in the loop*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.03365, 2015.

- For **ImageNet**:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *Imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211–252, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
