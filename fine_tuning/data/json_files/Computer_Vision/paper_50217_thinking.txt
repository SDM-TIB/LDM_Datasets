To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HighlightMe: Detecting Highlights from Human-Centric Videos" by Uttaran Bhattacharya et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention training their network on the **AVA-Kinetics action dataset** and evaluating it on four benchmark video highlight datasets: **DSH, TVSum, PHD2, and SumMe**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for understanding the research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, particularly focusing on the **5.1 Datasets** subsection. Here, the authors provide specific details about each dataset used in their experiments:

1. **AVA-Kinetics Dataset**: This dataset consists of 235 training videos and 64 validation videos, each 15 minutes long, annotated with action labels in 1-second clips. It is used for training the highlight detection network.

2. **DSH Dataset**: The Domain-Specific Highlights (DSH) dataset consists of YouTube videos across six domain-specific categories: dog show, gymnastics, parkour, skating, skiing, and surfing. There are roughly 100 videos in each domain, totaling around 1,430 minutes.

3. **PHD2 Dataset**: The Personal Highlight Detection dataset (PHD2) contains around 10,000 YouTube videos, totaling about 55,800 minutes, with highlights annotated by 850 users based on their preferences.

4. **TVSum Dataset**: The TVSum dataset includes 50 YouTube videos totaling about 210 minutes, collected across ten domains, including beekeeping, bike tricks, dog shows, and more.

5. **SumMe Dataset**: The SumMe dataset consists of 25 personal videos, totaling about 66 minutes.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **AVA-Kinetics Dataset**, the citation is:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
