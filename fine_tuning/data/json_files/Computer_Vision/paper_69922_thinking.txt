To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Addressing Order Sensitivity of In-Context Demonstration Examples in Causal Language Models" by Yanzheng Xiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, while the introduction often outlines the datasets used for experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on four benchmarks. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly list the datasets in **section 4.1 (Datasets)**. Here, they mention the following datasets:

1. **SST-5 Dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis and contains 5 classes. The authors note that it has 8.5k training samples, 1.1k validation samples, and 2.2k test samples.

2. **SST-2 Dataset**: Another sentiment analysis dataset, but with only 2 classes. It has 67.3k training samples, 0.9k validation samples, and 1.8k test samples.

3. **RTE Dataset**: This dataset is used for recognizing textual entailment and has 2 classes. It consists of 2.5k training samples, 0.3k validation samples, and 0.3k test samples.

4. **QNLI Dataset**: This dataset is a question-answering dataset derived from the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) and has 2 classes. It includes 105.0k training samples, 5.5k validation samples, and 5.5k test samples.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **SST-5 Dataset**:

- For **SST-2 Dataset**:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
