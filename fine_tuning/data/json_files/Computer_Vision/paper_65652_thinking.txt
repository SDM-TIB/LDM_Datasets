To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Non-Linear MRI Inversion with Diffusion Priors" by Moritz Erlacher and Martin Zach, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of DICOM data for training, which suggests that this dataset is important for the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention using the **fastMRI dataset** for training and testing their model. This is a significant dataset in the context of MRI reconstruction.

In the **experiments section**, the authors specify that they used the RSS reconstructions of size 320 Ã— 320 from the fastMRI dataset, focusing on both proton density (PD) and proton density fat-suppressed (PDFS) contrasts. This indicates that the dataset is not only referenced but also utilized in a specific manner for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the fastMRI dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For the **fastMRI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jure Zbontar, Florian Knoll, Anuroop Sriram, Tullie Murrell, Zhengnan Huang, Matthew J Muckley, Aaron Defazio, Ruben Stern, Patricia Johnson, Mary Bruno, et al. *fastMRI: An open dataset and benchmarks for accelerated MRI*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.08839, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **fastMRI dataset**: This dataset is used for training and testing the proposed model, consisting of MRI images with both PD and PDFS contrasts.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the full citations as required.
