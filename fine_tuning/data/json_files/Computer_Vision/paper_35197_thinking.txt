To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Propagating Confidences through CNNs for Sparse Data Regression" by Abdelrahman Eldesokey et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that comprehensive experiments are performed on the **KITTI depth benchmark**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors describe the **KITTI depth benchmark** in detail, stating that it consists of projected LiDAR point clouds and has a total of 86,000 training images, 7,000 validation images, and 1,000 test server images. This section confirms that the KITTI dataset is indeed the primary dataset used for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the KITTI depth benchmark. The citation provided in the paper is:

> Jonas Uhrig, Nick Schneider, Lukas Schneider, Uwe Franke, Thomas Brox, and Andreas Geiger. *Sparsity Invariant CNNs*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06500.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **KITTI Depth Benchmark**: This dataset is used for scene depth completion tasks and includes projected LiDAR point clouds. It contains 86,000 training images, 7,000 validation images, and 1,000 test images.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the KITTI depth benchmark, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the relevant dataset information from the research paper.
