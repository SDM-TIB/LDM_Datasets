To extract datasets from the research paper titled "New trends in indoor positioning based on WiFi and machine learning: A systematic review" by Vladimir Bellavista-Parent et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions a systematic review of works that use WiFi for indoor positioning, which suggests that various datasets might be referenced throughout the paper. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or specific studies that utilized datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, particularly **Table I**, which summarizes the articles reviewed. This table includes information about various datasets used in the studies, such as the UJIIndoorLoc dataset, which is noted as the most commonly used public signal map. I will extract the names of datasets mentioned in this table and any relevant details provided.

In addition, I will check the **discussion section** for any further insights into the datasets used in the studies reviewed. The authors may discuss the significance of certain datasets or provide additional context that could be useful for understanding their application in the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. For example, the UJIIndoorLoc dataset is referenced in the context of multiple studies, and I will need to locate its original citation to ensure proper attribution.

The UJIIndoorLoc dataset citation is:
> Joaquín Torres-Sospedra et al. "UJIIndoorLoc: A new multi-building and multi-floor database for WLAN fingerprint-based indoor localization problems." In: 2014 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN), pages 261–270.

I will also look for citations for any other datasets mentioned in the paper, such as IPIN2016, UTSIndoorLoc, JUIndoorLoc, and others, ensuring that I capture their full citations as well.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets discussed in the paper, along with their proper citations for academic integrity.
