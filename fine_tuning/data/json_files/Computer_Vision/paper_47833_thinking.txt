To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VR3Dense: Voxel Representation Learning for 3D Object Detection and Monocular Dense Depth Reconstruction" by Shubham Shrivastava, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a LiDAR point-cloud and a single RGB image, which suggests that datasets related to these modalities might be involved. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of 3D object detection and monocular depth estimation, hinting at the datasets used for training and evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors specifically mention using the **KITTI 3D object detection dataset** for training and testing their method. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including the number of training and testing samples.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe how they split the KITTI dataset into training and validation sets, which provides additional context about how the dataset is utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the KITTI dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For the **KITTI 3D object detection dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2012.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details as follows:

1. **KITTI 3D Object Detection Dataset**: This dataset contains 7481 training samples and 7518 testing samples. It is widely used for evaluating 3D object detection algorithms in autonomous driving scenarios.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary information is clearly presented for future reference or processing.
