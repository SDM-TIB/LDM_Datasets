To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Counterfactual Visual Explanations" by Guillaume Jeanneret et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimentation sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "extensive experimentation" and "multiple testbeds," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Evaluation Protocols and Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **CelebA**: A dataset containing images of celebrities, used for evaluating attributes like 'smile' and 'age'. The authors specify that the images are of size 128 × 128.

2. **CelebA HQ**: A higher-resolution version of CelebA, with images of size 256 × 256, also used for the same attributes.

3. **BDD100k**: A dataset containing complex traffic scenes, used for evaluating the 'forward' vs 'slow down' attributes. The images are of size 512 × 256.

4. **BDD-IOA**: An extension of the BDD100k dataset, used for additional evaluations.

In the **experimentation section**, the authors confirm that they used these datasets for their evaluations, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), December 2015.

- For **CelebA HQ**, the citation is:
  > Cheng-Han Lee, Ziwei Liu, Lingyun Wu, and Ping Luo. *Maskgan: Towards diverse and interactive facial image manipulation*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

- For **BDD100k**, the citation is:
  > Fisher Yu, Haofeng Chen, Xin Wang, Wenqi Xian, Yingying Chen, Fangchen Liu, Vashisht Madhavan, and Trevor Darrell. *BDD100k: A diverse driving dataset for heterogeneous multitask learning*. In 2020 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2633–2642, 2020.

- For **BDD-IOA**, the citation is:
  > Yiran Xu, Xiaoyin Yang, Lihang Gong, Hsuan-Chu Lin, Tz-Ying Wu, Yunsheng Li, and Nuno Vasconcelos. *Explainable object-induced action decision for autonomous vehicles*. 2020 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 9520–9529, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for clarity and proper attribution.
