To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accelerating Atmospheric Turbulence Simulation via Learned Phase-to-Space Transform" by Zhiyuan Mao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for a simulator to generate large-scale datasets for training and testing deep learning models, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors mention the challenge of synthesizing large-scale datasets at a low computational cost. This indicates that they may have developed or utilized specific datasets for their experiments.

In the **experimental evaluation section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used in their experiments. The authors refer to the **NATO RTG-40 dataset** and datasets used in other studies, which are crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

I will then check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The relevant datasets identified are:

1. **NATO RTG-40 dataset**: This dataset contains optical and estimated turbulence parameters used for evaluating the proposed simulation technique. The citation is:
   > Endre Repasi and Robert Weiss. *Analysis of image distortions by atmospheric turbulence and computer simulation of turbulence effects*. Proc SPIE, 6941, 05 2008.

2. **Datasets used in [12] and [1]**: These datasets are mentioned as being used for visual comparisons in the paper. The citations for these datasets are:
   > Nantheera Anantrasirichai, Alin Achim, Nick G. Kingsbury, and David R. Bull. *Atmospheric turbulence mitigation using complex wavelet-based fusion*. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 22(6):2398–2408, June 2013.
   > Michael Hirsch, Suvrit Sra, Bernhard Schölkopf, and Stefan Harmeling. *Efficient filter flow for space-variant multiframe blind deconvolution*. In The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 607–614, June 2010.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
