To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Mask-aware CLIP Representations for Zero-Shot Segmentation" by Siyu Jiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on popular zero-shot benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors mention evaluating their method on three commonly used zero-shot segmentation benchmarks: **COCO-Stuff**, **Pascal-VOC**, and **ADE20K**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are relevant to their research.

I will then look into the **methodology** and **experiments** sections to gather more details about how these datasets were used. The authors describe the datasets in the context of their experiments, confirming that they utilized:

1. **COCO-Stuff**: A large-scale semantic segmentation dataset that includes 171 classes, with 156 seen classes for training and 15 unseen classes for testing.
2. **Pascal-VOC**: This dataset consists of 10,582 images for training and 1,449 images for testing, split into 15 seen classes and 5 unseen classes for the zero-shot setting.
3. **ADE20K**: This dataset contains 25,000 images for training and 2,000 images for validation, with a specific focus on 847 classes for the zero-shot setting.

In the **results** section, the authors provide performance metrics for their method on these datasets, further confirming their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references** section to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **COCO-Stuff**, the citation is:
  > Holger Caesar, Jasper Uijlings, and Vittorio Ferrari. *Coco-stuff: Thing and stuff classes in context*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 1209–1218, 2018.

- For **Pascal-VOC**, the citation is:
  > Mark Everingham, SM Ali Eslami, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The pascal visual object classes challenge: A retrospective*. International journal of computer vision, 111:98–136, 2015.

- For **ADE20K**, the citation is:
  > Bolei Zhou, Hang Zhao, Xavier Puig, Sanja Fidler, Adela Barriuso, and Antonio Torralba. *Scene parsing through ade20k dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 633–641, 2017.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
