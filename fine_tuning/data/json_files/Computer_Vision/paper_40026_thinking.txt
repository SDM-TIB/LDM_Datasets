To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Representation Learning for Words and Entities" by Pushpendre Rastogi, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

1. **Initial Reading**: I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the contributions and may mention datasets used for evaluation.

2. **Identifying Sections**: I will pay particular attention to sections that typically discuss datasets, such as **"Data," "Experiments," or "Results."** These sections usually contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments.

3. **Extracting Dataset Information**: As I read through these sections, I will note down the names of the datasets, their characteristics (such as size, type, and purpose), and any relevant details provided by the authors. For example, if the authors mention a dataset used for training or evaluation, I will capture that information.

4. **Full Citations**: After identifying the datasets, I will look for the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This may involve looking for specific papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail. If the datasets are well-known, I will ensure to include their original sources.

5. **Compiling the Information**: I will compile the information into a structured format, detailing each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

6. **Verification**: Finally, I will cross-check the extracted information against the text to ensure accuracy and completeness, making sure that all relevant datasets are included and correctly cited.

By following these steps, I will be able to effectively extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, ensuring that I provide full citations for each dataset as required.
