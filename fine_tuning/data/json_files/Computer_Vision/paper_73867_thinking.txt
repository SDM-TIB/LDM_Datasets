To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DEFT: Efficient Finetuning of Conditional Diffusion Models by Learning the Generalised h-transform" by Alexander Denker et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. In this section, the authors describe their evaluation on various tasks, and I will look for specific dataset names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In the paper, the authors mention using the **ImageNet dataset** for image reconstruction tasks and the **LoDoPab-CT dataset** for computed tomography evaluations. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, such as their sizes and any specific subsets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For the **ImageNet dataset**, the citation is:
> Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *Imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge*. IJCV, 115:211–252, 2015.

For the **LoDoPab-CT dataset**, the citation is:
> Johannes Leuschner, Maximilian Schmidt, Daniel Otero Baguer, and Peter Maass. *Lodopab-ct, a benchmark dataset for low-dose computed tomography reconstruction*. Scientific Data, 8(1):109, 2021.

Now that I have the dataset names and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **ImageNet Dataset**: Used for image reconstruction tasks. 
   - Citation: Olga Russakovsky et al. *Imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge*. IJCV, 115:211–252, 2015.

2. **LoDoPab-CT Dataset**: Used for computed tomography evaluations.
   - Citation: Johannes Leuschner et al. *Lodopab-ct, a benchmark dataset for low-dose computed tomography reconstruction*. Scientific Data, 8(1):109, 2021.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that all dataset citations are included for proper attribution.
