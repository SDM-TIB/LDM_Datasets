To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MSCDA: Multi-level Semantic-guided Contrast Improves Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Breast MRI Segmentation in Small Datasets" by Sheng Kuang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validated their method using datasets of healthy volunteers and invasive breast cancer patients, which suggests that specific datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Dataset 1**: This dataset consists of MRI images from 11 healthy volunteers, including T1-weighted (T1W) and T2-weighted (T2W) images. The authors note that the images were collected in two separate sessions, and they provide specific acquisition parameters.

2. **Dataset 2**: This dataset includes images from 134 patients with invasive breast cancer, also containing T1W and T2W MRIs. The authors describe the imaging conditions and acquisition parameters, emphasizing the differences between the two datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For **Dataset 1**, the citation is:
> Granzier, R., Ibrahim, A., Primakov, S., Keek, S., Halilaj, I., Zwanenburg, A., Engelen, S., Lobbes, M., Lambin, P., Woodruff, H. (2022). Test–retest data for the assessment of breast MRI radiomic feature repeatability. *Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging*, 56, 592–604.

For **Dataset 2**, the citation is:
> Granzier, R., Verbakel, N., Ibrahim, A., Van Timmeren, J., Van Nijnatten, T., Leijenaar, R., Lobbes, M., Smidt, M., Woodruff, H. (2020). MRI-based radiomics in breast cancer: Feature robustness with respect to inter-observer segmentation variability. *Scientific Reports*, 10, 1–11.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its citation for proper referencing.
