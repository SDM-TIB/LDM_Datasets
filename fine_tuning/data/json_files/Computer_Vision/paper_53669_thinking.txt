To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RVAE-LAMOL: Residual Variational Autoencoder to Enhance Lifelong Language Learning" by Han Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors tested their method on permutations of three datasets from DecaNLP, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the **experiments setup** section, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **English Wizard of Oz (WOZ)**: This dataset is described as a dialogue dataset focused on restaurant reservations.
2. **QA-SRL**: This dataset is for semantic role labeling in a question-answering format.
3. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**: This dataset is a binary sentiment analysis dataset.

I will also check the **tables** and **figures** for any additional details about the datasets, such as sizes and evaluation metrics. In **Table I**, the paper provides the number of training and testing samples for each dataset, which is useful for understanding their scale.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are as follows:

- For **WOZ**, the citation is:
  > Wen, T., Vandyke, D., Mrksic, N., Gasic, M., Rojas-Barahona, L. M., Su, P., Ultes, S., & Young, S. J. (2017). *A network-based end-to-end trainable task-oriented dialogue system*. In Proceedings of the 15th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (EACL 2017), Valencia, Spain, April 3-7, 2017, Volume 1: Long Papers, pp. 438–449.

- For **QA-SRL**, the citation is:
  > He, L., Lee, K., Lewis, M., & Zettlemoyer, L. (2017). *Deep semantic role labeling: What works and what’s next*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2017), pp. 473–483.

- For **SST**, the citation is:
  > Radford, A., Jozefowicz, R., & Sutskever, I. (2017). *Learning to generate reviews and discovering sentiment*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.01444.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately with its corresponding citation. This structured approach will help in organizing the datasets for further analysis or processing.
