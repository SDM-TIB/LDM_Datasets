To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Monocular Real-Time Volumetric Performance Capture" by Ruilong Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used for training and evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of "high-quality photogrammetry scans of clothed humans" and refer to the "RenderPeople" dataset. This indicates that there are specific datasets utilized in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors explicitly describe two datasets:

1. **RenderPeople Dataset**: This dataset consists of high-quality photogrammetry scans of clothed humans, which includes 466 static scans and additional rigged models. The authors mention that they used this dataset to create a training set with a total of 16,498 models.

2. **BUFF Dataset**: The authors use the BUFF dataset for quantitative evaluation. This dataset contains high-fidelity geometry with photorealistic textures and includes 26 sequences with per-frame ground-truth 3D meshes and textures.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **RenderPeople Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Renderpeople. *3D People*. Available at: https://renderpeople.com/3d-people.

- For the **BUFF Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, C., Pujades, S., Black, M.J., Pons-Moll, G. *Detailed, accurate, human shape estimation from clothed 3D scan sequences*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 4191â€“4200, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
