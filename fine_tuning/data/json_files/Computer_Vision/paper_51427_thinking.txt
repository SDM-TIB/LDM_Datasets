To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "AFDetV2: Rethinking the Necessity of the Second Stage for Object Detection from Point Clouds" by Yihan Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that they conducted experiments on the **Waymo Open Dataset** and the **nuScenes Dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are relevant to their research.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors provide specific information about the datasets:

1. **nuScenes Dataset**: This dataset contains 700 training sequences, 150 validation sequences, and 150 test sequences, with annotations for 10 classes. The nuScenes detection score (NDS) is the main ranking metric for this dataset.

2. **Waymo Open Dataset**: This dataset consists of 798 training sequences, 202 validation sequences, and 150 test sequences for detecting VEHICLE, PEDESTRIAN, and CYCLIST classes. The dataset includes boxes classified as LEVEL 1 (L1) and LEVEL 2 (L2) based on the number of LiDAR points.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **nuScenes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Caesar, H., Bankiti, V., Lang, A. H., Vora, S., Liong, V. E., Xu, Q., Krishnan, A., Pan, Y., Baldan, G., and Beijbom, O. (2020). *nuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For the **Waymo Open Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sun, P., Kretzschmar, H., Dotiwalla, X., Chouard, A., Patnaik, V., Tsui, P., Guo, J., Zhou, Y., Chai, Y., Caine, B., et al. (2020). *Scalability in Perception for Autonomous Driving: Waymo Open Dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the specified requirements for further processing or review.
