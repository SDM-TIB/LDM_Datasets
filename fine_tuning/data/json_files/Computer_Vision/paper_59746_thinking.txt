To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Anti-DreamBooth: Protecting users from personalized text-to-image synthesis" by Thanh Van Le et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their methods on two facial datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically section 5, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using two facial benchmarks: **CelebA-HQ** and **VGGFace2**. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In section 5.1, the authors specify the criteria for selecting the datasets, confirming that both datasets meet the requirements for their study. They provide descriptions of each dataset:

1. **CelebA-HQ**: A high-quality version of the CelebA dataset, consisting of 30,000 images at a resolution of 1024 × 1024, filtered to include 307 subjects with at least 15 images each.

2. **VGGFace2**: Contains approximately 3.31 million images of 9131 person identities, filtered to include subjects with at least 15 images of resolution above 500 × 500. For their experiments, they selected 50 identities.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

- For **CelebA-HQ**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), December 2015.

- For **VGGFace2**, the citation is:
  > Cao, Q., Shen, L., Xie, W., Parkhi, O. M., & Zisserman, A. (2018). *VGGFace2: A dataset for recognising faces across pose and age*. In International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or citations while extracting the datasets from the paper.
