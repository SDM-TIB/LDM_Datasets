To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Blind Dates: Examining the Expression of Temporality in Historical Photographs" by Alexandra Barancová et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to see if any datasets are introduced or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the **De Boer Scene Detection dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant sections that discuss the methodology or experiments. In this case, the paper describes the **De Boer Scene Detection dataset** in detail within the **Image Dating** section. The authors specify that this dataset contains **39,866 gray-scale historical press photographs** from **1950 to 1999**, which is crucial information for my extraction.

I will also check the **conclusion** and **discussion** sections to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors refer to other datasets in their findings. However, the primary focus remains on the **De Boer Scene Detection dataset**.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the **De Boer Scene Detection dataset**. The paper states that the dataset is available at a specific URL, which is important for proper citation. The citation format should include the authors, title, publication details, and the URL.

The full citation for the **De Boer Scene Detection dataset** is:
> Wevers, M., Vriend, N., & de Bruin, A. (2022). What to do with 2,000,000 Historical Press Photos? The Challenges and Opportunities of Applying a Scene Detection Algorithm to a Digitised Press Photo Collection. *TMG Journal for Media History*, 25, 1–24. URL: http://www.tmgonline.nl/articles/10.18146/tmg.815/.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare to create an entry for the dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will allow for proper documentation and referencing in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
