To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A heuristic method for data allocation and task scheduling on heterogeneous multiprocessor systems under memory constraints" by Junwen Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

If the datasets are not clearly defined in the experiments section, I will check the **literature review** or **related work sections**. Authors often reference datasets used in previous studies, which may be relevant to their own work.

Once I identify the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called "Randomly Generated Instances," I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail. If the dataset is commonly used in the field, I may also find it cited in other papers.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I accurately represent the information as presented in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for any required output format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited, ready for further processing or review.
