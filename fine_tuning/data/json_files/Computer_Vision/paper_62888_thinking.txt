To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improved Label Design for Timing Synchronization in OFDM Systems against Multi-path Uncertainty" by Chaojin Qing et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses a learning-based timing synchronization method but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** to see if the authors describe any datasets used for training or testing their proposed method. In this case, the authors mention that they obtained training data sets {Qi, ti}Nt=104, which indicates that they used a specific dataset for their experiments. However, the details of this dataset are not provided in the text.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations that might refer to datasets or data generation methods. The references include various studies and papers, but I need to determine if any of these references correspond to datasets used in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite several works related to OFDM systems and timing synchronization, but they do not provide specific dataset citations. This suggests that the dataset may be generated or synthesized based on the described methods rather than being a publicly available dataset.

Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset names or citations, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Training Data Set**: The authors mention a training dataset {Qi, ti}Nt=104, but do not provide a full citation or details about its origin or how it was generated.

2. **Reference Citations**: The references include various studies related to OFDM and timing synchronization, but none specifically mention datasets.

In conclusion, while I have identified that a training dataset was used, the lack of explicit dataset names and citations in the paper means that I cannot provide full citations for datasets as required. I will note this limitation in my final output.
