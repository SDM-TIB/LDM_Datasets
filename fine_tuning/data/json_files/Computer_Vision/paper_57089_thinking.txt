To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LISA: Localized Image Stylization with Audio via Implicit Neural Representation" by Seung Hyun Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a novel framework and implies the use of datasets for training and evaluation, which suggests that datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two datasets:

1. **VGG-Sound Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing over 200,000 audio-visual pairs, which is crucial for training the audio encoder and decoder. 

2. **Greatest Hits Dataset**: This dataset includes various audios of hitting and scratching objects, totaling 733 videos. It is used in conjunction with the VGG-Sound dataset for training purposes.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **VGG-Sound Dataset**:
  > Honglie Chen, Weidi Xie, Andrea Vedaldi, and Andrew Zisserman. *VGGSound: A large-scale audio-visual dataset*. In ICASSP 2020-2020 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 721–725. IEEE, 2020.

- For **Greatest Hits Dataset**:
  > Andrew Owens, Phillip Isola, Josh McDermott, Antonio Torralba, Edward H Adelson, and William T Freeman. *Visually indicated sounds*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 2405–2413, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation for proper documentation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
