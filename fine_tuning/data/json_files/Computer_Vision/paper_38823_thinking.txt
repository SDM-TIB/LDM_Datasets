To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convolution Forgetting Curve Model for Repeated Learning" by Yanlu Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, results, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, particularly the subsections that detail the experiments conducted. In this section, the authors describe the perceptual training experiment involving Japanese learners and Mandarin tones. I will look for specific mentions of datasets or materials used in these experiments.

In the **methods section**, the authors outline the training and testing modules, which may include details about the datasets used for the experiments. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the data collected during the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors conducted experiments using Mandarin tone learning materials for Japanese learners. However, they do not explicitly name a dataset in the traditional sense, such as a publicly available dataset. Instead, they describe the training materials and the experimental setup.

To ensure I have the correct references, I will consult the **References section** to find any citations related to the training materials or previous studies that may have used similar datasets. I will also look for any specific studies that the authors reference regarding the Mandarin tones or the perceptual training methods.

Since the paper does not provide a formal dataset citation, I will summarize the relevant information about the training materials used in the experiments, including the number of words and the context of their use.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include any relevant citations from the references that pertain to the datasets or materials used in the experiments. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, even if they are not formally named datasets.

In summary, my steps will include:
1. Reading the abstract, introduction, results, and methods sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Identifying the training materials used in the experiments.
3. Consulting the references for related studies or datasets.
4. Compiling the information into a structured summary with appropriate citations.
