To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Early Dropouts of an Active and Healthy Ageing App" by Vasileios Perifanis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors processed a given database and generated **seven datasets** for their study, which is a clear indication that I need to look for detailed descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Pre-processing Methods)**, particularly the subsection **2.2 (The Issue of Duplicate Session Tuples)**, where the authors describe the datasets generated. They mention that they created **seven different versions of the dataset**, starting from Dataset 0, which contains only user acquisitions, and progressively adding features up to Dataset 6, which includes all static information.

I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Dataset 0**: Contains only the acquisitions of users.
2. **Dataset 1**: Dataset 0 + Timestamp.
3. **Dataset 2**: Dataset 1 + Demographic features.
4. **Dataset 3**: Dataset 2 + SPQ questionnaire responses.
5. **Dataset 4**: Dataset 3 + UCLA questionnaire responses.
6. **Dataset 5**: Dataset 4 + EQ5D3L questionnaire responses.
7. **Dataset 6**: Dataset 5 + UTAUT questionnaire responses.

In the **conclusion** section, the authors summarize their findings and the implications of their work, but I need to ensure I have the full citations for the datasets mentioned.

To find the full citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The authors cite the MAHA dataset in detail, which is crucial for my extraction. The citation for the MAHA dataset is:

- Fico, G., Abril-Jimenez, P., Lombroni, I., Merino-Barbancho, B., Patricio, B., Arroyo, P., Cea, G., Mejias-Izquierdo, G., Medrano, A., Cabrera-Umpierrez, M. F., Henriques, J., Carvalho, P., Mata, A., & Arredondo Waldmeyer, M. T. (2022). *The MAHA dataset: Understanding and improving adherence to digital interventions for active and healthy ageing*. Springer Singapore.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MAHA dataset, which is the primary dataset referenced in the paper.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited.
