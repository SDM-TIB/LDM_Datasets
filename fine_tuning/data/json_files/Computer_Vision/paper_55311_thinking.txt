To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Vision-Language Pretraining with Visual Concepts and Hierarchical Alignment" by Mustafa Shukor et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors pretrain their model on three public datasets: **COCO**, **Visual Genome**, and **SBU**. This is a strong indication that these datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the methodology, the authors describe their training setup and mention that they use these three datasets, which confirms their relevance to the study.

I will then check the **experiments section** for any specific details about how these datasets were used, including any relevant statistics or characteristics. The authors mention that they pretrain on COCO, Visual Genome, and SBU, with COCO being a well-known dataset for image captioning, Visual Genome providing dense annotations, and SBU being a dataset with noisy captions.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. 

1. **COCO Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., Zitnick, C.L. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 740–755.

2. **Visual Genome Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Krishna, R., Zhu, Y., Groth, O., Johnson, J., Hata, K., Kravitz, J., Chen, S., Kalantidis, Y., Li, L.J., Shamma, D.A., et al. (2017). *Visual Genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 123(1), 32–73.

3. **SBU Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Sharma, P., Ding, N., Goodman, S., Soricut, R. (2018). *Conceptual Captions: A cleaned, hypernymed, image alt-text dataset for automatic image captioning*. In ACL.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I have accurately captured all relevant details for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive dataset entry for further processing or review.
