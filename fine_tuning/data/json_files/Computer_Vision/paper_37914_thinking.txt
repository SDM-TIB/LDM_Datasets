To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Quantized Representations for Script Generation" by Noah Weber et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention utilizing the **New York Times Gigaword Corpus** as their dataset, which is a significant clue that I need to explore further.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Dataset and Preprocessing)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they used. Here, they describe the **New York Times Gigaword Corpus** in detail, noting that it contains around 1.8 million articles and specifying how they split the data into training, development, and test sets. They also explain how they preprocess the data into event sequences.

In this section, I will note the specifics of the dataset, including the number of articles used for training, development, and testing, as well as the method of extracting event tuples using the Open Information Extraction system called Ollie.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **New York Times Gigaword Corpus**. The citation typically includes the authors, title, publication details, and year. If the dataset is not cited in the references, I will look for any external references or acknowledgments that might provide the necessary citation.

After gathering all the relevant information, I will compile the dataset details, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **New York Times Gigaword Corpus** as follows:

- **New York Times Gigaword Corpus**: The authors describe it as a dataset containing approximately 1.8 million articles, which they split into training, development, and test sets. The preprocessing involves extracting event tuples and forming event sequences.

The full citation for the **New York Times Gigaword Corpus** is:
> Graff, P. (2005). *The New York Times Gigaword Corpus*. Linguistic Data Consortium.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset information in the required format, ensuring clarity and completeness for any downstream processing or review.
