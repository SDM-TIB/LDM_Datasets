To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion Video Autoencoders: Toward Temporally Consistent Face Video Editing via Disentangled Video Encoding" by Gyeongman Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of face video editing and mentions the use of a dataset for training, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors refer to the **CelebA-HQ dataset** as a source for training their model, which is a strong indication that this dataset is relevant to their work.

In the **experiments section**, particularly in section 5, the authors mention that they trained their model on **77294 videos of the VoxCeleb1 dataset**. This is a crucial piece of information as it indicates the dataset used for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

1. **CelebA-HQ Dataset**:
   > Liu, Z., Liu, M.-Y., Yang, Y., Huang, X., & Wang, Z. (2018). *CelebA-HQ: A Large-Scale Benchmark for High-Quality Face Generation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 5556–5566.

2. **VoxCeleb1 Dataset**:
   > Nagrani, A., Chung, J. S., & Zisserman, A. (2017). *VoxCeleb: A Large-Scale Speaker Identification Dataset*. In INTERSPEECH, pages 2616–2620.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
