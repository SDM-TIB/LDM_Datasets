To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bidirectional Stereo Image Compression with Cross-Dimensional Entropy Model" by Zhening Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed BiSIC method and mentions "extensive experiments" but does not specify datasets. This indicates that I need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the importance of stereo image compression and the challenges faced in the field. They do not mention specific datasets, so I will proceed to the next section.

I will then look at **section 4 (Experiments)**, which is likely to contain details about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors explicitly mention two benchmark datasets:

1. **InStereo2K**: This dataset contains 2,060 indoor scene stereo image pairs of size 1,080 × 860, split into 2,010 image pairs for training and 50 for testing.

2. **Cityscapes**: This dataset consists of 5,000 outdoor scene stereo image pairs of size 2,048 × 1,024, with 2,975 pairs allocated for training and 1,525 for testing.

Both datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper, confirming their significance.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **InStereo2K**, the citation is:
  > Bao, W., Wang, W., Xu, Y., Guo, Y., Hong, S., Zhang, X. (2020). Instereo2k: A large real dataset for stereo matching in indoor scenes. *Science China Information Sciences*, 63, 1–11.

- For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:
  > Cordts, M., Omran, M., Ramos, S., Rehfeld, T., Enzweiler, M., Benenson, R., Franke, U., Roth, S., Schiele, B. (2016). The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding. In *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition* (CVPR), pp. 3213–3223.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **InStereo2K**: A dataset with 2,060 indoor scene stereo image pairs, used for training and testing.
   - Citation: Bao, W., Wang, W., Xu, Y., Guo, Y., Hong, S., Zhang, X. (2020). Instereo2k: A large real dataset for stereo matching in indoor scenes. *Science China Information Sciences*, 63, 1–11.

2. **Cityscapes**: A dataset with 5,000 outdoor scene stereo image pairs, also used for training and testing.
   - Citation: Cordts, M., Omran, M., Ramos, S., Rehfeld, T., Enzweiler, M., Benenson, R., Franke, U., Roth, S., Schiele, B. (2016). The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding. In *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition* (CVPR), pp. 3213–3223.

With this information, I am ready to compile the dataset entries into the required format for further processing or review.
