To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-modal Data Binding for Survival Analysis Modeling with Incomplete Data and Annotations" by Linhao Qu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the proposed method demonstrates outstanding prediction accuracy in two survival analysis tasks on employed datasets. This suggests that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors describe the datasets used for their analysis. In this section, they mention two datasets:

1. **Dataset 1**: This dataset contains 367 patients, with various modalities such as radiology images, medical history reports, and colonoscopy reports. The authors provide specific counts for each modality, which indicates the dataset's complexity and the types of data included.

2. **Dataset 2**: This dataset includes 193 patients, with similar modalities as Dataset 1 but with different counts for each modality. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' structure and the context in which they were used.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. However, the datasets themselves may not have specific citations if they are in-house datasets or not publicly available. In this case, I will note that the datasets are described as "real-world in-house datasets" and do not have formal citations.

Now, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Dataset 1**: Contains 367 patients, with 180 having radiology images, 303 medical history reports, 205 colonoscopy reports, and 89 radiology reports. This dataset is used for overall survival (OS) prediction and disease-free survival (DFS) prediction.

- **Dataset 2**: Comprises 193 patients, with 133 having radiology images, 181 with medical history reports, 154 with colonoscopy reports, and 129 with radiology reports. Similar to Dataset 1, it is used for OS and DFS prediction.

Since these datasets are not publicly cited, I will note that they are in-house datasets used for the experiments in this study.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
