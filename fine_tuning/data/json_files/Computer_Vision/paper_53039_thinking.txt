To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-grained Noise Control for Multispeaker Speech Synthesis" by Karolos Nikitaras et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention the use of "publicly available corpora, such as VCTK and LibriTTS." This indicates that these datasets are significant to the research and should be noted.

Next, I will look into the **introduction** section for more details. The authors provide descriptions of both datasets: VCTK contains recordings from 109 speakers, and LibriTTS consists of recordings from about 2,500 English speakers. This confirms that both datasets are utilized in their experiments.

Moving on to the **experiments** section, I will check for any additional datasets mentioned. In this section, the authors specify that they used **Train-clean-100**, a subset of LibriTTS, for their training set. They also mention augmenting this dataset with background noise from the **CHIME 4 challenge**. This is another dataset that needs to be included.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section**:

1. **VCTK Corpus**:
   > Yamagishi, J., Veaux, C., & MacDonald, K. (2019). *CSTR VCTK Corpus: English multi-speaker corpus for CSTR voice cloning toolkit (version 0.92)*.

2. **LibriTTS**:
   > Zen, H., Dang, V., Clark, R., Zhang, Y., Weiss, R. J., Jia, Y., Chen, Z., & Wu, Y. (2019). *LibriTTS: A corpus derived from Librispeech for text-to-speech*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1904.02882.

3. **Train-clean-100** (as a subset of LibriTTS):
   > Zen, H., Dang, V., Clark, R., Zhang, Y., Weiss, R. J., Jia, Y., Chen, Z., & Wu, Y. (2019). *LibriTTS: A corpus derived from Librispeech for text-to-speech*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1904.02882. (Note: The citation for Train-clean-100 is the same as for LibriTTS since it is a subset.)

4. **CHIME 4 Challenge**:
   > Vincent, E., Watanabe, S., Nugraha, A. A., Barker, J., & Marxer, R. (2018). *An analysis of environment, microphone and data simulation mismatches in robust speech recognition*. Computer Speech & Language.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
