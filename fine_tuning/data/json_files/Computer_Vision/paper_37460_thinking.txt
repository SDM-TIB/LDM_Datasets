To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ggRandomForests: Random Forests for Regression" by John Ehrlinger, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **Boston Housing data**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 2 (Data: Boston Housing Values)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the Boston Housing dataset. They state that it contains data for 506 census tracts of Boston from the 1970 census and is available in multiple R packages, specifically noting that they will use the version from the **MASS package**.

In this section, the authors provide a brief overview of the dataset's variables, including descriptions of each variable, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Boston Housing dataset. The relevant citations are:

- For the Boston Housing dataset, the citation is:
  > Harrison, D., & Rubinfeld, D. L. (1978). Hedonic prices and the demand for clean air. *Journal of Environmental Economics and Management*, 5, 81-102.

Additionally, the authors reference other works that describe the dataset and its variables, which may be useful for further context but are not datasets themselves.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the Boston Housing dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as specified.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in a structured format that captures the essential details, including the dataset name, description, and citation, ready for further processing or review.
