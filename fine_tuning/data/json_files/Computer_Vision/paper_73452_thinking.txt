To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ModelLock: Locking Your Model With a Spell" by Yifeng Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on image classification and segmentation tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **Section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, the authors list several datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Pets Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as being used for image classification tasks. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Parkhi, O. M., Vedaldi, A., Zisserman, A., & Jawahar, C. (2012). *Cats and dogs*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 3498–3505.

2. **Cars Dataset**: Another dataset mentioned for classification tasks. The citation is:
   > Krause, J., Deng, J., Stark, M., & Fei-Fei, L. (2013). *Collecting a large-scale dataset of fine-grained cars*. 2013.

3. **Food-101 Dataset**: This dataset is also used for classification tasks. The citation is:
   > Bossard, L., Guillaumin, M., & Van Gool, L. (2014). *Food-101–mining discriminative components with random forests*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pp. 446–461.

4. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: A well-known dataset for image classification. The citation is:
   > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

5. **STL-10 Dataset**: Another dataset mentioned for classification tasks. The citation is:
   > Coates, A., Ng, A., & Lee, H. (2011). *An analysis of single-layer networks in unsupervised feature learning*. In Proceedings of the AISTATS, pp. 215–223.

6. **ChestX-ray14 Dataset**: This dataset is used for medical image classification. The citation is:
   > Wang, Y., Li, J., Liu, H., Wang, Y., Wu, Y., Huang, F., & Ji, R. (2017). *ChestX-ray14: Hospital-scale chest x-ray dataset of 14 common thorax disease categories*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 2097–2106.

7. **Cityscapes Dataset**: This dataset is used for object detection and segmentation tasks. The citation is:
   > Coates, A., Ng, A., & Lee, H. (2011). *An analysis of single-layer networks in unsupervised feature learning*. In Proceedings of the AISTATS, pp. 215–223.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile their full citations accurately as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation, ready for any further processing or review.
