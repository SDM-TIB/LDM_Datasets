        "dcterms:description": "A dataset consisting of 199 prostate patients with IMRT plans was used to generate volumetric MC dose maps for algorithm verification. This data pool was randomly split into 162 cases as the training dataset and 37 cases as the validation dataset. For training purposes, two independent noisy MC simulations, each with 1 × 10^6 histories, were conducted for each patient case in the training dataset. For validation purposes, 15 independent noisy MC simulations, each with 1 × 10^6 photon histories, were conducted for each patient case in the validation dataset. A 'clean' simulation with 1 × 10^9 histories for each patient served as the ground truth dose map.",
