To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Unsupervised Surgical Instrument Segmentation via Anchor Generation and Semantic Diffusion" by Daochang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on the **2017 MICCAI EndoVis Robotic Instrument Segmentation Challenge dataset**, which is a strong indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look closely at the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of surgical instrument segmentation and the need for annotated data. They mention that their method is evaluated on the EndoVis 2017 dataset, confirming its significance in their research.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide more details about the dataset. They specify that the EndoVis 2017 dataset consists of 10 abdominal porcine procedures videotaped by the da Vinci Xi systems. This section also highlights that their method focuses on the binary instrument segmentation task without using any manual annotations, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's application.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the EndoVis 2017 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **2017 MICCAI EndoVis Robotic Instrument Segmentation Challenge dataset**, the citation is:
  > Allan, M., Shvets, A., Kurmann, T., Zhang, Z., Duggal, R., Su, Y.H., Rieke, N., Laina, I., Kalavakonda, N., Bodenstedt, S., et al. *2017 robotic instrument segmentation challenge*. In: arXiv:1902.06426 (2019).

Additionally, the authors mention experiments conducted on the **ISIC 2016 dataset** for skin lesion segmentation. I will also extract this dataset's details and citation.

In the **experiments section**, they describe the ISIC 2016 dataset, which is used for skin lesion segmentation tasks. The citation for this dataset is:

- For the **ISIC 2016 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gutman, D., Codella, N.C., Celebi, E., Helba, B., Marchetti, M., Mishra, N., Halpern, A. *Skin lesion analysis toward melanoma detection: A challenge at the international symposium on biomedical imaging (ISBI) 2016, hosted by the international skin imaging collaboration (ISIC)*. arXiv:1605.01397 (2016).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
