To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Variational Motion Prior for Video-based Motion Capture" by Xin Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments over both public datasets and in-the-wild videos, which indicates that there are specific datasets being utilized. I will look for any explicit mentions of dataset names or descriptions.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Data Collection."

Upon reviewing Section 5.1, I find that the authors mention three datasets:

1. **AMASS**: This is described as a large motion capture database containing diverse motions and body shapes on the SMPL body model. The authors note that they sub-sample the dataset to 25 FPS and add random Gaussian noise to the 3D motion data for training their variational motion prior.

2. **Human3.6M**: This dataset is characterized as a large 3D human pose dataset acquired by recording the performances of multiple subjects under various viewpoints in a fixed indoor environment.

3. **3DPW**: This dataset is described as an in-the-wild 3D human pose dataset captured based on video and IMU sensors outdoors, widely used for 3D human pose estimation tasks.

Additionally, the authors mention that they also used in-the-wild data, which consists of 67 video clips downloaded from YouTube, including various activities like dance and aerobics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **AMASS**, the citation is:
  > Mahmood, N., Ghorbani, N., Troje, N. F., Pons-Moll, G., & Black, M. J. (2019). AMASS: Archive of motion capture as surface shapes. In International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 5442–5451.

- For **Human3.6M**, the citation is:
  > Ionescu, C., Papava, D., Olaru, V., & Sminchisescu, C. (2014). Human3.6m: Large scale datasets and predictive methods for 3d human sensing in natural environments. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 36(7), 1325–1339.

- For **3DPW**, the citation is:
  > von Marcard, T., Henschel, R., Black, M., Rosenhahn, B., & Pons-Moll, G. (2018). Recovering accurate 3D human pose in the wild using IMUs and a moving camera. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pp. 1–17.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach allows me to extract and document the datasets effectively, maintaining the integrity of the citations.
