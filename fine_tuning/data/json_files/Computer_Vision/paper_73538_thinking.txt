To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Perception of Prevalence of Cheating and Usage of Generative AI" by Roman Denkin, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any datasets that are explicitly referenced or described. The abstract mentions that data was collected via an **anonymous survey of teachers** and analyzed alongside **institutional statistics on cheating investigations from 2004 to 2023**. This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Methodology section**, specifically the **Data Sources** subsection, where the author lists the two primary sources of data:

1. **Anonymous Teachers Survey**: This dataset consists of responses from teachers within the Department of Information Technology at Uppsala University. It captures subjective views on the prevalence of cheating and the impact of Generative AI.

2. **Student Cheating Investigation Statistics**: This dataset is obtained from the Legal Administration of Uppsala University and details the number of cheating investigations conducted annually from 2004 to 2023.

I will also check the **Results section** to confirm that these datasets were indeed analyzed and discussed in the context of the research findings. The results indicate trends in cheating prevalence and perceptions among teachers, which are directly linked to the datasets mentioned.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from the author's own survey and institutional statistics, they may not have formal citations like published datasets. Instead, I will note the details as follows:

- For the **Anonymous Teachers Survey**, I will document it as:
  > Denkin, R. (2023). Anonymous Teachers Survey conducted at the Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University.

- For the **Student Cheating Investigation Statistics**, I will document it as:
  > Uppsala University. (2004-2023). Student Cheating Investigation Statistics, Legal Administration.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
