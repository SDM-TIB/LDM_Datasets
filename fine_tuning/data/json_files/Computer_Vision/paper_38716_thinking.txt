To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "FIGR: Few-shot Image Generation with Reptile" by Louis Clouâtre and Marc Demers, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors successfully generate novel images on both **MNIST** and **Omniglot** datasets, and they introduce a new dataset called **FIGR-8**. This gives me a clear starting point.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about these datasets. The introduction reiterates the use of **MNIST** and **Omniglot** and emphasizes the contribution of the **FIGR-8** dataset, which contains a large number of images and classes.

I will then focus on the **datasets section (Section 4)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of each dataset:

1. **MNIST**: This dataset contains 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits, with a total of 60,000 training images. The authors reference the MNIST dataset as a foundational dataset for their experiments.

2. **Omniglot**: This dataset consists of 1,623 unique handwritten characters from 50 different alphabets, with each character written once by 20 different individuals. It is noted as a standard benchmark for few-shot image generation tasks.

3. **FIGR-8**: This is a newly introduced dataset containing 1,548,944 images categorized into 18,409 classes. Each class has at least 8 images, and the dataset is designed to challenge few-shot image generation models.

After gathering the descriptions, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. 2010.

- For **Omniglot**, the citation is:
  > Oriol Vinyals, Charles Blundell, Tim Lillicrap, Koray Kavukcuoglu, and Daan Wierstra. *Matching networks for one shot learning*. In D. D. Lee, M. Sugiyama, U. V. Luxburg, I. Guyon, and R. Garnett, editors, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 29, pages 3630–3638. Curran Associates, Inc., 2016.

- For **FIGR-8**, since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite the paper itself as the source:
  > Louis Clouâtre and Marc Demers. *FIGR: Few-shot Image Generation with Reptile*. 2023.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary information for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
