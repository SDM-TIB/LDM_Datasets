To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Hierarchical 3D Gaussian Representation for Real-Time Rendering of Very Large Datasets" by Bernhard Kerbl et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the introduction, the authors mention using a dataset provided by Wayve and three datasets they captured themselves. This is a good indication that I need to find more details about these datasets.

In the **implementation** section, the authors provide statistics about the datasets they captured, specifically naming three scenes: **SmallCity**, **BigCity**, and **Campus**. They also mention the dataset provided by Wayve. I will note down the details provided for each dataset, including the number of images, distances covered, and the area of capture.

The paper includes a **table (Table 1)** summarizing the statistics of the datasets, which will be crucial for my extraction. The relevant details are:

1. **SmallCity Dataset**: 
   - Number of Images: 5,822
   - Distance: 450 m
   - Area: 40,000 m²
   - Number of Cameras: 6

2. **BigCity Dataset**: 
   - Number of Images: 38,235
   - Distance: 7 km
   - Area: 530,000 m²
   - Number of Cameras: 6

3. **Campus Dataset**: 
   - Number of Images: 22,042
   - Distance: 1.6 km
   - Area: 55,000 m²
   - Number of Cameras: 5

4. **Wayve Dataset**: 
   - Number of Images: 11,520
   - Distance: 1 km
   - Area: 110,000 m²
   - Number of Cameras: 6

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors do not provide specific citations for the datasets they captured, but they do mention that the Wayve dataset is publicly available. I will note that the citation for the Wayve dataset is not explicitly provided in the paper.

Now, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Wayve dataset if available. Since the paper does not provide a specific citation for the datasets they captured, I will note that they plan to release their datasets publicly, which may include the necessary citation details upon release.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets with their respective details, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or processing.
