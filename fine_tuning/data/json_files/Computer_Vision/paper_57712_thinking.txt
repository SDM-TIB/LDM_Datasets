To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EgoLoc: Revisiting 3D Object Localization from Egocentric Videos with Visual Queries" by Jinjie Mai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the **Ego4D Episodic Memory Benchmark**, which suggests that this is a significant dataset related to the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. Here, the authors discuss the **Ego4D** dataset in detail, indicating that it is a massive-scale dataset for episodic memory tasks from egocentric videos. This is a clear indication that Ego4D is a primary dataset used in their research.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any additional datasets that might be referenced. The authors mention that the **VQ3D task** is part of the Ego4D benchmark, which further confirms that Ego4D is central to their work. They also provide details about the number of video clips and visual queries associated with this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Ego4D dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Kristen Grauman, Andrew Westbury, Eugene Byrne, Zachary Chavis, Antonino Furnari, Rohit Girdhar, Jackson Hamburger, Hao Jiang, Miao Liu, Xingyu Liu, et al. *Ego4D: Around the world in 3,000 hours of egocentric video*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 18995â€“19012, 2022.

Since Ego4D is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will summarize my findings:

1. **Ego4D Dataset**: This dataset is used for the VQ3D task, which involves localizing objects in 3D from egocentric videos. It contains a large number of video clips and visual queries.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their citations as required.
