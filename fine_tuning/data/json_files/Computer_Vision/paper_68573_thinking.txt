To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Data Augmentation for Aspect Sentiment Quad Prediction" by Wenyuan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on four public benchmarks, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4.1) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets: **Rest15**, **Rest16**, **Restaurant**, and **Laptop**. I will note down these names and any relevant details provided about them.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will help in understanding the context of each dataset. 

The citations I will look for are:

1. **Rest15 Dataset**: 
   > Maria Pontiki, Dimitris Galanis, Haris Papageorgiou, Ion Androutsopoulos, Suresh Manandhar, Mohammad AL-Smadi, Mahmoud Al-Ayyoub, Yanyan Zhao, Bing Qin, Orphée De Clercq, Véronique Hoste, Marianna Apidianaki, Xavier Tannier, Natalia Loukachevitch, Evgeniy Kotelnikov, Nuria Bel, Salud María Jiménez-Zafra, and Gülşen Eryiğit. *SemEval-2016 task 5: Aspect based sentiment analysis*. In SemEval, 2016, pp. 19–30.

2. **Rest16 Dataset**: 
   > Maria Pontiki, Dimitris Galanis, Haris Papageorgiou, Ion Androutsopoulos, Suresh Manandhar, Mohammad AL-Smadi, Mahmoud Al-Ayyoub, Yanyan Zhao, Bing Qin, Orphée De Clercq, Véronique Hoste, Marianna Apidianaki, Xavier Tannier, Natalia Loukachevitch, Evgeniy Kotelnikov, Nuria Bel, Salud María Jiménez-Zafra, and Gülşen Eryiğit. *SemEval-2016 task 5: Aspect based sentiment analysis*. In SemEval, 2016, pp. 19–30.

3. **Restaurant Dataset**: 
   > Hongjie Cai, Rui Xia, and Jianfei Yu. *Aspect-category-opinion-sentiment quadruple extraction with implicit aspects and opinions*. In ACL, 2021, pp. 340–350.

4. **Laptop Dataset**: 
   > Hongjie Cai, Rui Xia, and Jianfei Yu. *Aspect-category-opinion-sentiment quadruple extraction with implicit aspects and opinions*. In ACL, 2021, pp. 340–350.

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
