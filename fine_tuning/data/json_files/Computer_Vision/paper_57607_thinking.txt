To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VINDLU: A Recipe for Effective Video-and-Language Pretraining" by Feng Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the performance of the proposed method on various video-and-language tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup and results sections**. In these sections, the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their content or structure.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **WebVid-2M**: This dataset is used for pretraining the model. It consists of 2 million video-text pairs, which is crucial for the model's training phase.

2. **CC3M**: This dataset contains 3 million image-text pairs and is used in conjunction with WebVid-2M for joint pretraining.

3. **MSR-VTT**: A widely used dataset for video-to-text retrieval, containing 10,000 videos and 200,000 captions. It is mentioned as one of the evaluation datasets.

4. **DiDeMo**: This dataset includes 10,000 Flicker videos with 41,000 captions, used for paragraph-to-video retrieval tasks.

5. **ActivityNet-Captions**: This dataset consists of 20,000 YouTube videos with 100,000 captions, also used for evaluation.

6. **SSv2-Template** and **SSv2-Label**: These datasets are used for evaluating the model's performance on temporally-heavy tasks.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the references section of the paper:

After compiling this information, I will format it according to the specified requirements for dataset extraction, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
