To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NUMSnet: Nested-U Multi-class Segmentation network for 3D Medical Image Stacks" by Sohini Roychowdhury, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors analyze the performance of their model on **Lung-CT** and **Heart-CT** volumetric image stacks, which suggests that these are the datasets used.

Next, I will examine **section III (Materials and Methods)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they mention two categories of datasets:

1. **Lung-CT Datasets**:
   - **Lung-med Dataset**: This dataset contains 829 images from a single 3D image stack, with 373 annotated scans.
   - **Lung-rad Dataset**: This dataset consists of 9 axial volume chest CT scans, with varying numbers of images per stack (39-418 images).

2. **Heart-CT Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from the MICCAI 2017 Multi-Modality Whole Heart Segmentation challenge, containing 10 training CT image stacks with annotations for up to 7 heart-specific regions of interest.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Lung-med Dataset**, the citation is:
> Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology. *Lung-med volumetric stack dataset*. Available at: [insert URL if available].

For the **Lung-rad Dataset**, the citation is:
> Ministry for Primary Industries. *COVID-19 CT segmentation dataset*. Available at: http://medicalsegmentation.com/covid19/.

For the **Heart-CT Dataset**, the citation is:
> MICCAI 2017 Multi-Modality Whole Heart Segmentation Challenge. *Heart-CT dataset*. Available at: [insert URL if available].

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further research and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
