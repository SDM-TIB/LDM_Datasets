To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLIP4Caption++: Multi-CLIP for Video Caption" by Mingkang Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method achieves scores on three datasets: **VATEX**, **YC2C**, and **TVC**. This is a good starting point, as it explicitly lists the datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about these datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of video captioning and mentions the use of multiple datasets, confirming that VATEX, YC2C, and TVC are indeed central to the research.

I will then look at the **datasets section** (which is labeled as "Datasets" in the paper) to find specific details about each dataset. The paper provides performance metrics for the three datasets, which reinforces their significance in the experiments. 

Now, I will gather the necessary details for each dataset:

1. **VATEX**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of achieving a CIDEr score of 86.5. I will look for its full citation in the **References section**.
   
2. **YC2C**: Similar to VATEX, this dataset is also referenced with a CIDEr score of 148.4. I will find its citation as well.

3. **TVC**: This dataset is mentioned with a CIDEr score of 64.5. I will ensure to extract its citation from the references.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for their full citations:

- For **VATEX**, the citation is:
  > Xin Wang, Jiawei Wu, Junkun Chen, Lei Li, Yuan-Fang Wang, and William Yang Wang. *VATEX: A large-scale, high-quality multilingual dataset for video-and-language research*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 4581–4591, 2019.

- For **YC2C**, the citation is:
  > Luowei Zhou, Chenliang Xu, and Jason J Corso. *Towards automatic learning of procedures from web instructional videos*. In Thirty-Second AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2018.

- For **TVC**, the citation is:
  > Jie Lei, Licheng Yu, Tamara L Berg, and Mohit Bansal. *Tvr: A large-scale dataset for video-subtitle moment retrieval*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2020: 16th European Conference, Glasgow, UK, August 23–28, 2020, Proceedings, Part XXI 16, pages 447–463. Springer, 2020.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
