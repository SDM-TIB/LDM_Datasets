To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sifting through the Noise: A Survey of Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Their Applications to Biomolecules" by Trevor Norton and Debswapna Bhattacharya, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss applications and methodologies** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on the sections that are likely to contain specific dataset references.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. If the authors refer to specific datasets used in their research or in the context of diffusion models applied to biomolecules, I will note them down.

I will then examine the **applications section** and any subsequent sections that detail experiments or results. These sections often contain specific references to datasets used for training or evaluation purposes. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize datasets or their characteristics.

If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, I will review it thoroughly. This section typically provides detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their sizes, types, and any relevant characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Protein Data Bank (PDB)", I would look for the citation that describes the PDB, which might be something like:
> Berman, H. M., Westbrook, J., Feng, Z., Gilliland, G., Bhat, T. N., Weissig, H., & Shindyalov, I. N. (2000). The Protein Data Bank. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 28(1), 235-242.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all citations are complete and correctly formatted.
