To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning Forecasts Caldera Collapse Events at K¯ılauea Volcano" by Ian W. McBrearty and Paul Segall, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the study utilizes "locally recorded GPS, tilt, and seismicity data" for predicting caldera collapse events. This indicates that these data types are crucial for the research and may be considered as datasets.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods** section, where the authors describe their approach. Here, they detail the use of "GPS from five extra-caldera stations," "a single extra-caldera tiltmeter," and "cumulative seismicity counts from the relocated catalog of Shelly & Thelen (2019)." This provides a clear indication of the datasets being utilized.

In the **results** section, the authors discuss the performance of their model using these datasets, confirming their importance in the analysis. They also mention the specific number of collapse events (39) and the timeframes involved, which further contextualizes the datasets.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

1. For the GPS and tilt data, the authors refer to the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) data, but they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset. However, I can note that it is a publicly available dataset from the HVO.

2. For the seismicity data, they reference:
   > Shelly, D. R., & Thelen, W. A. (2019). Anatomy of a caldera collapse: K¯ılauea 2018 summit seismicity sequence in high resolution. *Geophysical Research Letters*.

3. The authors also mention the work of Neal et al. (2019) regarding the eruption and collapse events, which can be cited as:
   > Neal, C. A., Brantley, S., Antolik, L., Babb, J., Burgess, M., Calles, K., . . . others (2019). The 2018 rift eruption and summit collapse of K¯ılauea volcano. *Science*, 363(6425), 367–374.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **GPS Data**: Collected from five extra-caldera stations during the 2018 K¯ılauea eruption.
   - Citation: Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) data (no specific citation provided).

2. **Tilt Data**: Recorded from a single extra-caldera tiltmeter during the same period.
   - Citation: Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) data (no specific citation provided).

3. **Seismicity Data**: Cumulative seismicity counts from the relocated catalog.
   - Citation: Shelly, D. R., & Thelen, W. A. (2019). Anatomy of a caldera collapse: K¯ılauea 2018 summit seismicity sequence in high resolution. *Geophysical Research Letters*.

4. **Caldera Collapse Events Data**: Data regarding the 39 caldera collapse events during the eruption.
   - Citation: Neal, C. A., Brantley, S., Antolik, L., Babb, J., Burgess, M., Calles, K., . . . others (2019). The 2018 rift eruption and summit collapse of K¯ılauea volcano. *Science*, 363(6425), 367–374.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
