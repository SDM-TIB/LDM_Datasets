To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Zero-Shot Learning with Fewer Seen Class Examples" by Vinay Kumar Verma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions conducting experiments on "four benchmark datasets of ZSL," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors provide a table summarizing the datasets used. The table lists four datasets:

1. **AwA2**: This dataset is described as having 37,322 images, with 40 seen classes and 10 unseen classes. The attributes dimension is 85.

2. **CUB**: The Caltech-UCSD Birds dataset contains 11,788 images, with 150 seen classes and 50 unseen classes. It has 312 attributes.

3. **SUN**: The SUN dataset consists of 14,340 images, with 645 seen classes and 72 unseen classes. The attributes dimension is 102.

4. **aPY**: This dataset has 15,339 images, with 20 seen classes and 12 unseen classes. The attributes dimension is 64.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **AwA2**, the citation is:
  > Xian, Y., Lampert, C. H., Schiele, B., & Akata, Z. (2018). Zero-shot learningâ€”a comprehensive evaluation of the good, the bad and the ugly. *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*.

- For **CUB**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset. *California Institute of Technology*.

- For **SUN**, the citation is:
  > Xiao, J., Hays, J., Ehinger, K. A., Oliva, A., & Torralba, A. (2010). SUN database: Large-scale scene recognition from abbey to zoo. *IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition*.

- For **aPY**, the citation is:
  > Farhadi, A., Endres, I., Hoiem, D., & Forsyth, D. A. (2009). Describing objects by their attributes. *IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition*.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper along with their full citations.
