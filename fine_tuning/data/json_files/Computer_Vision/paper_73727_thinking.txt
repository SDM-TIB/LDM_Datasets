To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gaussian Recombining Split Tree" by Yury Lebedev and Arunava Banerjee, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of market data for empirical analysis, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe their data extraction and analysis process. In this section, they mention using the **Warton Research Data Services (WRDS) NYSE Trade and Quote (TAQ) dataset**. This dataset is crucial as it provides detailed tick-by-tick trade and quote data for transactions in the U.S. National Market System.

I will also check the **experiments or results section** to see if any additional datasets are referenced. However, the primary dataset appears to be the TAQ dataset, which is used for training data in their analysis.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the TAQ dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Wharton Research Data Services. NYSE Millisecond Trades and Quotes (TAQ), 2024, Accessed: 01-01-2023.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will summarize it as follows:

1. **TAQ Dataset**: This dataset provides detailed tick-by-tick trade and quote data encompassing all transactions in the U.S. National Market System, covering more than 10,000 stock issues across 16 major American exchanges.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant information is captured accurately and is easily accessible for future reference.
