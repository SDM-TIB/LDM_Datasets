To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLIP Meets Model Zoo Experts: Supervision for Visual Enhancement" by Mohammadreza Salehi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method across various vision tasks, which suggests the involvement of multiple datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for probing different tasks. Here, they mention several datasets:

1. **PASCAL VOC**: This dataset is used for semantic segmentation tasks. The authors note that it contains 20 classes and is a standard benchmark in the field.

2. **ADE20K**: Another dataset for semantic segmentation, which includes 150 classes. The authors mention that it is used to evaluate the performance of their method.

3. **COCO**: This dataset is utilized for object detection and instance segmentation tasks. The authors highlight its importance in evaluating the performance of their model.

4. **NYU-V2**: This dataset is used for both monocular depth estimation and surface normal estimation tasks. The authors mention that it serves as a benchmark for these specific tasks.

5. **ImageNet**: A well-known dataset for image classification tasks, which is also referenced in the context of evaluating their model's performance.

6. **Places365**: Another dataset for image classification, mentioned alongside ImageNet.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
