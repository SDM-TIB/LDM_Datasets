To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Blending Gradient Boosted Trees and Neural Networks for Point and Probabilistic Forecasting of Hierarchical Time Series" by Ioannis Nasios and Konstantinos Vogklis, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in the **M5 Competition**, which is a significant clue that a dataset is involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the M5 forecasting competition and mention that it involved **42,840 hierarchical sales data from Walmart**. This is a clear indication of a dataset, and I need to gather more details about it.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. In the introduction, they provide a brief overview of the dataset's characteristics, including its hierarchical structure and the time period it covers (February 2011 to April 2016). 

The paper also describes the dataset's aggregation levels in **Table 1**, which outlines the hierarchical structure of the data. This table confirms the dataset's complexity and the number of unique combinations at different levels.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the M5 dataset. The authors reference the M5 competition results, which is crucial for proper citation. The citation for the M5 dataset is:

- **M5 Competition Dataset**:
  > Makridakis, S., Spiliotis, E., & Assimakopoulos, V. (2020). The M5 accuracy competition: Results, findings and conclusions. *International Journal of Forecasting*, 36(1), 54-74. URL: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344487258_The_M5_Accuracy_competition_Results_findings_and_conclusions.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the M5 dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
