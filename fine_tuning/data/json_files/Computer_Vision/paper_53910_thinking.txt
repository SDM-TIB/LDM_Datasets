To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Invertible Neural Networks for Graph Prediction" by Chen Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the model is tested on "real-application datasets of solar ramping event data and traffic flow anomaly detection." This suggests that these datasets are important for the experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 6) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Solar Ramping Event Data**: This dataset consists of bi-hourly radiation recordings collected from ten downtown locations in California, representing network nodes. The data is used for anomaly detection tasks.

2. **Traffic Flow Anomaly Detection Data**: This dataset includes hourly recordings from 15 traffic sensors in Los Angeles, used for detecting anomalies in traffic flow.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are likely proprietary or specific to the authors' research, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note the context in which they are used.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format:

- For **Solar Ramping Event Data**, I will note:
  - Description: Bi-hourly radiation recordings from ten locations in California.
  - Use: Anomaly detection task.

- For **Traffic Flow Anomaly Detection Data**, I will note:
  - Description: Hourly recordings from 15 traffic sensors in Los Angeles.
  - Use: Anomaly detection task.

Since these datasets do not have formal citations, I will document them as described above, ensuring to include the context of their use in the experiments.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset information clearly, ensuring that the descriptions are concise and informative for future reference.
