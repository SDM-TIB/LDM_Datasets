To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NetDiffus: Network Traffic Generation by Diffusion Models through Time-Series Imaging" by Nirhoshan Sivaroopan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed framework on seven diverse traffic traces, indicating that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the authors elaborate on the challenges of accessing real network data and the need for synthetic data generation. They mention the use of various datasets for their experiments, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

I will then focus on **section 4.1 (Evaluation and Results)**, which is likely to contain the most detailed information about the datasets used. Here, the authors describe three main datasets:

1. **D1: Streaming Videos**: This dataset consists of videos from YouTube, Stan, and Netflix, with 20 videos from each platform, each lasting 3 minutes. The authors mention that they generated 100 traces by streaming these videos and capturing network packets.

2. **D2: Accessing Web Pages**: This dataset is publicly available and includes web surfing data from 20 websites. The authors specify that each trace has a fixed number of 5000 samples, with features such as packet direction and inter-packet gaps.

3. **D3: Traffic Generated by IoT Smart-Home Devices**: This dataset was collected by monitoring network traffic from Google Home and Amazon Alexa devices. The authors describe how they collected 1000 traces by issuing commands to the devices.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since D1 and D3 are likely original datasets created by the authors, I will focus on the publicly available dataset (D2) for which a citation can be found:

- For **D2: Accessing Web Pages**, the citation is:
  > Payap Sirinam, Mohsen Imani, Marc Juarez, and Matthew Wright. *Deep fingerprinting: Undermining website fingerprinting defenses with deep learning*. In Proceedings of the 2018 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pages 1928â€“1943, 2018.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the full citation for D2, while noting that D1 and D3 do not have external citations as they are original datasets.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness in the descriptions.
