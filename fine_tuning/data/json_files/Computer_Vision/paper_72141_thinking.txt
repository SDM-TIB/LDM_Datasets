To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analysis of Classifier-Free Guidance Weight Schedulers" by Xi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors discuss various experiments, and it is likely that they reference specific datasets used for evaluation.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of evaluating the performance of different guidance schedulers. It consists of 60,000 images across 10 classes, each with a resolution of 32x32 pixels.

2. **LAION Dataset**: The authors mention using the LAION dataset, which contains 5 billion high-quality images with paired textual descriptions, for text-to-image generation tasks.

3. **COCO Dataset**: The COCO dataset is used for evaluation, specifically the validation set, which contains 30,000 text-image paired data.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- For **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **LAION Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Schuhmann, C., Beaumont, R., Vencu, R., Gordon, C., Wightman, R., Cherti, M., et al. *LAION-5B: An open large-scale dataset for training next generation image-text models*. Adv. Neural Inform. Process. Syst., 2022.

- For **COCO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Doll√°r, P., and Zitnick, C. L. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, 2014.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
