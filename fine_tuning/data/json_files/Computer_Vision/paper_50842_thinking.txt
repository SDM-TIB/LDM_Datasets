To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Central Difference Graph Convolutional Operator for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition" by Shuangyan Miao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on two popular large-scale datasets, specifically **NTU RGB+D 60** and **NTU RGB+D 120**. This is a strong indication that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In the **Experiments** section, they explicitly mention:

1. **NTU RGB+D 60**: This dataset contains 56,880 3D skeleton video clips across 60 action classes, captured from three different camera views. The authors describe the evaluation protocols, including Cross-Subject and Cross-View, which further confirms the dataset's significance in their experiments.

2. **NTU RGB+D 120**: This dataset is noted to be more challenging, containing 114,480 action samples across 120 action classes, also captured from three camera views. The authors provide details about the evaluation metrics, including Cross-Subject and Cross-Setup, which highlights its complexity and relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **NTU RGB+D 60**, the citation is:
  > A. Shahroudy, J. Liu, T.-T. Ng, and G. Wang. *NTU RGB+D: A Large Scale Dataset for 3D Human Activity Analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1010–1019, 2016.

- For **NTU RGB+D 120**, the citation is:
  > J. Liu, A. Shahroudy, M. Perez, G. Wang, L.-Y. Duan, and A. C. Kot. *NTU RGB+D 120: A Large-Scale Benchmark for 3D Human Activity Understanding*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 42, no. 10, pp. 2684–2701, 2019.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now prepare to compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
