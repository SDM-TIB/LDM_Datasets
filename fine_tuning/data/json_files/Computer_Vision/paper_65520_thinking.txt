To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revenue sharing at music streaming platforms" by Gustavo Bergantiños and Juan D. Moreno-Ternero, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses revenue sharing methods but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors provide context about the evolution of music streaming and mention various platforms but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **methodology and analysis sections** to look for any empirical data or datasets used in their analysis.

As I review the **sections on related literature and empirical analysis**, I will pay close attention to any references to datasets or data sources. The authors discuss various studies and findings related to revenue sharing but do not seem to cite specific datasets.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are mentioned in the context of the studies cited. I will look for papers that might have provided datasets or empirical data that the authors used in their analysis.

After reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite several studies, but none of them explicitly mention datasets that can be extracted. The references primarily consist of theoretical discussions and analyses of existing literature without providing specific datasets.

Since I have not identified any datasets explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will conclude that this paper does not provide specific datasets for extraction. However, I will note the references that could potentially lead to datasets if further investigation is warranted.

In summary, I will document the following references that were mentioned in the paper, as they may be relevant for future dataset exploration:

1. Alaei, S., Makhdoumi, A., Malekian, A., & Pekeč, S. (2022). Revenue-Sharing Allocation Strategies for Two-Sided Media Platforms: Pro-Rata vs. User-Centric. *Management Science*, 68, 8699-8721.

2. Meyn, J., Kandziora, M., Albers, S., & Clement, M. (2023). Consequences of platforms’ remuneration models for digital content: initial evidence and a research agenda for streaming services. *Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science*, 51, 114-131.

3. Haampland, O., Johannessen, R., Moreau, F., & Wikstrom, P. (2022). Fairness and royalty payment systems on music streaming platforms. Mimeo.

These references may lead to datasets or empirical analyses that could be useful for further research on revenue sharing in music streaming platforms.
