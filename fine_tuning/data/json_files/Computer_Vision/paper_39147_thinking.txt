To extract datasets from the research paper titled "High-Throughput CNN Inference on Embedded ARM big.LITTLE Multi-Core Processors" by Siqi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation or experimentation. In this case, the abstract discusses the performance of CNN inference on edge devices but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will look into the **methodology and experimental sections** of the paper, as these sections typically detail the datasets used for training and testing. I will specifically check for any sections that discuss experiments, evaluations, or results, as they often include references to datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using several well-known CNN models (e.g., AlexNet, GoogLeNet, MobileNet, ResNet50, SqueezeNet) but do not specify any datasets directly in the text. However, they refer to the performance of these models, which typically rely on standard datasets like ImageNet for training and evaluation.

To ensure I capture all relevant datasets, I will also check the **references section** for any citations that might indicate datasets. If the authors reference specific datasets or papers that describe datasets, I will note those down.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets. If I find any specific datasets mentioned, I will ensure to include their full citations as follows:

1. **ImageNet Dataset**: This is a widely used dataset for image classification tasks, which includes millions of labeled images across thousands of categories. The citation for the ImageNet dataset is:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: If mentioned, this dataset is commonly used for evaluating machine learning algorithms, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

3. **COCO Dataset**: If referenced, this dataset is used for object detection, segmentation, and captioning tasks. The citation is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Sergio F. G. Vasconcelos, et al. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets I have identified, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. If no specific datasets are mentioned, I will note that the paper primarily discusses CNN models without detailing the datasets used for training or evaluation.
