To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Strengthening Layer Interaction via Dynamic Layer Attention" by Kaishen Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors conducted experiments on the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A widely used dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each, making it a more challenging dataset for classification tasks.

3. **ImageNet-1K**: A large-scale dataset used for image classification, containing over 1 million images across 1,000 classes.

4. **COCO2017**: A dataset used for object detection, segmentation, and captioning, containing over 330,000 images with more than 2.5 million labeled instances.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **ImageNet-1K**:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

- For **COCO2017**:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, et al. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation for proper attribution.
