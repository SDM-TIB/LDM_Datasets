To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BiTe-GCN: A New GCN Architecture via Bidirectional Convolution of Topology and Features on Text-Rich Networks" by Di Jin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often highlights the significance of the datasets used, so I will pay close attention to any references to datasets there.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors explicitly mention four datasets:

1. **Cora-Enrich**: This dataset consists of 2,708 scientific publications in machine learning, connected by 5,429 citation links. Each paper is labeled into one of seven categories.

2. **DBLP-Five**: A sub-collection of the original DBLP datasets, this dataset contains 6,936 scientific papers across five sub-areas in computer science, connected by 12,353 links.

3. **Hep-Small**: This dataset includes 397 scientific papers in three categories, connected by 812 links.

4. **Hep-Large**: This dataset contains 11,752 documents in four categories, connected by 134,956 links.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations based on the information provided in the paper:

- **Cora-Enrich**: 
  > Soumyajit Ganguly and Vikram Pudi. *Paper2vec: Combining Graph and Text Information for Scientific Paper Representation*. In Proceedings of the 39th European Conference on Information Retrieval, Vol. 10193, 2017, pp. 383â€“395.

- **DBLP-Five**: 
  > The original DBLP dataset is referenced in various works, but specific citation details may need to be sourced from the DBLP website or related publications.

- **Hep-Small** and **Hep-Large**: 
  > The datasets are often referenced in the context of physics papers, but specific citation details may need to be sourced from the original datasets or related publications.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and ease of use. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and provided proper citations for each.
