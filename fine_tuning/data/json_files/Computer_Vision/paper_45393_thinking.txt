To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stability of Algebraic Neural Networks to Small Perturbations" by Alejandro Parada-Mayorga and Alejandro Ribeiro, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to look for specific references to datasets in the body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any datasets used for their experiments or analyses. If they reference any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

Then, I will check the **methodology or experiments sections** (which may be labeled differently) to find explicit mentions of datasets. This is where the authors typically describe the data they used for their experiments, including any specific characteristics or sizes of the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others.

If the authors have used well-known datasets, I will verify their citations against existing literature to ensure accuracy. If they have introduced new datasets, I will extract the necessary citation information as provided in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of dataset information from the paper while maintaining the integrity of citations.
