To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative Adversarial Network for Wireless Signal Spoofing" by Yi Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and **subsequent sections** for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of wireless signal spoofing and mention the use of deep learning techniques, but they do not name any specific datasets. I will continue to the **system model** and **experiments sections** to find more concrete references to datasets.

In **section 3 (System Model)**, the authors describe the training process for a deep learning classifier and mention that they collect **1000 samples** of signals from both the intended transmitter and adversary transmitter. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name.

Next, in **section 5 (Spoofing Attacks)**, the authors detail the GAN-based spoofing attack and state that the adversary receiver collects **500 signal samples from the intended transmitter and 500 from the adversary transmitter**. Again, no specific dataset names are provided, but the number of samples is noted.

Since the paper does not explicitly name any established datasets, I will check the **References section** to see if any cited works might refer to datasets used in the experiments. 

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite several papers related to deep learning and wireless communications, but none of them appear to refer to specific datasets used in this study. The references primarily discuss methodologies and previous works rather than datasets.

Given that the paper does not provide specific dataset names or citations, I will summarize the information I have gathered:

1. **Signal Samples**: The authors collected **1000 samples** for training their classifier, with **500 samples from the intended transmitter** and **500 from the adversary transmitter**. However, these are not named datasets.

Since there are no formal datasets mentioned in the paper, I will note that while the authors describe the data collection process, they do not provide specific dataset citations or names. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract with full citations from this paper.

In summary, I will document the findings as follows:
- The paper discusses the collection of signal samples but does not reference any established datasets or provide citations for them.

This approach ensures that I have thoroughly examined the paper for any potential datasets while adhering to the importance of providing full citations, which in this case, are not available.
