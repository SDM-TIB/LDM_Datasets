To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Null-sampling for Interpretable and Fair Representations" by Thomas Kehrenberg et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that they demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on **image and tabular datasets: Coloured MNIST, the CelebA, and the Adult dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. Here, the authors provide specific information about each dataset:

1. **Coloured MNIST (cMNIST)**: This dataset is a variant of the MNIST dataset where digits are colored, and the colors have a one-to-one correspondence with the digit class in the training set. The authors describe how they manipulate the dataset to create a strong spurious correlation between color and digit class.

2. **CelebA Dataset**: This dataset consists of 202,599 celebrity images annotated with various binary attributes, including "gender" and "smiling." The authors use this dataset to evaluate their method's performance in a real-world scenario.

3. **UCI Adult Dataset**: This dataset is a census dataset commonly used to evaluate models focused on algorithmic fairness. The authors designate "gender" as the sensitive attribute and whether an individual's salary is greater than $50,000 as the target variable.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Coloured MNIST**, the original MNIST dataset citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu et al. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015.

- For **UCI Adult**, the citation is:
  > D. J. H. K. et al. *UCI Adult Dataset*. 1996.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing.
