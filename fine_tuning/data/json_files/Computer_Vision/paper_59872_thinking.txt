To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TriVol: Point Cloud Rendering via Triple Volumes" by Tao Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors discuss conducting extensive experiments on various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **ShapeNet**: A richly-annotated and large-scale 3D synthesized dataset containing about 51,300 unique 3D textured mesh models. The authors specify that they chose the common Car category for evaluation.

2. **Google Scanned Objects (GSO)**: This dataset contains over 1000 high-quality 3D-scanned household items, with experiments performed on the category of shoes.

3. **ScanNet**: A dataset that includes over 1500 indoor scenes constructed from RGBD cameras. The authors indicate that they split the first 1,200 scenes for training and the remaining for testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **ShapeNet**, the citation is:
  > Angel X. Chang, Thomas A. Funkhouser, Leonidas J. Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qi-Xing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Hao Su, Jianxiong Xiao, Li Yi, and Fisher Yu. *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. arXiv, 2015.

- For **Google Scanned Objects (GSO)**, the citation is:
  > Laura Downs, Anthony Francis, Nate Koenig, Brandon Kinman, Ryan Hickman, Krista Reymann, Thomas B. McHugh, and Vincent Vanhoucke. *Google scanned objects: A high-quality dataset of 3D scanned household items*. In ICRA, 2022.

- For **ScanNet**, the citation is:
  > Angela Dai, Angel X. Chang, Manolis Savva, Maciej Halber, Thomas Funkhouser, and Matthias Nie√üner. *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes*. In CVPR, 2017.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its full citation, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
