To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Characters as Graphs: Recognizing Online Handwritten Chinese Characters via Spatial Graph Convolutional Network" by Ji Gan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **IAHCC-UCAS2016**: This dataset is described as a public in-air handwritten Chinese character dataset containing 431,825 samples across 3,755 characters. Each character class has 115 samples, with a training/test split mentioned.

2. **ICDAR-2013**: This dataset is noted as the most popular for online handwritten Chinese characters, collected by the CASIA institution. It includes sub-datasets used for training and testing, with specific sample counts provided.

3. **UNIPEN**: Although not detailed in the same section, the authors mention that they also evaluated their method on the UNIPEN dataset, which is known for isolated digits and letters.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **IAHCC-UCAS2016**, the citation is:
  > Qu, X., Wang, W., Lu, K., & Zhou, J. (2018). Data augmentation and directional feature maps extraction for in-air handwritten Chinese character recognition based on convolutional neural network. *Pattern Recognition Letters*, 111, 9-15.

- For **ICDAR-2013**, the citation is:
  > Yin, F., Wang, Q., Zhang, X., & Liu, C. (2013). ICDAR 2013 Chinese handwriting recognition competition. In *International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition* (pp. 1464-1470). IEEE.

- For **UNIPEN**, the citation is:
  > Guyon, I., Schomaker, L., Plamondon, R., Liberman, M., & Janet, S. (1994). UNIPEN project of on-line data exchange and recognizer benchmarks. In *International Conference on Pattern Recognition*.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
