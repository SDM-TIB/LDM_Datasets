To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine Learning Applications to DNA Subsequence and Restriction Site Analysis" by E. Moyer and A. Das, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it discusses machine learning methods, it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Feature Selection)** and **section IV (Data Selection & Curation)**, as these sections are likely to contain information about the datasets used in the study. In section IV, the authors mention that the dataset is obtained through the synthesis of mycobacterium structural genes during restriction synthesis. They specify that each gene sequence ranges from 1,000 to 5,000 base pairs and is obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).

To ensure I have the correct citation for this dataset, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The authors reference NCBI multiple times, and I will extract the relevant citation for the dataset:

- For the dataset obtained from NCBI, the citation is:
  > National Library of Medicine (US), National Center for Biotechnology Information. Gene [Internet]. Bethesda (MD): National Library of Medicine (US), National Center for Biotechnology Information, 2020.

Additionally, I will note that the dataset consists of approximately one million entries across almost one hundred gene synthesis simulations, with a sample of 105,000 entries selected for analysis.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Dataset Name**: Mycobacterium Structural Genes Dataset
   - **Description**: This dataset consists of gene sequences ranging from 1,000 to 5,000 base pairs, obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). It includes a total of approximately one million entries across various gene synthesis simulations, with a specific sample of 105,000 entries used for analysis.
   - **Full Citation**: National Library of Medicine (US), National Center for Biotechnology Information. Gene [Internet]. Bethesda (MD): National Library of Medicine (US), National Center for Biotechnology Information, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details and citations for the dataset used in the research paper.
