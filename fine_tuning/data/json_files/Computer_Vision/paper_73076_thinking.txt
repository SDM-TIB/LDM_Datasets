To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Nonequilibrium Physics of Generative Diffusion Models" by Zhendong Yu and Haiping Huang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights key datasets used in the study. 

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Experiments," "Methods," or "Datasets."** In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any subsections that explicitly mention datasets or data sources.

As I read through the relevant sections, I will take note of any datasets that are described, including their names, characteristics, and how they were used in the experiments. For example, if the authors mention using a specific dataset for training or testing their models, I will record that information.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture all necessary details, such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

If the paper mentions any datasets that are derived from other works, I will trace back to the original sources to provide accurate citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is clear and complete.

Finally, I will format the extracted information in a structured manner, ready for further processing or review.
