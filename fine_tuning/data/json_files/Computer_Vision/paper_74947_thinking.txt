To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ScoreFusion: Fusing Score-based Generative Models via Kullbackâ€“Leibler Barycenters" by Hao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of numerical experiments involving mixture models and image datasets, which suggests that specific datasets may be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors mention conducting numerical experiments with "mixtures models and image datasets." I will look for specific names of datasets used in these experiments.

Upon reviewing Section 5.1, I find that the authors conducted experiments on **bimodal Gaussian mixture distributions**. However, they do not specify a dataset name here, as this is a synthetic dataset created for the purpose of the experiment.

In Section 5.2, the authors mention using the **EMNIST dataset** (an extension of the MNIST dataset) for their experiments. This is a specific dataset that I need to document.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the EMNIST dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Cohen, G., Afshar, S., Tapson, J., & Van Schaik, A. (2017). EMNIST: Extending MNIST to handwritten letters. In *2017 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)* (pp. 2921-2926). IEEE.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will summarize my findings:

1. **EMNIST Dataset**: Used for experiments involving handwritten digits.
   - Citation: Cohen, G., Afshar, S., Tapson, J., & Van Schaik, A. (2017). EMNIST: Extending MNIST to handwritten letters. In *2017 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)* (pp. 2921-2926). IEEE.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
