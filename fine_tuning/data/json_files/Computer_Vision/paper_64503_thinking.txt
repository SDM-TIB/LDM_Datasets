To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Context Dual Hyper-Prior Neural Image Compression" by Atefeh Khoshkhahtinat et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on a dataset, which indicates that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments and mention using a combined set of images from various datasets for training and evaluation. Specifically, they state that they utilized a combined set of **5,285 high-resolution images from datasets DIV2K, Flickr2K, and CLIC2021** for training, and the evaluation set consists of images from the **Kodak dataset**.

Now, I will gather the details for each dataset mentioned:

1. **DIV2K Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for image restoration tasks and contains 2,000 high-resolution images. It is widely recognized in the image processing community.

2. **Flickr2K Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,000 high-resolution images sourced from Flickr, often used for various image processing tasks.

3. **CLIC2021 Dataset**: This dataset is part of the Challenge on Learned Image Compression (CLIC) and includes images specifically curated for evaluating image compression algorithms.

4. **Kodak Dataset**: This dataset contains 24 images and is frequently used as a benchmark for evaluating image compression methods.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **DIV2K Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Agustsson, E., & Timofte, R. (2017). *NTIRE 2017 Challenge on Single Image Super-Resolution: Dataset and Study*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

- For **Flickr2K Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lim, B., Son, S., Kim, H., Nah, S., & Lee, K. M. (2017). *Enhanced Deep Residual Networks for Single Image Super-Resolution*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

- For **CLIC2021 Dataset**, the citation is:

- For **Kodak Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kodak. (2022). *Kodak Image Dataset*. Available at https://r0k.us/graphics/kodak/.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I have accurately represented the datasets used in the research paper.
