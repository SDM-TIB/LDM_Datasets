To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Energy Efficient Distributed Analytics at the Edge of the Network for IoT Environments" by Lorenzo Valerio et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will specifically look for sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as **section 5 (Experimental Setting)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors mention a dataset related to the forest cover type prediction problem, known as the **CovType dataset**. 

I will note the details provided about the dataset, including the number of observations, features, and the learning task associated with it. The paper states that the CovType dataset contains 581,012 observations with 54 features, and after sub-sampling, it is reduced to 19,229 points for analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CovType dataset. The paper mentions that the dataset is publicly available and provides a URL for access. I will ensure to include this URL in the citation.

The full citation for the CovType dataset is:
> "CovType Dataset." UCI Machine Learning Repository. Available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Covertype.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and its citation in a structured format, ensuring that I include all relevant aspects such as the dataset name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured output that is ready for review or further processing.
