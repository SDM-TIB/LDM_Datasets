To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unleashing the Denoising Capability of Diffusion Prior for Solving Inverse Problems" by Jiawei Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on the image restoration tasks and source separation and partial generation tasks," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

Upon reviewing the experiments, I find that the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **ImageNet**: This dataset is used for various image restoration tasks, including super-resolution, inpainting, and Gaussian deblurring. It is a well-known dataset containing millions of labeled images across thousands of categories.

2. **CelebA**: This dataset is specifically used for face-related tasks, including image restoration. It contains over 200,000 celebrity images with annotations for various attributes.

3. **FFHQ (Flickr-Faces-HQ)**: This dataset is used for nonlinear restoration tasks. It consists of high-quality images of human faces, providing a diverse range of attributes.

4. **SLACK2100**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of source separation tasks. It is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in separating audio tracks of different instruments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), December 2015.

- For **FFHQ**, the citation is:
  > Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. *A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 4401–4410, 2019.

- For **SLACK2100**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
