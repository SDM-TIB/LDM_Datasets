To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convolutional Neural Network Models for Cancer Type Prediction Based on Gene Expression" by Milad Mostavi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors used a combined dataset of **10,340 samples of 33 cancer types and 731 matched normal tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)**. This is a clear indication that TCGA is a primary dataset used in their research.

Next, I will examine the **Methods section**, specifically the **Datasets subsection**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they used. Here, they mention that they downloaded pan-cancer RNA-Seq data from TCGA using the R/Bioconductor package TCGAbiolinks. They specify the number of samples and the types of tissues included, confirming the dataset's relevance.

In the **Results section**, the authors discuss their findings based on the dataset, which further reinforces the importance of the TCGA dataset in their analysis.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the TCGA dataset. The citation for TCGA is typically referenced in the context of its original publication. In this case, the relevant citation is:

- For **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)**, the citation is:
  > Grossman RL, Heath AP, Ferretti V, Varmus HE, Lowy DR, Kibbe WA, Staudt LM. *Toward a Shared Vision for Cancer Genomic Data*. N Engl J Med. 2016;375(12):1109-1112.

Since TCGA is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation.

After gathering all necessary details, I will ensure that the dataset entry is complete and ready for any further processing or review.
