To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling Spatial Nonstationarity via Deformable Convolutions for Deep Traffic Flow Prediction" by Wei Zeng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention the datasets used. In this case, it does not explicitly name any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section, which is often included in research papers. In this paper, I find that the datasets are described in **section 4.1 (Datasets)**. Here, the authors provide statistics and details about the datasets used for their experiments.

The paper mentions three datasets:

1. **TaxiBJ**: This dataset records taxicab GPS data in Beijing over a period of 528 days, divided into 30-minute time slots, resulting in a total of 22,459 time slots. The dataset does not have TAZ (Traffic Analysis Zones).

2. **BikeNYC**: This dataset contains bike trajectories from the NYC Bike System, covering 183 days with 60-minute time slots, yielding 4,392 time slots. This dataset also does not have TAZ.

3. **TaxiSZ**: This dataset records taxi transactions in Shenzhen over 181 days, with 30-minute time slots, resulting in 8,688 time slots. It includes 491 TAZs.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **TaxiBJ**: 
  > Wei Zeng, Chengqiao Lin, Kang Liu, Juncong Lin, and Anthony K. H. Tung. *Modeling Spatial Nonstationarity via Deformable Convolutions for Deep Traffic Flow Prediction*. IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 2023.

- **BikeNYC**: 
  > Wei Zeng, Chengqiao Lin, Kang Liu, Juncong Lin, and Anthony K. H. Tung. *Modeling Spatial Nonstationarity via Deformable Convolutions for Deep Traffic Flow Prediction*. IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 2023.

- **TaxiSZ**: 
  > Wei Zeng, Chengqiao Lin, Kang Liu, Juncong Lin, and Anthony K. H. Tung. *Modeling Spatial Nonstationarity via Deformable Convolutions for Deep Traffic Flow Prediction*. IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 2023.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
