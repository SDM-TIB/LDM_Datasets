To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EEG2Vec: Learning Affective EEG Representations via Variational Autoencoders" by David Bethge et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "affective EEG recording datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods** and **Experimental Study** sections, as these are likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for the experiments. In the **Experimental Dataset** subsection, the authors specifically mention using the **STJU Emotion EEG Dataset (SEED)**. They describe it as containing 62-channel EEG recordings sampled at 1000Hz from 15 participants, with three distinct emotion classes: negative, neutral, and positive.

I will also check the **References** section to find the full citation for the STJU Emotion EEG Dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> W.-L. Zheng, W. Liu, Y. Lu, B. Lu, and A. Cichocki. "Emotionmeter: A multimodal framework for recognizing human emotions." *IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics*, pp. 1–13, 2018.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference several other datasets in the context of their work, such as:
- DEAP: A database for emotion analysis using physiological signals.
- DREAMER: A database for emotion recognition through EEG and ECG signals from wireless low-cost off-the-shelf devices.
- AMIGOS: A dataset for affect, personality, and mood research on individuals and groups.

I will extract the full citations for these datasets as well:
- For DEAP:
  > Koelstra, S., et al. "DEAP: A database for emotion analysis using physiological signals." *IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing*, vol. 3, no. 1, pp. 18–31, 2012.
  
- For DREAMER:
  > Katsigiannis, S., and Ramzan, N. "DREAMER: A database for emotion recognition through EEG and ECG signals from wireless low-cost off-the-shelf devices." *IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics*, vol. 22, no. 1, pp. 98–107, 2017.

- For AMIGOS:
  > Miranda-Correa, J. A., et al. "Amigos: A dataset for affect, personality and mood research on individuals and groups." *IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing*, vol. 12, no. 2, pp. 479–493, 2018.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
