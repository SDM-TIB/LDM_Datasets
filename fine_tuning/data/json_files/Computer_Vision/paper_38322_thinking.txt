To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Bayesian Inversion" by Jonas Adler and Ozan Öktem, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the application of their methods to "image reconstruction in ultra low dose 3D helical CT," which suggests that there may be specific datasets related to this application.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention using training data from the **Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT challenge**. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT challenge dataset. The citation is as follows:
> McCollough, C. "Overview of the low dose CT grand challenge." *Medical Physics*, 43(6):3759–3760, 2016.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper. In this case, the authors primarily focus on the Mayo Clinic dataset for their experiments, so I will ensure to highlight this as the main dataset used.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ensuring that it is ready for further processing or review.
