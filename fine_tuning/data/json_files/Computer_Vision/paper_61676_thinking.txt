To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Oscillations in p-adic diffusion processes and simulation of the conformational dynamics of protein" by A. Kh. Bikulov and A. P. Zubarev, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and discussion sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can give clues about the experiments conducted.

Next, I will look for a **dedicated section on data or experiments**, which is often labeled as "Data," "Datasets," or "Experiments." In this paper, the authors discuss the application of their models to experimental data related to protein dynamics. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets mentioned in this section.

In the **discussion section**, the authors reference various experiments and their results, which may include datasets used for validation. For example, they mention experiments on the relaxation dynamics of proteins and the kinetics of CO binding to myoglobin. I will note any specific datasets or sources cited in relation to these experiments.

I will also check the **References section** for any citations that correspond to datasets. The authors may refer to previous studies or datasets that were utilized in their analysis. It is crucial to extract the full citation for each dataset mentioned.

Based on the content of the paper, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **Spectral diffusion experiments**: The authors reference their previous work that describes the relaxation curves of spectral diffusion experiments. I will look for the original papers that provide the dataset used in these experiments.

2. **Kinetics of CO binding to myoglobin**: The authors mention that their model describes the kinetics of CO binding to myoglobin. I will identify the relevant studies that provide the dataset for this experiment.

After identifying the datasets, I will compile the full citations for each dataset as follows:

- For the spectral diffusion experiments, I will cite:
  > V. A. Avetisov, A. Kh. Bikulov, and A. P. Zubarev. "Ultrametricity and spectral diffusion in deeply frozen proteins." Biophys. Rev. Lett. 3, 387â€“396 (2008).

- For the kinetics of CO binding to myoglobin, I will cite:
  > A. Kh. Bikulov and A. P. Zubarev. "Ultrametric theory of conformational dynamics of protein molecules in a functional state and the description of experiments on the kinetics of CO binding to myoglobin." Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications 583, 126280 (2021).

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the essence of each dataset and its relevance to the research presented in the paper. This will allow me to create a structured output that includes all necessary information for further analysis or processing.
