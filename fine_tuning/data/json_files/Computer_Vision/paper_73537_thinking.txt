To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analyzing Chat Protocols of Novice Programmers Solving Introductory Programming Tasks with ChatGPT" by Andreas Scholl et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract indicates that the study involves **chat protocols submitted by students**, which suggests that there is a dataset related to these interactions.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe how data was collected. They mention that **213 students submitted their chat protocols**, which collectively contain **2335 prompts**. This is a clear indication of a dataset that consists of student interactions with ChatGPT.

In the **results section**, the authors provide quantitative data about the prompts, including the number of prompts per student and the average word count. This reinforces the existence of a dataset based on the chat protocols.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset in the **references section**. The paper does not explicitly cite a dataset in the traditional sense, but it does provide a detailed description of the data collected from students. Therefore, I will create a citation for the dataset based on the information provided in the paper.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Chat Protocols of Novice Programmers
   - **Description**: This dataset consists of chat protocols submitted by 213 students enrolled in an introductory programming course. The dataset includes a total of 2335 prompts exchanged between students and ChatGPT-3.5, providing insights into students' interactions with the AI tool while solving programming tasks.
   - **Citation**: Scholl, A., Schiffner, D., & Kiesler, N. (2024). Analyzing Chat Protocols of Novice Programmers Solving Introductory Programming Tasks with ChatGPT. In Proceedings of the 55th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE 2024), ACM, Portland, OR, USA, pp. 1147â€“1153. doi: 10.1145/3626252.3630784.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
