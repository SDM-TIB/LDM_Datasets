To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Visual Odometry and Action Integration for PointGoal Navigation in Indoor Environment" by Yijun Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the experiments were conducted on the **Gibson dataset**, which is a significant clue that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In the **Experiments section**, the authors state that they used the **Gibson dataset** for their experiments. They describe it as a widely used dataset in the field of vision navigation, which provides a strong indication of its relevance.

Additionally, the authors mention constructing a **VO dataset** for training their visual odometry model. They describe this dataset as consisting of 100,000 steps from 13,036 trajectories randomly sampled from 72 training scenes. This dataset is crucial for understanding the training process of their model.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Gibson dataset**, the citation is:
   > Xia, F., Zamir, A. R., He, Z., Sax, A., Malik, J., & Savarese, S. (2018). *Gibson env: Real-world perception for embodied agents*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 9068â€“9079.

2. For the **VO dataset**, since it is constructed by the authors, I will note that it does not have a formal citation but will describe it as follows:
   > VO dataset: A dataset created by the authors consisting of 100,000 steps from 13,036 trajectories randomly sampled from 72 training scenes.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or processing.
