To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decoding CNN based Object Classifier Using Visualization" by Abhishek Mukhopadhyay et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and proposed approach sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the visualization of CNN features, but it does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and proposed approach for more details.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference various CNN techniques and their applications in autonomous driving but do not specify any datasets. However, they mention the use of visualization techniques and refer to previous works that utilized datasets, which may indicate the presence of datasets later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **proposed approach section** closely. Here, the authors state that they prepared a dataset by mixing Indian and western road images downloaded from Kaggle and Google Images. This indicates that they created a custom dataset for their experiments, but they do not provide a specific name for this dataset.

I will also look for any references to existing datasets that may have been used in conjunction with their own dataset. The authors mention using the **VGG16 model**, which is pre-trained on the **ImageNet dataset**. This is a well-known dataset in the field of computer vision.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **ImageNet Dataset**: The citation for the ImageNet dataset is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is widely recognized in the field. A common citation for ImageNet is:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y.

2. **Custom Dataset**: The authors do not provide a formal citation for the mixed dataset of Indian and western road images, as it is based on images downloaded from Kaggle and Google Images. Therefore, I will note it as a custom dataset without a formal citation.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets identified:

- **Custom Dataset**: A dataset created by mixing Indian and western road images, sourced from Kaggle and Google Images. No formal citation is available.
- **ImageNet Dataset**: A widely used dataset for training CNNs, particularly in image classification tasks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
