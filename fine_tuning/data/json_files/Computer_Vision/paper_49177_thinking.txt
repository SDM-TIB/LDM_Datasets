To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Early-Phase Performance-Driven Design using Generative Models" by Spyridon Ampanavos and Ali Malkawi, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and case study sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the research involves generating a synthetic dataset for optimal solar gain geometries, which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **case study section (Section 4)**, particularly **subsection 4.2 (Data Generation)**, where the authors describe the process of generating a dataset of geometries. They mention that a total of 3420 pairs of boundary conditions and optimal geometries were created through optimization processes. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

In this subsection, the authors detail the characteristics of the dataset, including the number of unique boundary conditions (342) and the method used to generate the geometries (using a heightmap representation). This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. However, since the dataset is synthetic and generated specifically for this study, it may not have an external citation. Instead, I will note that the dataset is derived from the authors' own optimization processes.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset's name, description, and any relevant details about its creation. The full citation for the paper will also be included to provide proper attribution.

The citation for the paper is:
> Spyridon Ampanavos and Ali Malkawi. *Early-Phase Performance-Driven Design using Generative Models*. Harvard Graduate School of Design, Cambridge MA, 2023.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
