To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BLiRF: Band Limited Radiance Fields for Dynamic Scene Modeling" by Sameera Ramasinghe et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate results across complex dynamic scenes and that their code and data will be released. This suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the datasets used. In this section, they mention collecting **four synthetic scenes** and **four real-world scenes**. The synthetic scenes include:
1. **Color Change**: This scene involves texture changes of objects.
2. **Falling and Scale**: This scene contains objects that change scale.
3. **Light Move**: This scene includes static objects but features a moving light source.
4. **Ball Move**: This scene consists of objects with long-range movements.

The real-world scenes mentioned are:
1. **Climbing**: This scene contains long-range movements.
2. **Cat Walking**: Another scene with long-range movements.
3. **Flashlight**: This scene features light changes.
4. **Flower**: This scene has spatially concentrated dynamics.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets used in the experiments, as they appear to be original datasets created by the authors for their study.

Since the authors mention that their code and data will be released, I will note that the datasets are likely available through their project page or supplementary materials, but no formal citations are provided in the paper itself.

In summary, I will compile the dataset information as follows:

1. **Synthetic Datasets**:
   - Color Change
   - Falling and Scale
   - Light Move
   - Ball Move

2. **Real-World Datasets**:
   - Climbing
   - Cat Walking
   - Flashlight
   - Flower

Since no formal citations are provided for these datasets, I will note that they are original datasets created by the authors and may be available upon request or through their project page.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for any required structured output, ensuring that I clearly indicate the nature of the datasets and their availability.
