To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FPGA Implementation of Simplified Spiking Neural Network" by Shikhar Gupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the implementation of a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) model on FPGA but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **related work section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of previous implementations or comparisons. This section discusses various architectures and their performance but does not specify any datasets used for training or evaluation.

I will then focus on the **results section**, particularly the tables that summarize resource usage and timing analysis. Here, I will look for any mention of datasets used in experiments or comparisons. The paper does reference the MNIST dataset in the context of timing analysis for classification and training, which is a well-known dataset for image classification tasks.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is commonly cited in the literature, and I will ensure to provide the correct reference.

The full citation for the MNIST dataset is:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered about the MNIST dataset, including its purpose and details, along with the citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MNIST dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.
