To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Zero-Shot Adaptation for Approximate Posterior Sampling of Diffusion Models in Inverse Problems" by Yaşar Utku Alçalar and Mehmet Akçakaya, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the application of diffusion models to various noisy inverse problems, which suggests that datasets may be involved, particularly in the evaluation of the proposed method.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. Here, the authors discuss their method's performance on various inverse problems, which may lead to the identification of datasets used for evaluation.

In the **evaluation section**, I will pay close attention to any explicit references to datasets. The authors mention using the **FFHQ** and **ImageNet** datasets for their experiments. I will note the context in which these datasets are used, including any specific details about their application in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers who may want to access these datasets.

For the **FFHQ dataset**, the citation is:
> Karras, T., Aittala, M., Aila, T., & Laine, S. (2019). A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 4396–4405.

For the **ImageNet dataset**, the citation is:
> Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 248–255.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I provide a clear and concise overview of each dataset used in the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
