To extract datasets from the research paper titled "X-DETR: A Versatile Architecture for Instance-wise Vision-Language Tasks" by Zhaowei Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of various datasets for instance-wise vision-language tasks, which indicates that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges in vision-language understanding and mention several datasets that are commonly used in this field. I will note down any datasets explicitly named here.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in sections discussing training and experiments, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used. The authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **Flickr30k entities**: This dataset is used for grounding tasks and is mentioned in the context of object-phrase alignment.
2. **RefCOCO/RefCOCO+/RefCOCOg**: These datasets are utilized for referring expression comprehension (REC) and are critical for the evaluation of the proposed model.
3. **Visual Genome (VG)**: This dataset is referenced for dense captioning tasks.
4. **GQA**: This dataset is mentioned for visual question answering (VQA).
5. **COCO**: The authors refer to the COCO dataset for object detection annotations.
6. **OpenImages**: This dataset is also mentioned for its object annotations.
7. **Localized Narratives (LocNar)**: This dataset is used for pseudo-labeling tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference and use in future work.
