To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Thermal Image Processing via Physics-Inspired Deep Networks" by Vishwanath Saragadam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors have made their source code and datasets publicly available, which indicates that there are datasets used in their research. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (section 6) to see if the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for their experiments. This section typically contains information about the datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using images captured with the **FLIR Boson** and **FLIR Lepton** cameras. I will note these as they are specific datasets related to thermal imaging. The paper also discusses various experiments conducted with these cameras, which suggests that they are integral to the research.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations will provide the necessary details about the datasets, including authors, titles, publication venues, and years.

1. For the **FLIR Boson camera**, the citation is:
   > FLIR. *FLIR Boson: Thermal Imaging Camera*. [Online]. Available: https://www.flir.com/oem/adas/adas-dataset-form/, 2021.

2. For the **FLIR Lepton camera**, the citation is:
   > FLIR. *FLIR Lepton: Thermal Imaging Camera*. [Online]. Available: https://flirpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
