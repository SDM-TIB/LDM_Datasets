To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AnomalyCLIP: Object-Agnostic Prompt Learning for Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection" by Qihang Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **17 real-world anomaly detection datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In **section 4.1**, they explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation, which include:

1. **MVTec AD**: A comprehensive dataset for industrial anomaly detection, containing various object categories with normal and anomalous samples.
2. **VisA**: A dataset for visual anomaly detection in industrial settings.
3. **MPDD**: A dataset focused on defect detection in manufacturing.
4. **BTAD**: A dataset for detecting anomalies in industrial products.
5. **SDD**: A dataset for surface defect detection.
6. **DAGM**: A dataset for anomaly detection in industrial images.
7. **DTD-Synthetic**: A synthetic dataset for texture anomaly detection.
8. **ISIC**: A dataset for skin cancer detection.
9. **CVC-ClinicDB**: A dataset for colon polyp detection.
10. **CVC-ColonDB**: Another dataset for colon polyp detection.
11. **Kvasir**: A dataset for gastrointestinal disease detection.
12. **Endo**: A dataset for endoscopic image analysis.
13. **TN3K**: A dataset for thyroid nodule detection.
14. **HeadCT**: A dataset for brain tumor detection in CT scans.
15. **BrainMRI**: A dataset for brain tumor detection in MRI scans.
16. **Br35H**: A dataset for brain tumor detection.
17. **COVID-19**: A dataset for detecting COVID-19 in chest X-rays.

In the **References section**, I will look for the full citations for each dataset mentioned. For example, the citation for **MVTec AD** is:
> Paul Bergmann, Michael Fauser, David Sattlegger, and Carsten Steger. *MVTec AD – A Comprehensive Real-World Dataset for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 9592–9600, 2019.

I will repeat this process for each dataset, ensuring that I capture the correct citation format as presented in the references.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This will ensure that I have accurately represented the datasets used in the research paper.
