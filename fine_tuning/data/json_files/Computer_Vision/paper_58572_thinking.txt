To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bayesian Non-parametric Hidden Markov Model for Agile Radar Pulse Sequences Streaming Analysis" by Jiadi Bao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly looking for any subsection that explicitly discusses datasets. In this paper, the authors mention that they demonstrate their framework on **diverse simulated radar signal data and real-life benchmark datasets**. This indicates that there are datasets involved, and I need to find their names and details.

In the **simulation design section**, the authors describe six simulation datasets (D1 to D6) used for parameter estimation (PE) and change point detection (CPD) tasks. They provide specific modulation types and parameters for each dataset, which is crucial information for dataset extraction. Here are the datasets identified:

1. **D1**: Agile Modulation with parameters WM = [100, 110, 120, 130, 140].
2. **D2**: Staggered Modulation with parameters WM = [100, 110, 120, 130, 140].
3. **D3**: Sliding Modulation with parameters WM = (100, 140, 5).
4. **D4**: Jittered Modulation with parameters WM = (125, 5).
5. **D5**: Dwell and Switch (D&S) Modulation with parameters WM1 = [100, 110, 115], WM2 = [60, 80, 100, 110].
6. **D6**: Mixed Modulation Types with various parameters.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the datasets are primarily simulation datasets created by the authors, so they may not have external citations. 

For the real-life benchmark datasets mentioned, I will look for specific references in the text. The authors mention two datasets:
- **HASC-2011 Dataset**: This dataset is referenced for human activity recognition and is cited as:
  > N. Kawaguchi et al., “Hasc2011corpus: towards the common ground of human activity recognition,” in Int. Conf. Ubiquitous Comput., 2011, pp. 571–572.

- **Well Log Dataset**: This dataset is referenced for nuclear magnetic resonance measurements and is cited as:
  > J. O. Ruanaidh et al., “Recursive bayesian location of a discontinuity in time series,” in IEEE Int. Conf. Acoust. Speech Signal Process., vol. 4, 1994, pp. IV–513.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations. 

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described, including its name, type, and citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
