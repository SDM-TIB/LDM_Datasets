To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SSD-6D: Making RGB-Based 3D Detection and 6D Pose Estimation Great Again" by Wadim Kehl et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on multiple challenging datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for any subsections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Evaluation Datasets."

Upon reviewing section 4, I find that the authors mention three datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Tejani Dataset**: This dataset consists of six sequences where each sequence requires the detection and pose estimation of multiple instances of the same object in clutter and with different levels of mild occlusion.

2. **LC-HF Dataset**: This dataset consists of 15 sequences where each frame presents one instance to detect, and the main challenge is the high amount of clutter in the scene.

3. **LineMOD Dataset**: This dataset is an extension of the LC-HF dataset, where one sequence has been annotated with instances of multiple objects undergoing heavy occlusions at times.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Tejani Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Tejani, D. Tang, R. Kouskouridas, and T.-k. Kim. *Latent-class hough forests for 3D object detection and pose estimation*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

- For the **LC-HF Dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Hinterstoisser, V. Lepetit, S. Ilic, S. Holzer, G. Bradsky, K. Konolige, and N. Navab. *Model Based Training, Detection and Pose Estimation of Texture-Less 3D Objects in Heavily Cluttered Scenes*. In Proceedings of the Asian Conference on Computer Vision (ACCV), 2012.

- For the **LineMOD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Hinterstoisser, C. Cagniart, S. Ilic, P. Sturm, N. Navab, P. Fua, and V. Lepetit. *Gradient Response Maps for Real-Time Detection of Textureless Objects*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2012.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details are captured accurately and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
