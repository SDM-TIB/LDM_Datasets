To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Shape-Texture Debiased Neural Network Training" by Yingwei Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets along with their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on several image recognition benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **ImageNet**: This dataset is a well-known benchmark for image classification, consisting of 1.2 million images for training and 50,000 for validation across 1,000 classes. The citation for ImageNet is:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, Alexander C. Berg, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 2015.

2. **PASCAL VOC 2012**: This dataset is used for semantic segmentation and includes 10,582 training images and 1,449 validation images across 20 object classes. The citation for PASCAL VOC 2012 is:
   > M. Everingham, L. Van Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2012 (VOC2012) Results*. 2012. Available at: http://www.pascal-network.org/challenges/VOC/voc2012/workshop/index.html.

Additionally, the authors mention other datasets used for evaluating generalization and robustness, such as **ImageNet-A**, **ImageNet-C**, and **Stylized-ImageNet**. However, these are variations or subsets of the original ImageNet dataset, so I will not include separate citations for them.

Now, I will check the **References section** to ensure I have the correct citations for the datasets mentioned. 

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
