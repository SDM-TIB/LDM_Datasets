To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Q&A of Clinical Documents with Large Language Models" by Ran Elgedawy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset section** (section 4) of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a conversational interface for exploring clinical notes, which suggests that datasets related to clinical documents are likely to be discussed.

In the **introduction**, the authors emphasize the challenges of extracting information from electronic health records (EHRs) and the need for intelligent systems. This context indicates that datasets used for training or evaluating their system may be included in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their research. Here, they mention two key datasets:

1. **MIMIC-IV**: This dataset encompasses information about over 40,000 patients admitted to intensive care units at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. It includes a wide range of data such as medications, laboratory measurements, observations, and clinical notes.

2. **MIMIC-IV-Note**: This dataset provides de-identified free-text clinical notes for patients included in the MIMIC-IV clinical database. It contains over 331,000 discharge summaries and more than 2 million radiology reports.

Both datasets are crucial for the authors' experiments and are referenced multiple times throughout the paper, confirming their significance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MIMIC-IV**, the citation is:
  > Alistair Johnson, Luca Bulgarelli, Tom Pollard, Steven Horng, Leo A. Celi, and Roger Mark. *MIMIC-IV (version 2.2)*. PhysioNet, 2023. URL: https://doi.org/10.13026/6mm1-ek67.

- For **MIMIC-IV-Note**, the citation is:
  > Alistair Johnson, Tom Pollard, Steven Horng, Leo A. Celi, and Roger Mark. *MIMIC-IV-Note: Deidentified free-text clinical notes*. PhysioNet, 2023. URL: https://doi.org/10.13026/1n74-ne17.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **MIMIC-IV**: A comprehensive dataset containing clinical data from over 40,000 ICU patients, including various medical records and observations.
2. **MIMIC-IV-Note**: A dataset of de-identified clinical notes, providing rich textual data for natural language processing tasks.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or analysis.
