To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph-Induced Syntactic-Semantic Spaces in Transformer-Based Variational AutoEncoders" by Yingji Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they perform empirical evaluations on "natural language sentences and mathematical expressions." This indicates that there are datasets related to these two types of data.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup and mention specific datasets used for training and evaluation.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that they utilize the following datasets:

1. **WorldTree Dataset**: This dataset is used for explanatory sentences and contains 11,430 examples with an average length of 8.65 tokens.

2. **EntailmentBank Dataset**: This dataset is also used for explanatory sentences, containing 5,134 examples with an average length of 10.35 tokens.

3. **Mathematical Expressions Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the work of Meadows et al. (2023) and contains 32,000 mathematical expressions with an average length of 6.84 tokens.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **WorldTree Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jansen, P., Wainwright, E., Marmorstein, S., & Morrison, C. T. (2018). *Worldtree: A corpus of explanation graphs for elementary science questions supporting multi-hop inference*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.03052.

- For the **EntailmentBank Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dalvi, B., Jansen, P., Tafjord, P., Xie, O., Smith, H., Pipatanangkura, L., & Clark, P. (2021). *EntailmentBank: A corpus for natural language inference with explanations*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2104.00780.

- For the **Mathematical Expressions Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Meadows, J., Valentino, M., Teney, D., & Freitas, A. (2023). *A symbolic framework for systematic evaluation of mathematical reasoning with transformers*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.12563.

With these citations, I now have the necessary information to describe each dataset accurately. I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.
