To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Geometric Brain Surface Network For Brain Cortical Parcellation" by Wen Zhang and Yalin Wang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating the model on a "large public dataset," which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors provide specific details about the dataset used. In section 3.1, they mention the dataset by name: **Mindboggle-101**. They describe it as containing a surface-based brain atlas that follows the Desikan-Killiany-Tourville protocol, and they provide additional details about the dataset, such as the number of subjects and the features measured.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Mindboggle-101 dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- For **Mindboggle-101**, the citation is:
  > Klein, A., & Tourville, J. (2012). 101 labeled brain images and a consistent human cortical labeling protocol. *Frontiers in neuroscience*, 6, 171.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Mindboggle-101**: This dataset contains a surface-based brain atlas with manually created labels for 32 sub-regions, evaluated on the left brain surfaces of 101 normal subjects. The dataset includes vertex-wise structural features such as cortical thickness, surface area, and curvature.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset details along with the full citation. This will ensure that the dataset extraction is complete and ready for further processing or review.
