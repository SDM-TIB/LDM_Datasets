To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Att-KGCN: Tourist Attractions Recommendation System by using Attention mechanism and Knowledge Graph Convolution Network" by Ahmad A. Mubarak et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that a knowledge graph dataset of tourist attractions based on tourism data from Socotra Island, Yemen, is used. This suggests that there is a specific dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methodology** sections. In the introduction, the authors mention collecting data on scenic spots and tourists' historical information from various websites, specifically noting that they constructed a knowledge graph with 1500 scenic spots, 2229 tourists, and 6091 score records. This provides a clear indication of the dataset's scope and content.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the construction of the knowledge graph and the interaction matrix between tourists and scenic spots. They mention that the dataset includes attributes such as address, score, level, tickets, travel type, travel time, and travel companions. This detailed description helps in understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **experimental setup section** where the authors provide statistics about the dataset, confirming the number of users, items, entities, relations, and knowledge graph triples. This quantitative information is crucial for a comprehensive dataset description.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset mentioned in the paper. The dataset is based on tourism data from Socotra Island, Yemen, and the authors have not provided a formal citation for it in the references. However, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Knowledge Graph Dataset of Tourist Attractions on Socotra Island, Yemen
- **Description**: This dataset includes information on 1500 scenic spots, 2229 tourists, and 6091 score records, with attributes such as address, score, level, tickets, travel type, travel time, and travel companions.
- **Source**: Collected from various websites and affiliated with the Yemeni Ministry of Tourism.

Since there is no formal citation provided for this dataset in the references, I will note that it is an original dataset created by the authors based on their research.

Finally, I will prepare to create an entry for this dataset using the specified format, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and completeness.
