To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KGroot: Enhancing Root Cause Analysis through Knowledge Graphs and Graph Convolutional Neural Networks" by Tingting Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that "comprehensive experiments are conducted on real and productive datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for validation. Here, they specifically mention two datasets:

1. **Dataset A**: This dataset consists of real-world failures from a bank system. The authors provide details such as the number of failures (99), the number of metrics (2594), and the number of failure classes (41).

2. **Dataset B**: This dataset is derived from an open-source microservice benchmark system called Train Ticket, which includes 156 artificially injected failures with 23 types. The authors also mention the metrics collected, such as CPU/memory stress and pod failures.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are described as originating from specific systems (a bank system and the Train Ticket benchmark), they may not have formal citations like published datasets. Instead, I will note the context in which they are used:

- **Dataset A**: Real-world failures from a bank system (no formal citation provided).
- **Dataset B**: Open-source microservice benchmark system "Train Ticket" (Zhou et al., 2018).

The citation for the Train Ticket benchmark is:
> Zhou, X., Peng, X., Xie, T., Sun, J., Ji, C., Li, W., Ding, D. (2018). *Fault analysis and debugging of microservice systems: Industrial survey, benchmark system, and empirical study*. IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the context and any relevant citations as needed. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
