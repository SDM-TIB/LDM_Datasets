To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RoomDreamer: Text-Driven 3D Indoor Scene Synthesis with Coherent Geometry and Texture" by Liangchen Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention datasets used for validation or experiments. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Implementation Details)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on the **ARKitScenes dataset**, which comprises real indoor scenes captured by an iPhone. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized.

I will then look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **experiments section** or throughout the paper. In this case, the ARKitScenes dataset is the primary dataset referenced for the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ARKitScenes dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

> Afshin Dehghan, Gilad Baruch, Zhuoyuan Chen, Yuri Feigin, Peter Fu, Thomas Gebauer, Daniel Kurz, Tal Dimry, Brandon Joffe, Arik Schwartz, and Elad Shulman. *ARKITSCENES: A Diverse Real-World Dataset for 3D Indoor Scene Understanding Using Mobile RGB-D Data*. In Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems Track on Datasets and Benchmarks 1, NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks 2021, December 2021, virtual, 2021.

With this information, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **ARKitScenes Dataset**: This dataset consists of real indoor scenes captured using mobile RGB-D data, specifically from an iPhone. It is designed to aid in the understanding of 3D indoor scenes.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the ARKitScenes dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant dataset information from the paper.
