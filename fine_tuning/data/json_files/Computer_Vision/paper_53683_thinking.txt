To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comprehensive Handwritten Paragraph Text Recognition System: LexiconNet" by Lalita Kumari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors report results on standard datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup and Results)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **IAM Dataset**: The IAM handwriting dataset is described as containing forms of handwritten text for training and testing text recognition experiments. The authors provide details about the dataset's segmentation and the number of characters.

2. **RIMES Dataset**: This dataset consists of handwritten letters sent to company administrators. The authors mention the training, validation, and test splits, which are crucial for understanding how the dataset is structured.

3. **READ-2016 Dataset**: This dataset is noted to be written in German and includes page, paragraph, and line-level segmentation. The authors also provide information about the dataset's splits.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **IAM Dataset**:
  > Marti, U.V., Bunke, H. (1999). *A full English sentence database for off-line handwriting recognition*. In Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), p. 705. IEEE Computer Society.

- For the **RIMES Dataset**:
  > Grosicki, E., El-Abed, H. (2011). *ICDAR 2011 - French handwriting recognition competition*. In 2011 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, pp. 1459–1463.

- For the **READ-2016 Dataset**:
  > Sánchez, J.A., Romero, V., Toselli, A.H., Vidal, E. (2016). *ICFHR2016 competition on handwritten text recognition on the READ dataset*. In 2016 15th International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition (ICFHR), pp. 630–635.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
