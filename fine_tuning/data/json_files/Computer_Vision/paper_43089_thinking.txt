To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Skill Rating as Fitness on the Evolution of GANs" by Victor Costa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and discusses challenges in training them, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction elaborates on GANs and their applications but still does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In **Section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, the authors explicitly mention the use of the **Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset** for their experiments. They describe it as a dataset composed of digits from 0 to 9 extracted from real house numbers, which adds complexity compared to other datasets like MNIST.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the SVHN dataset. The relevant citation is:
> Netzer, Y., Wang, T., Coates, A., Bissacco, A., Wu, B., & Ng, A.Y. (2011). *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. 

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the SVHN dataset is the only dataset used in this research.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. 

In summary, the steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section to identify specific datasets used.
3. Retrieve the full citation for the identified dataset from the references section.

With this information, I can now create the dataset entry for the SVHN dataset.
