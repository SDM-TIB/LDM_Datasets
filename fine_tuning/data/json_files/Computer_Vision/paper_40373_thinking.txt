To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LayoutVAE: Stochastic Scene Layout Generation From a Label Set" by Akash Abdu Jyothi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on **MNIST-Layouts** and **COCO 2017 Panoptic dataset**, indicating that these are the datasets used in their research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **MNIST-Layouts**: The authors describe this dataset as a synthetic dataset created by placing multiple MNIST digits on a 128×128 canvas based on predefined rules. It consists of 5000 training images and 1000 images each for validation and testing. This dataset is specifically designed for their experiments on scene layout generation.

2. **COCO 2017 Panoptic Dataset**: The authors mention using the COCO dataset, which contains images from complex everyday scenes with bounding box annotations. They specify that the dataset has 118,267 annotated images in the training set and 5000 in the validation set, with a total of 80 thing categories and 53 stuff categories.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MNIST-Layouts**, since it is a synthetic dataset created by the authors, it may not have a formal citation. However, I will note that it is based on the MNIST dataset, which is widely recognized. The original MNIST dataset citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- For **COCO 2017 Panoptic Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly:

1. **MNIST-Layouts**: A synthetic dataset created for the purpose of this research, based on the MNIST dataset.
   - Citation: 
     > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

2. **COCO 2017 Panoptic Dataset**: A dataset containing images from complex everyday scenes with bounding box annotations.
   - Citation: 
     > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
