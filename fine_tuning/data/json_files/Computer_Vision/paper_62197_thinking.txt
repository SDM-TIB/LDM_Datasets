To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A VAE Approach to Sample Multivariate Extremes" by Nicolas Lafon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors illustrate their approach on a **synthetic dataset** and a **real dataset of discharge measurements along the Danube river network**. This indicates that there are at least two datasets to look for.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for more details about these datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of generating accurate extremes and mentions the use of both synthetic and real datasets, confirming the presence of datasets.

I will then focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6), where the authors describe their experiments in detail. Here, they mention:

1. **Synthetic Data Set**: This dataset involves a 5-dimensional heavy-tailed random variable with a specific tail index. The authors provide a detailed description of how this dataset is generated, including the parameters used.

2. **Danube River Network Discharge Measurements**: This dataset consists of daily time series of river flow measurements over 50 years at five stations of the Danube river network. The authors provide a reference to the source of this dataset, which is crucial for citation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **appendices** for any additional details or references related to the datasets. The appendix A provides further information about the synthetic dataset and the Danube river dataset, confirming their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **synthetic dataset**, since it is generated by the authors, I will cite it as:
  > Lafon, N., Naveau, P., & Fablet, R. (2023). *A VAE Approach to Sample Multivariate Extremes*. Synthetic dataset generated for the study.

- For the **Danube River Network Discharge Measurements**, the citation is:
  > Bavarian Environmental Agency. (2023). *Danube River Network Discharge Measurements*. Available at: http://www.gkd.bayern.de.

Finally, I will ensure that I have captured all relevant details about each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used in the experiments. This will allow me to create a comprehensive summary of the datasets extracted from the paper.
