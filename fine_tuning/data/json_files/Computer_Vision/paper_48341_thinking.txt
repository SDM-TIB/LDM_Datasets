To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compressing Deep CNNs Using Basis Representation and Spectral Fine-Tuning" by Muhammad Tayab et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method on several well-known datasets for image classification and object detection, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR10**: A widely used dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.

2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes, containing 60,000 images as well.

3. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset used for image classification, containing millions of images across thousands of categories.

4. **MS-COCO**: A dataset for object detection, segmentation, and captioning, containing over 300,000 images with annotations.

I will then verify the details of these datasets in the **experiments section** to ensure that they are indeed the datasets used in the experiments. The authors confirm that they performed their experiments on these datasets, which solidifies their relevance.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet**:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

- For **MS-COCO**:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Sergio F. Gonzalez, et al. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help me create a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
