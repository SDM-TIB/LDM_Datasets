To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Masked Conditional Diffusion Model for Enhancing Deepfake Detection" by Tiewen Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses deepfake detection and mentions the use of data augmentation, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section IV (Experiment)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **FaceForensics++ (FF++) Dataset**: This dataset contains 1000 original videos from YouTube and corresponding fake videos generated by four deepfake methods. The authors specify that they use this dataset for training, validation, and testing.

2. **Celeb-DFv2 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 5639 high-quality deepfake videos generated using an improved synthesis process. It is used for cross-dataset testing.

3. **DeepFakeDetection (DFD) Dataset**: This dataset includes 363 authentic videos from YouTube and 3068 fabricated videos. It is also used for cross-dataset testing.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **FaceForensics++ Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Rossler, D. Cozzolino, L. Verdoliva, C. Riess, J. Thies, and M. Nießner. *Faceforensics++: Learning to detect manipulated facial images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, 2019, pp. 1–11.

- For the **Celeb-DFv2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. Li, X. Yang, P. Sun, H. Qi, and S. Lyu. *Celeb-df: A large-scale challenging dataset for deepfake forensics*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2020.

- For the **DeepFakeDetection Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Rössler, D. Cozzolino, L. Verdoliva, C. Riess, J. Thies, and M. Nießner. *Faceforensics: A large-scale video dataset for forgery detection in human faces*. Cornell University - arXiv, Mar 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
