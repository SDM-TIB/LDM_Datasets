To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Domain Adaptive Video Semantic Segmentation via Cross-Domain Moving Object Mixing" by Kyusik Cho et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved results on benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention three datasets: **VIPER**, **SYNTHIA-Seq**, and **Cityscapes-Seq**. I will note down the details provided about each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

1. **VIPER**: This dataset is described as a synthetic dataset generated from the game "Grand Theft Auto V," containing 134,000 video frames with corresponding segmentation labels.

2. **SYNTHIA-Seq**: Another synthetic dataset, it consists of 8,000 frames along with their segmentation labels.

3. **Cityscapes-Seq**: This dataset comprises 5,000 video clips captured from real streets, split into training, validation, and testing sets. The ground truth label is provided only for a single frame in each clip.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and should be formatted correctly.

- For **VIPER**, the citation is:
  > Stephan R. Richter, Zeeshan Hayder, and Vladlen Koltun. *Playing for benchmarks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 2213–2222, 2017.

- For **SYNTHIA-Seq**, the citation is:
  > German Ros, Laura Sellart, Joanna Materzynska, David Vazquez, and Antonio M. Lopez. *The SYNTHIA dataset: A large collection of synthetic images for semantic segmentation of urban scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3234–3243, 2016.

- For **Cityscapes-Seq**, the citation is:
  > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The Cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3213–3223, 2016.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
