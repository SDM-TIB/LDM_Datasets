To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MagFace: A Universal Representation for Face Recognition and Quality Assessment" by Qiang Meng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on face recognition, quality assessments, and clustering, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

Upon reviewing Section 4.1 (Datasets), I find that the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **MS1M-V2 Dataset**: This dataset contains 5.8 million images of 85,000 identities and is used for training. The authors note that it is a refined version of the original MS-Celeb-1M dataset, which had many noisy images.

2. **LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild)**: This dataset is used for evaluation and is known for studying face recognition in unconstrained environments.

3. **CFP-FP (Cross-Age LFW)**: Another evaluation dataset that focuses on face verification across different ages.

4. **AgeDB-30**: This dataset is also used for evaluation and contains images of faces across various ages.

5. **CALFW (Cross-Age LFW)**: This dataset is used for evaluating face recognition performance across different ages.

6. **CPLFW (Cross-Pose LFW)**: This dataset is used for evaluating face recognition performance across different poses.

7. **IJB-B and IJB-C**: These datasets contain images and videos for face recognition and are used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each of these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
