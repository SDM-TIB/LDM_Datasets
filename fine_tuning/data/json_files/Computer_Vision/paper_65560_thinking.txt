To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Preference Learning: Learning from Human Feedback without RL" by Joey Hejna et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research problem.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically detail the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of data).

In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments on the **MetaWorld robotics benchmark** and mention using **D4RL datasets** for evaluating their methods. I will note these datasets and any specific details provided about them.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. For instance, the MetaWorld benchmark is referenced, and I will need to find the corresponding citation.

The citations I will look for include:
- For the **MetaWorld Benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Tianhe Yu, Deirdre Quillen, Zhanpeng He, Ryan Julian, Karol Hausman, Chelsea Finn, and Sergey Levine. *Meta-world: A benchmark and evaluation for multi-task and meta reinforcement learning*. In Conference on Robot Learning, 2020.

- For the **D4RL datasets**, the citation is:
  > Justin Fu, Aviral Kumar, Ofir Nachum, George Tucker, and Sergey Levine. *D4RL: Datasets for deep data-driven reinforcement learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219, 2020.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

Finally, I will ensure that all dataset entries are accurately documented with their full citations, as this is essential for proper academic practice and to facilitate further research.
