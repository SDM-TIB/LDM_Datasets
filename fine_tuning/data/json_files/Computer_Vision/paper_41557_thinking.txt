To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Patch-level Neighborhood Interpolation: A General and Effective Graph-based Regularization Strategy" by Ke Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method in various experiments, which may imply the use of datasets, but I need to confirm their names and details in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is typically where datasets are explicitly mentioned. In this paper, the authors conduct extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. I will note these datasets as they are crucial for understanding the context of the experiments.

I will also check the **implementation details** within the experiments section to gather specific information about how these datasets were used, such as the number of labeled data points and any particular configurations or settings that were applied during the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For the datasets identified:
1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset is a well-known benchmark in machine learning, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The citation for CIFAR-10 is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 60,000 images but is divided into 100 classes, with 600 images per class. The citation for CIFAR-100 is the same as for CIFAR-10, as they are part of the same dataset collection.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately and comprehensively.
