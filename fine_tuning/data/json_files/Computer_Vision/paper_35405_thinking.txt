To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Altered Fingerprints: Detection and Localization" by Elham Tabassi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors used a database of **4,815 altered fingerprints from 270 subjects** and an equal number of rolled fingerprint images for their experiments. This suggests that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Altered Fingerprint Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. They describe the operational dataset of **4,815 altered fingerprints** and **4,815 valid rolled fingerprint images**. This section confirms the datasets' sizes and the context in which they were collected (from law enforcement agencies).

In this section, the authors also mention that the altered fingerprints were collected from **635 tenprint cards of 270 subjects**, which provides additional context about the dataset's composition. The paper states that the images are 8-bit grayscale and that a five-fold cross-validation was employed, which is relevant for understanding how the datasets were utilized in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, the datasets in this paper appear to be original datasets created or compiled by the authors, so I will focus on citing the paper itself as the source of these datasets.

The citation for the paper is:
> Elham Tabassi, Tarang Chugh, Debayan Deb, and Anil K. Jain. *Altered Fingerprints: Detection and Localization*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications, and Systems (BTAS), 2018.

Since the authors mention that the synthetically generated altered fingerprint dataset will be open-sourced, I will note that this dataset is also part of their contribution, but it does not have a formal citation yet.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the paper as the source of the datasets. This will provide a clear reference for anyone interested in accessing the datasets or understanding their context.
