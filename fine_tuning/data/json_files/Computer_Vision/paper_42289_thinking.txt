To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Thermal to Visible Face Recognition Using Deep Autoencoders" by Alperen Kantarcı and Hazım Kemal Ekenel, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their approach on three publicly available datasets: **Carl**, **UND-X1**, and **EURECOM**. This is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Datasets and Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **Carl Dataset**: This dataset contains 41 different subjects with paired LWIR and visible images, totaling 4920 images. The authors specify that they used half visible and half LWIR images, and they describe the training and testing setup.

2. **UND-X1 Collection**: This dataset includes 82 subjects with LWIR and visible paired images, and the authors outline the training and testing protocols they followed.

3. **EURECOM Dataset**: This dataset consists of images from 50 subjects with various facial variations and conditions. The authors also mention the number of images and the manual annotation of facial landmarks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For the **Carl Dataset**:
  > V. Espinosa-Duró, M. Faundez-Zanuy, J. Mekyska, and E. Monte-Moreno. "A criterion for analysis of different sensor combinations with an application to face biometrics." *Cognitive Computation*, vol. 2, no. 3, pp. 135–141, Sep 2010. [Online]. Available: https://doi.org/10.1007/s12559-010-9060-5

- For the **UND-X1 Collection**:
  > X. Chen, P. J. Flynn, and K. Bowyer. "Visible-light and infrared face recognition." In *Workshop on Multimodal User Authentication*, 2003, p. 48.

- For the **EURECOM Dataset**:
  > K. Mallat and J. Dugelay. "A benchmark database of visible and thermal paired face images across multiple variations." In *International Conference of the Biometrics Special Interest Group, BIOSIG 2018*, Darmstadt, Germany, September 2018, pp. 199 – 206.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
