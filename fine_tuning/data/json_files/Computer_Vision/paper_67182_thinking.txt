To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OpenVoice: Versatile Instant Voice Cloning" by Zengyi Qin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a "massive-speaker training set," which suggests that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find the specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges in instant voice cloning and mention the need for a "massive-speaker multi-lingual (MSML) dataset." This indicates that the MSML dataset is significant for their research.

In the **training section (Section 2.3)**, the authors provide details about the datasets used for training the base speaker TTS model and the tone color converter. They mention collecting audio samples from various speakers, which is crucial for understanding the datasets involved.

1. **Base Speaker TTS Model Dataset**: The authors collected audio samples from two English speakers (American and British accents), one Chinese speaker, and one Japanese speaker, totaling 30,000 sentences. However, they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, as it seems to be an internal collection.

2. **MSML Dataset**: The authors describe the MSML dataset as consisting of 300,000 audio samples from 20,000 individuals, with around 180,000 samples in English, 60,000 in Chinese, and 60,000 in Japanese. This dataset is crucial for training the tone color converter. Again, there is no formal citation provided for this dataset, as it appears to be a proprietary collection.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the datasets mentioned have associated citations. However, it seems that the datasets described (the internal collections for the base speaker TTS model and the MSML dataset) do not have formal citations in the references provided.

Since the authors do not provide specific citations for the datasets they collected, I will note that while the datasets are described, they lack formal references. This is important to highlight in my final output.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to note the lack of formal citations for the internal datasets while providing a clear description of each.

After compiling this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
