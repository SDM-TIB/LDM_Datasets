To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VI-Diff: Unpaired Visible-Infrared Translation Diffusion Model for Single Modality Labeled Visible-Infrared Person Re-identification" by Han Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of cross-modality data annotation and hints at the use of single-modality labeled data, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In this section, they state that they employ the **SYSU-MM01 dataset** for their experiments. This dataset is described as a benchmark for VI-ReID tasks, consisting of 491 individuals captured from six distinct non-overlapping view cameras, with a breakdown of visible and infrared images.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the **RegDB dataset** in the experiments section, which comprises 412 different individuals, each with 10 visible images and 10 infrared images. This dataset is used for further evaluation of their proposed method.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **SYSU-MM01 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ancong Wu, Wei-Shi Zheng, Hong-Xing Yu, Shaogang Gong, and Jianhuang Lai. *RGB-Infrared Cross-Modality Person Re-Identification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 5380â€“5389, 2017.

2. For the **RegDB dataset**, the citation is:
   > Dat Tien Nguyen, Hyung Gil Hong, Ki Wan Kim, and Kang Ryoung Park. *Person Recognition System Based on a Combination of Body Images from Visible Light and Thermal Cameras*. Sensors, 17(3):605, 2017.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the paper.
