To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VIMPAC: Video Pre-Training via Masked Token Prediction and Contrastive Learning" by Hao Tan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on several video understanding datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for pre-training and evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **HowTo100M**: This dataset is used for pre-training and consists of 1.2 million uncurated videos collected from YouTube, with an average duration of 6.5 minutes.

2. **SSV2**: This dataset is used for downstream evaluation and contains 168,913 training examples and 24,777 validation examples, focusing on action recognition.

3. **Diving48**: Another dataset for evaluation, which has 15,027 training examples and 1,970 validation examples.

4. **UCF101**: This dataset includes 9,537 training examples and 3,783 validation examples, focusing on human action recognition.

5. **HMDB51**: This dataset has 3,570 training examples and 1,530 validation examples, also for action recognition.

6. **Kinetics-400**: This dataset is mentioned as well, with 205,418 training examples and 17,686 validation examples.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **HowTo100M**, the citation is:

- For **SSV2**, the citation is:

- For **HMDB51**, the citation is:

  > Joao Carreira and Andrew Zisserman. *Quo vadis, action recognition? A new model and the kinetics dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 6299–6308, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
