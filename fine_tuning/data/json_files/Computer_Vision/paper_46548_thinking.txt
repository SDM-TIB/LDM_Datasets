To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Schemes of Propagation Models and Source Estimators for Rumor Source Detection in Online Social Networks: A Short Survey of a Decade of Research" by R. Jin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the evaluation section is likely to contain specific details about datasets used in the research.

In **section IV (Evaluation)**, the authors classify datasets into two main categories: **synthetic datasets** and **real-world datasets**. They mention that synthetic datasets are structured in terms of tree and graph networks, specifically citing **Random d-regular trees**, **Small-world (SW) networks**, and **scale-free networks** as examples. This indicates that these synthetic datasets are commonly used for modeling rumor propagation.

For **real-world datasets**, the authors mention three specific sources: **Facebook**, **Twitter**, and **Wiki-vote**, which are all freely accessible on the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection. Additionally, they reference **Sina Weibo**, a popular Chinese microblogging platform, as another real-world dataset relevant to their study.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, I will note the general sources where these datasets can be found:

1. **Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection**: This is a well-known repository for various real-world network datasets, including those from Facebook, Twitter, and Wiki-vote.

2. **Sina Weibo**: While the paper does not provide a specific citation, it is a widely recognized platform, and datasets from it can often be found in research related to social networks.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

- **Synthetic Datasets**:
  - Random d-regular trees
  - Small-world (SW) networks
  - Scale-free networks

- **Real-World Datasets**:
  - Facebook (Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection)
  - Twitter (Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection)
  - Wiki-vote (Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection)
  - Sina Weibo (general reference)

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset names and their respective sources, ensuring that I provide clear references for each dataset as required.
