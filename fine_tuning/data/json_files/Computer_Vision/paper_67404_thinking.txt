To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FAAC: Facial Animation Generation with Anchor Frame and Conditional Control for Superior Fidelity and Editability" by Linze Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the validation of the method on "multiple representative DreamBooth and LoRA models," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, particularly **section 4.1 (Experimental Detail)**, where the authors mention using "1000+ portrait videos as our dataset." This indicates that there is a dataset used for training, but I need to gather more details about it.

In this section, the authors describe the dataset as consisting of portrait videos, but they do not provide a specific name or citation. I will also check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited that could be relevant to the experiments.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors refer to several works, but they do not provide a specific citation for the "1000+ portrait videos" dataset. This dataset appears to be a custom dataset created for their experiments, and thus it may not have a formal citation.

Additionally, the authors mention using "DreamBooth" and "LoRA" models, which are techniques rather than datasets. However, I will note that the **CelebV-HQ dataset** is mentioned in reference [31], which is used as a benchmark for evaluating video quality. The citation for this dataset is:

> Hao Zhu, Wayne Wu, Wentao Zhu, Liming Jiang, Siwei Tang, Li Zhang, Ziwei Liu, and Chen Change Loy. *CelebV-HQ: A large-scale video facial attributes dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 8568â€“8577, 2022.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets:

1. **Custom Portrait Video Dataset**: This dataset consists of over 1000 portrait videos used for training the controllable modeling module and the motion module. However, it lacks a formal citation as it appears to be a custom dataset created by the authors.

2. **CelebV-HQ Dataset**: This dataset is used as a benchmark for evaluating the generated videos. The full citation is provided above.

In summary, I have identified one custom dataset without a formal citation and one benchmark dataset with a complete citation. I will now prepare to format this information according to the specified requirements.
