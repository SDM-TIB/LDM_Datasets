To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RPN: A Word Vector Level Data Augmentation Algorithm in Deep Learning for Language Understanding" by Zhengqing Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the RPN algorithm and its effectiveness across various NLU tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention several tasks and the corresponding datasets:

1. **TweetEval**: This dataset is used for multi-class tweet classification tasks. The authors note that it is presented in a unified format with fixed training, validation, and test splits.

2. **CoLA (Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability)**: This dataset consists of 10,657 sentences sourced from linguistic publications, with 9,594 sentences included in the public version for training and development.

3. **SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)**: This dataset includes 11,855 sentences extracted from movie reviews, annotated for sentiment analysis.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **TweetEval**, the citation is:

- For **CoLA**, the citation is:

- For **SST-2**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
