To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identifying and Disentangling Spurious Features in Pretrained Image Representations" by Rafayel Darbinyan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract references the **Waterbirds dataset**, which is a key dataset used in the study. This indicates that I should look for more details about this dataset in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Experimental Design)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the **Waterbirds dataset**. They explain that it is a benchmark dataset for classifying images of landbirds versus waterbirds, with specific details about its composition: it consists of bird photographs from the CUB dataset combined with backgrounds from the Places dataset. The dataset includes 4,795 training examples, 1,199 validation examples, and 5,794 testing examples.

In addition to the Waterbirds dataset, I will also look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors discuss the use of **bird masks**, which are generated using the Detic model for segmentation, but this does not constitute a separate dataset. Therefore, I will focus on the Waterbirds dataset as the primary dataset of interest.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Waterbirds dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Sagawa, S., Koh, P. W., Hashimoto, T. B., & Liang, P. (2020). Distributionally robust neural networks. In International Conference on Learning Representations.

This citation is crucial for proper attribution and should be included in the dataset description.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the findings for the Waterbirds dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry in a structured format, ready for any further processing or review.
