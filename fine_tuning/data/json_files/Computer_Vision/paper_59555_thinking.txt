To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion LMS for Distributed Estimation over Wireless Networks with Inter-Node Interference Perturbation" by Mohammadjavad Mirzazadeh Moallem and Mehdi Korki, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it may not contain specific dataset details. The introduction often discusses the context and previous work, which might include references to datasets used in related studies.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will specifically check for any mention of datasets used for simulations or evaluations of the proposed algorithms. If the authors describe any datasets, I will note their names, characteristics, and any relevant details provided.

If the paper does not explicitly list datasets, I will check the **references section** for any cited works that may include datasets. This is crucial because datasets are often introduced in the context of previous research, and the authors may rely on existing datasets for their experiments.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to gather the full citations for each dataset. This includes the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication. If a dataset is derived from a specific study, I will cite that study as the authoritative source.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset from a previous work, I will extract the citation in the following format:
- Author(s). *Title of the Paper*. In Proceedings of the Conference/Journal, pages, year.

After compiling the dataset names and their citations, I will organize this information clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for any required output format, ensuring that all information is complete and correctly attributed.
