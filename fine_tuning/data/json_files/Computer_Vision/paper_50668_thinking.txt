To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AutoDrone: Shortest Optimized Obstacle-Free Path Planning for Autonomous Drones" by Prithwish Jana and Debasish Jana, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a general overview of the research but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the concept of autonomous drones and their applications but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **methodology** section, where they describe the perception techniques and path-planning algorithms, but again, no datasets are mentioned.

Next, I will examine the **experimental results** section. Here, the authors present simulations on various grid sizes and obstacle configurations, but they do not refer to any specific datasets. Instead, they describe the experimental setup and results based on their simulations.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets used for training or evaluation, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through related works. However, the references primarily consist of papers discussing algorithms and methodologies rather than specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no datasets explicitly mentioned or utilized in the research. The authors focus on simulations and theoretical frameworks rather than empirical datasets.

In conclusion, since no datasets are identified in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for any datasets. Instead, I will summarize the findings and note that the research relies on simulations rather than external datasets for its experimental validation.
