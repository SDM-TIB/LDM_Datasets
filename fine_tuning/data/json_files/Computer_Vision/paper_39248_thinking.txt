To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimization of Inf-Convolution Regularized Nonconvex Composite Problems" by Emanuel Laude, Tao Wu, and Daniel Cremers, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Experiments," "Datasets," or "Methodology."** In this paper, I will focus on the sections that describe the experiments conducted, as they usually detail the datasets used for validation or testing.

Upon reviewing the paper, I will note any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial as it provides the necessary details for anyone who wants to access the datasets or understand their origins. I will ensure to extract the complete citation format, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "MNIST," I would look for its citation, which might be something like:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured and can be utilized effectively in future research or applications.
