To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Contextual Tag Embeddings for Cross-Modal Alignment of Audio and Tags" by Xavier Favory et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of audio representations in three different downstream tasks, which suggests that specific datasets are used for these tasks.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Evaluation)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three specific tasks and the corresponding datasets:

1. **UrbanSound8K Dataset**: This dataset is used for the Sound Event Recognition (SER) task. The authors note that it consists of around 8000 single-labeled sounds across 10 classes.

2. **GTZAN Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for the Music Genre Classification (MGC) task. The authors refer to a fault-filtered version of this dataset, which contains music excerpts of 30 seconds, split into training and testing sets.

3. **NSynth Dataset**: This dataset is employed for the Musical Instrument Classification (MIC) task. The authors mention that they sample a balanced set of 20,000 samples from the training set, which corresponds to approximately 7% of the original dataset.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **UrbanSound8K Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Salamon, C. Jacoby, and J. P. Bello. "A dataset and taxonomy for urban sound research." In Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Multimedia, 2014, pp. 1041–1044.

- For the **GTZAN Dataset**, the citation is:
  > G. Tzanetakis and P. Cook. "Musical genre classification of audio signals." IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing, vol. 10, no. 5, pp. 293–302, 2002.

- For the **NSynth Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Engel et al. "Neural audio synthesis of musical notes with wavenet autoencoders." In Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning-Volume 70, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
