To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An implementation of the 'Guess who?' game using CLIP" by Arnau Martí Sarri and Victor Rodriguez-Fernandez, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of CLIP for a game, but I need to look for specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss CLIP and its applications but do not mention datasets directly. I will proceed to the **methodology and experiments sections** where datasets are likely to be detailed.

In **section 3 (Game description)**, the authors mention that the images used in the game are taken from the **CelebA dataset**. They describe this dataset as containing 202,599 face images of 10,177 celebrities, each annotated with 40 binary labels indicating facial attributes. This is a clear identification of a dataset.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** to see if any other datasets are referenced. In **section 4 (Experiments and prompt analysis)**, the authors validate their methods using the **CelebA dataset** again, confirming its use in their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the CelebA dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). Deep learning face attributes in the wild. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) (pp. 3730–3738).

Since the CelebA dataset is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about it.

I will summarize the dataset details, including its name, description, and citation, ensuring that the citation is complete and correctly formatted. This will allow for proper referencing in any subsequent work or analysis.
