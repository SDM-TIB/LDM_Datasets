To extract datasets from the research paper titled "D-Net: Learning for Distinctive Point Clouds by Self-Attentive Point Searching and Learnable Feature Fusion" by Xinhai Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted extensive experiments on public datasets, specifically mentioning **ModelNet** and **ShapeNet part dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are likely important for the research.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their evaluation on **ModelNet40**, which consists of 12,311 CAD shapes across 40 categories, and **ShapeNet part dataset**, which includes 16,881 models from 16 shape categories with 50 part classes. This confirms that both datasets are used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **ModelNet**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Z., Song, S., Khosla, A., Yu, F., Zhang, L., Tang, X., Xiao, J. (2015). *3D ShapeNets: A deep representation for volumetric shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 1912–1920.

- For **ShapeNet part dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yi, L., Kim, V.G., Ceylan, D., Shen, I.C., Yan, M., Su, H., Guibas, L. (2016). *A scalable active framework for region annotation in 3D shape collections*. ACM Transactions on Graphics, 1–12.

With these citations, I can now summarize the datasets used in the paper:

1. **ModelNet**: A dataset containing 12,311 CAD shapes across 40 categories, used for shape classification tasks.
2. **ShapeNet part dataset**: A dataset consisting of 16,881 models from 16 shape categories, labeled in 50 part classes, used for shape part segmentation tasks.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
