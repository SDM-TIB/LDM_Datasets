To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AlignSDF: Pose-Aligned Signed Distance Fields for Hand-Object Reconstruction" by Zerui Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on the **ObMan** and **DexYCB** benchmarks, indicating that these are the datasets used for their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In **section 4.1 (Benchmarks)**, the authors provide descriptions of both datasets:

1. **ObMan**: This is a synthetic dataset that contains a wide range of objects and grasp types. It includes 87,190 samples for training and 6,285 samples for testing, with corresponding 3D meshes for hand-object interactions.

2. **DexYCB**: This dataset is noted as the largest real dataset for capturing hands and manipulated objects, containing 582,000 grasping frames for 20 YCB objects. The authors mention filtering frames based on the proximity of hand and object meshes, resulting in 148,415 training samples and 29,466 testing samples.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For **ObMan**, the citation is:
  > Hasson, Y., Varol, G., Tzionas, D., Kalevatykh, I., Black, M.J., Laptev, I., & Schmid, C. (2019). Learning joint reconstruction of hands and manipulated objects. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 8183-8192.

- For **DexYCB**, the citation is:
  > Chao, Y.W., Yang, W., Xiang, Y., Molchanov, P., Handa, A., Tremblay, J., Narang, Y.S., Van Wyk, K., Iqbal, U., Birchfield, S., et al. (2021). DexYCB: A benchmark for capturing hand grasping of objects. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 100-109.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **ObMan**: A synthetic dataset for hand-object interactions with 87,190 training samples and 6,285 testing samples.
   - Citation: Hasson et al. (2019). Learning joint reconstruction of hands and manipulated objects. In CVPR.

2. **DexYCB**: The largest real dataset for hand-object reconstruction with 582,000 grasping frames for 20 YCB objects.
   - Citation: Chao et al. (2021). DexYCB: A benchmark for capturing hand grasping of objects. In CVPR.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries for further processing or review.
