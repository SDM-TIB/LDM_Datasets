To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CausalScore: An Automatic Reference-Free Metric for Assessing Response Relevance in Open-Domain Dialogue Systems" by Tao Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected a new dialogue dataset called **CGDIALOG+** with human-annotated causal relations and pairwise human judgments. This is a clear indication that a dataset is present.

Next, I will look for specific details about the **CGDIALOG+ dataset** in the **methodology section**. Here, the authors describe that CGDIALOG+ is an extension of the CGDIALOG dataset, which contains a total of 2,444 history-response pairs across three domains, annotated with causal relations. They also mention that the dataset was constructed by adding 950 history-response pairs from the DREAM dataset.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if any other datasets are mentioned. The authors reference three dialogue datasets used for experiments: **ESConv**, **MSC**, and **DREAM**. 

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **CGDIALOG+**: The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset in the references, but they mention it is an extension of CGDIALOG. Therefore, I will cite the original CGDIALOG paper:
   > Feng, T., Qu, L., & Haffari, G. (2023). Less is more: Mitigate spurious correlations for open-domain dialogue response generation models by causal discovery. *Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics*, 11, 511-530.

2. **DREAM**: The citation for the DREAM dataset is:
   > Sun, K., Yu, D., Chen, J., Yu, D., Choi, Y., & Cardie, C. (2019). DREAM: A challenge dataset and models for dialogue-based reading comprehension. *Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics*, 7, 217-231.

3. **ESConv**: The citation for the ESConv dataset is:
   > Liu, S., Zheng, C., Demasi, O., Sabour, S., Li, Y., Yu, Z., Jiang, Y., & Huang, M. (2021). Towards emotional support dialog systems. In *Proceedings of the 59th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 11th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 1: Long Papers)*, 3469-3483.

4. **MSC**: The citation for the MSC dataset is:
   > Xu, J., Szlam, A., & Weston, J. (2022). Beyond goldfish memory: Long-term open-domain conversation. In *Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)*, 5180-5197.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets from the paper.
