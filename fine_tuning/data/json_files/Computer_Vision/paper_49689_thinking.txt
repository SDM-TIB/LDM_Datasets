To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convolutional Neural Networks Demystified: A Matched Filtering Perspective Based Tutorial" by Ljubiša Stanković and Danilo Mandic, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or applications** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the context of experiments or examples.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and results sections**. These sections often contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and testing the models. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the paper discusses specific experiments, I will check for any **figures or tables** that might summarize the datasets used. These visual aids often provide concise information about the datasets, including their sources and relevant statistics.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "ImageNet," I will look for the original citation, which might be something like:
> A. Krizhevsky, I. Sutskever, and G. E. Hinton. "ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks." In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 1097–1105, 2012.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing, making sure to include all relevant details for each dataset extracted from the paper.
