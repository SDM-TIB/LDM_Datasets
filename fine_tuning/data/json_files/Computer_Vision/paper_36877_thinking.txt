To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mode Regularized Generative Adversarial Networks" by Tong Che et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and mention various applications, but I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors describe their experimental setup and the datasets they utilized. They mention two primary datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is widely used for handwritten digit recognition and consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9). The authors perform various experiments on this dataset to evaluate their proposed methods.

2. **CelebA Dataset**: This dataset contains over 200,000 celebrity images with 40 attribute labels. It is commonly used for face attribute recognition and generative tasks. The authors use this dataset to test the effectiveness of their proposed regularizers on more complex data.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For the **CelebA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3730â€“3738, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
