To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatiotemporal Adaptive Neural Network for Long-term Forecasting of Financial Time Series" by Philippe Chatigny et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their model on two datasets covering 19 years of investment fund activities, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they summarize two datasets:

1. **D1 (Fasttrack)**: This dataset consists of 2,186 time points with 10 daily adjusted closing prices, covering the period from July 8, 1996, to August 22, 2007. It is noted that this dataset represents a low-data setting.

2. **D2 (Fasttrack Extended)**: This dataset contains 2,000 time points with 69 daily adjusted closing prices, spanning from May 31, 2011, to May 10, 2019. This dataset represents a medium-data setting.

The authors mention that both datasets were obtained through FastTrack, which is a crucial detail for citation purposes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are proprietary and obtained from FastTrack, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note that the datasets are sourced from FastTrack and provide the necessary details as described in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and the source (FastTrack) in a structured format for clarity.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and organized representation of the datasets used in the study, ready for further analysis or reporting.
