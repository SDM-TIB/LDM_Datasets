To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Electronic Conductivity Measurements in Solid Electrolytes Using an Ion Blocking Microelectrode: Noise Rejection Based on a Median Filter" by Veyis Gunes et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methodology and results, which may include references to specific datasets or materials used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and results sections** to find detailed descriptions of the experiments conducted. In particular, I will look for any specific materials or datasets that were used to measure electronic conductivity. The authors mention conducting measurements on **O2- ion conductors** and specifically refer to **Yttrium Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ)** as an example. This indicates that YSZ is a dataset of interest.

I will also check the **results section** for any additional datasets or materials that were tested, as well as any figures or tables that may summarize the data collected during the experiments. For instance, the authors discuss the electronic conductivities calculated from I-V curves, which may imply that there are datasets associated with these measurements.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the materials or datasets mentioned. For example, the authors reference several studies related to electronic conductivity measurements, which may provide authoritative sources for the datasets used.

The key datasets I will extract include:

1. **Yttrium Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ)**: This is a widely used electrolyte in the experiments, and I will look for its full citation in the references.

2. **LLTO (Lithium Lanthanum Titanium Oxide)**: This material is also mentioned in the context of electronic conductivity measurements, and I will ensure to find its citation.

3. **Other materials mentioned**: I will check for any additional materials or datasets referenced throughout the paper, particularly in the context of their experimental results.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the full citations for each dataset, ensuring that they are accurately represented according to the citation style used in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
