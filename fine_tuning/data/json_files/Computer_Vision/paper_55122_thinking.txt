To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Finding Point with Image: A Simple and Efficient Method for UAV Self-Localization" by Ming Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a paired dataset named **UL14**, which consists of UAV and satellite views. This is a clear indication that a dataset is present.

Next, I will look for more details about the **UL14 dataset** in the **dataset and evaluation section (Section IV)**. Here, the authors describe the characteristics of the UL14 dataset, including:

1. **Image Pairing**: The dataset contains paired training data of UAV images and satellite images.
2. **Multiple Flight Altitudes**: UAV images are sampled at three different altitudes (80, 90, and 100 meters).
3. **Multi-scale Test Data**: The test satellite data includes 12 different scales to enhance the difficulty of positioning.

The authors also mention that the UAV-view images were sourced from **DenseUAV** and the corresponding satellite images were collected from **Google Maps**.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For **DenseUAV**, the citation is:
  > Dai, M., Zhuang, J., & Zheng, E. (2022). Vision-based UAV localization system in denial environments. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2201.00001*.

- For **Google Maps**, while it is a widely used resource, it does not have a formal citation like a traditional dataset. However, it can be referenced as:
  > Google Maps. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://maps.google.com.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
