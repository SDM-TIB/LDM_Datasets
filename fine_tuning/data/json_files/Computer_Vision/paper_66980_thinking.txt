To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CSLP-AE: A Contrastive Split-Latent Permutation Autoencoder Framework for Zero-Shot Electroencephalography Signal Conversion" by Anders Vestergaard Nørskov et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on a standardized ERP dataset, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference the **ERP Core dataset** as a standardized ERP dataset containing data from 40 subjects across six different tasks. This is a clear identification of a dataset.

Next, I will look into the **methodology section**, where the authors provide more details about the datasets used. They mention that the ERP Core dataset includes data from various ERP components, such as N170, MMN, N2pc, N400, P3, and ERN, which further confirms the dataset's relevance.

The authors also mention using two additional datasets: the **EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset (EEGMMI)** and the **Sleep-EDF Expanded (SleepEDFx)** database. They describe the EEGMMI dataset as containing recordings from 109 subjects performing various motor imagery tasks and the SleepEDFx dataset as containing polysomnography studies from 78 subjects.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

1. **ERP Core Dataset**:
   > Kappenman, E. S., Farrens, J. L., Zhang, W., Stewart, A. X., & Luck, S. J. (2021). ERP CORE: An open resource for human event-related potential research. *NeuroImage*, 225, 117465.

2. **EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset (EEGMMI)**:
   > Lebedev, M. A., & Nicolelis, M. A. L. (2006). Brain–machine interfaces: past, present and future. *Trends in Neurosciences*, 29(9), 536-546.

3. **Sleep-EDF Expanded Dataset**:
   > Kemp, B., Zwinderman, A. H., Tuk, B., Kamphuisen, H. A., & Oberye, J. J. (2000). Analysis of a sleep-dependent neuronal feedback loop: the slow-wave microcontinuity of the EEG. *IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering*, 47(9), 1185-1194.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately for future reference or processing.
