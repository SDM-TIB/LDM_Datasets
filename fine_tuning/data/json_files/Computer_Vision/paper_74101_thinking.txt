To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MVGamba: Unify 3D Content Generation as State Space Sequence Modeling" by Xuanyu Yi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the integration of multi-view diffusion models with large-scale open-world 3D datasets, which suggests that there are specific datasets used in their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of dataset names.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, the authors mention that they obtained multi-view images from **Objaverse** for pre-training MVGamba. This indicates that Objaverse is a key dataset used in their research.

I will also check the **related work** section to see if any other datasets are referenced that might have been used in prior studies or comparisons. However, the focus will remain on the datasets directly utilized in the experiments of this paper.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. For **Objaverse**, the citation is:
> Matt Deitke, Dustin Schwenk, Jordi Salvador, Luca Weihs, Oscar Michel, Eli VanderBilt, Ludwig Schmidt, Kiana Ehsani, Aniruddha Kembhavi, and Ali Farhadi. *Objaverse: A universe of annotated 3D objects*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 13142â€“13153, 2023.

Now, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Objaverse**: This dataset is used for obtaining multi-view images for pre-training MVGamba. It is a large-scale dataset containing a variety of 3D objects.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
