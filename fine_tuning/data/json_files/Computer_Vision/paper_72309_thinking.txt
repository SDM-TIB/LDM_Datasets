To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing OOD Detection in Molecular Graphs: A Novel Approach with Diffusion Models" by Xu Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets," which indicates that multiple datasets are involved. I will need to find the specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two benchmarks: **DrugOOD** and **GOOD**. I will need to gather more details about these datasets.

In the **appendix** (A.1), the authors provide descriptions of the datasets. Here, I find the following details:

1. **DrugOOD**: This dataset is a systematic OOD dataset curator and benchmark for drug discovery, designed to cover a wide range of shifts that naturally occur in molecular graphs. It includes various properties for dividing ID and OOD samples, such as assay, molecular size, and molecular scaffold.

2. **GOOD**: This is another systematic graph OOD benchmark that provides carefully designed data environments for distribution shifts. It includes two kinds of shift strategies: covariate shift and concept shift.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The references may not directly cite the datasets but could reference the papers that introduced them.

For **DrugOOD**, the citation is:
> Yuanfeng Ji, Lu Zhang, Jiaxiang Wu, Bingzhe Wu, Lanqing Li, Long-Kai Huang, Tingyang Xu, Yu Rong, Jie Ren, Ding Xue, et al. *DrugOOD: Out-of-Distribution Dataset Curator and Benchmark for AI-Aided Drug Discovery – A Focus on Affinity Prediction Problems with Noise Annotations*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Vol. 37. 8023–8031, 2023.

For **GOOD**, the citation is:
> Shurui Gui, Xiner Li, Limei Wang, and Shuiwang Ji. *GOOD: A Graph Out-of-Distribution Benchmark*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35, 2059–2073, 2022.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach ensures that I capture all relevant details accurately.
