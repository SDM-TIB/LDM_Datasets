To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Utilizing Machine Learning and 3D Neuroimaging to Predict Hearing Loss: A Comparative Analysis of Dimensionality Reduction and Regression Techniques" by Trinath Sai Subhash Reddy Pittala et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the research involves predicting hearing loss thresholds using MRI images, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the correlation between brain morphology and hearing loss, hinting at the use of specific datasets related to MRI scans and auditory thresholds. However, I need to find explicit mentions of datasets.

The **methodology section** is crucial, particularly **section 3.1 (Data Acquisition)**, where the authors describe the primary dataset used for the project. They mention that the dataset consists of **171 gray matter images and 137 slices of human brain scans**, each labeled with corresponding hearing thresholds for 500 Hz and 4000 Hz frequencies. This is a clear identification of the dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, as it appears to be a custom dataset collected from clinical settings. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is derived from MRI scans and auditory threshold measurements but lacks a formal citation.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Dataset Name**: Custom MRI Dataset for Hearing Loss Prediction
   - **Description**: This dataset consists of 171 gray matter images and 137 slices of human brain scans obtained from MRI scans, each labeled with corresponding hearing thresholds for 500 Hz and 4000 Hz frequencies.

Since there is no formal citation for this dataset, I will note that it is a custom dataset used in the study without a specific reference.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that I highlight the lack of a formal citation for the dataset.
