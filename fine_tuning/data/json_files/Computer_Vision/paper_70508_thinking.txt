To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SDXL Finetuned with LoRA for Coloring Therapy: Generating Graphic Templates Inspired by United Arab Emirates Culture" by Abdulla Alfalasi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) model and mentions generating culturally significant coloring templates, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in this process.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. Here, the authors describe the fine-tuning of the SDXL model using images related to Al-Sadu weaving patterns and art therapy. They mention collecting around 10 high-quality images for the Al-Sadu pattern and approximately 80 images for the art therapy dataset. This indicates that these images form the basis of the datasets used in their experiments.

I will also check the **results section** to see if there are any additional details about the datasets or their characteristics. The authors highlight the effectiveness of the LoRA fine-tuning approach in generating images based on these datasets, but they do not provide specific names or citations for the datasets used.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for the datasets, I will need to create citations based on the context provided. The datasets are primarily composed of images related to Emirati cultural motifs and art therapy, but they do not reference any established datasets from previous research.

To summarize, the datasets I will extract from this paper are:

1. **Al-Sadu Weaving Pattern Dataset**: A collection of approximately 10 high-quality images representing Al-Sadu weaving patterns, used for fine-tuning the SDXL model.

2. **Art Therapy Dataset**: A collection of around 80 high-quality images related to art therapy, also used for fine-tuning the SDXL model.

Since these datasets are not formally cited in the references, I will note that they are original datasets created for the purpose of this research.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset names and descriptions, ensuring that I highlight the lack of formal citations while acknowledging their significance in the research.
