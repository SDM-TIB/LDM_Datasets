To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recalibrating 3D ConvNets with Project & Excite" by Anne-Marie Rickmann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental setup sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on two tasks: whole-brain segmentation of MRI scans and whole-body segmentation of CT scans. This indicates that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, specifically looking for any subsections that discuss datasets. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments in the **Experimental Setup** section.

1. **MALC Dataset**: The authors describe the Multi-Atlas Labelling Challenge (MALC) dataset, which consists of 30 T1 MRI volumes of the brain from different subjects. They mention that this dataset is used for training the model and provide details about the isotropic resolution and the cross-validation strategy.

2. **ADNI-29 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 29 scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, with a balanced distribution of Alzheimer’s Disease and control subjects. The authors note the challenges posed by the presence of pathology in segmentation tasks.

3. **CANDI Dataset**: The CANDI dataset includes 13 brain scans of children with psychiatric disorders. The authors mention that some scans have severe motion artifacts, which could affect the segmentation performance.

4. **Visceral Dataset**: For the whole-body segmentation task, the authors use the Visceral dataset, which consists of 20 annotated contrast-enhanced CT scans. They provide details about the voxel resolution and the number of organs segmented.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

- For the **MALC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Landman, B. A., & Warfield, S. K. (2012). *MICCAI 2012 Workshop on Multi-Atlas Labeling*. In Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention Conference.

- For the **ADNI Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **CANDI Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Visceral Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jimenez-del Toro, O., Müller, H., Krenn, M., Gruenberg, K., Taha, A. A., Winterstein, M., Eggel, I., Foncubierta-Rodríguez, A., Goksel, O., et al. (2016). *Cloud-based Evaluation of Anatomical Structure Segmentation and Landmark Detection Algorithms: Visceral Anatomy Benchmarks*. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 35(11), 2459-2475.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
