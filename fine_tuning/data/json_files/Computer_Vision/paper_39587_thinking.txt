To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Distance Metric Learned Collaborative Representation Classifier" by Tapabrata Chakraborti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark fine-grained classification datasets, which indicates that specific datasets are used.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly list three benchmark datasets:

1. **CUB-2011 Dataset**: This dataset contains 11,788 images of 200 bird species. The authors highlight the challenges posed by background variations and subtle inter-class differences.

2. **Oxford Flowers Dataset**: This dataset consists of 8,189 images of 102 flower species, with at least 40 images per class. It is noted that this dataset was developed by the Robotics Group at Oxford University.

3. **Oxford Pets Dataset**: This dataset includes 37 categories of pet cats and dogs, with around 200 images per class. It was compiled by the Oxford Robotics Group and IIIT Hyderabad.

To confirm the details and obtain the full citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **CUB-2011 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*. Technical Report CNS-TR-2011-001, California Institute of Technology.

- For the **Oxford Flowers Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nilsback, M.-E., & Zisserman, A. (2007). *Delving into the whorl of flower segmentation*. In Proceedings of the British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC).

- For the **Oxford Pets Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Parkhi, O. M., Vedaldi, A., Zisserman, A., & Jawahar, C. V. (2012). *Cats and Dogs*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its full citation. This structured approach will help in organizing the extracted data effectively for further use or analysis.
