To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Low-complexity and Low-overhead Receiver for OTFS via Large-scale Antenna Array" by Yaru Shan and Fanggang Wang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can hint at the types of data used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (if available) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation or testing. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, I will look for any references to datasets in the context of numerical results or simulations. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like the "Extended Vehicular A model," I will look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is part of a larger study or comes from a specific source, I will ensure to include that information.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate.
