To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TE141K: Artistic Text Benchmark for Text Effect Transfer" by Shuai Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors introduce a new dataset called **TE141K**, which contains 141,081 text effect/glyph pairs. This is a clear indication that a dataset is present.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (A Large-Scale Dataset for Text Effect Transfer)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the TE141K dataset. They describe the dataset's composition, including the number of styles, glyphs, and image pairs. The dataset is divided into three subsets based on glyph types:

1. **TE141K-E**: Contains 67 styles with 59,280 image pairs, focusing on English alphabets.
2. **TE141K-C**: Contains 65 styles with 54,405 image pairs, focusing on Chinese characters, English alphabets, and Arabic numerals.
3. **TE141K-S**: Contains 20 styles with 20,480 image pairs, focusing on special symbols and letters from various languages.

The authors also mention that approximately 87% of the images are used for training and 13% for testing across these subsets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The authors reference their own dataset, TE141K, but they also mention a previous work that used a smaller dataset, MC-GAN, which is relevant for comparison. However, since TE141K is the primary dataset introduced in this paper, I will focus on its citation.

The citation for the TE141K dataset is:
> Shuai Yang, Wenjing Wang, and Jiaying Liu. *TE141K: Artistic Text Benchmark for Text Effect Transfer*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2023.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for TE141K.

In summary, I have identified the TE141K dataset and its subsets, along with their respective details and the full citation. This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary information regarding the datasets mentioned in the paper.
