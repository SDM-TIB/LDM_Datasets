To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Infer Implicit Contexts in Real-time Online-to-Offline Recommendation" by Xichen Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on several real-world datasets, specifically naming **Yelp**, **Dianping**, and **Koubei**. This is a good starting point for identifying the datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets. In this section, they describe the three datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Yelp Dataset**: The paper mentions that the Yelp dataset contains users' review data and is publicly available. It is widely used for top-N recommendation evaluation, and the authors converted explicit review data to implicit feedback data.

2. **Dianping Dataset**: Similar to the Yelp dataset, the Dianping dataset contains customer review data and was processed in the same way to convert reviews into implicit feedback.

3. **Koubei Dataset**: This dataset is described as belonging to Alibaba's local service company and is used to predict user click-through rates (CTR) and conversion rates (CVR). The authors collected data over a period of 30 days for pre-training and used 14 days of customer logs for training and testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets, but I can infer the following based on common knowledge:

- For the **Yelp Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yelp Dataset Challenge. *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset.

- For the **Dianping Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dianping Dataset. *Dianping.com*. Available at: http://shichuan.org/HIN dataset.html.

- For the **Koubei Dataset**, since it is a proprietary dataset from Alibaba, a formal citation may not exist, but I can reference it as:
  > Koubei Dataset. *Koubei.com*, Alibaba's local service company.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
