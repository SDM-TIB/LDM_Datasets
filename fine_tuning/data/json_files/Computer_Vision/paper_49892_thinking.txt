To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodal Federated Learning on IoT Data" by Yuchen Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors empirically evaluate their framework on different modalities, including sensory data, depth camera videos, and RGB camera videos. This indicates that there are datasets involved, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention three human activity recognition (HAR) datasets:

1. **Opportunity (Opp) Dataset**: This dataset contains multimodal data measured by on-body sensors, including accelerometers and gyroscopes, and is used for recognizing various kitchen activities.

2. **mHealth Dataset**: This dataset includes data from multiple on-body sensors, such as accelerometers, ECG sensors, and gyroscopes, for daily living and exercise activities.

3. **UR Fall Detection Dataset**: This dataset consists of video clips recorded by RGB and depth cameras, along with accelerometer data, used for detecting human activities.

In the **results section**, the authors provide additional details about the datasets, including their modalities, sizes, and the number of classes. This information is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of each dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Opportunity Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **mHealth Dataset**, the citation is:
  > O. Banos, R. Garcia, J. A. Holgado-Terriza, M. Damas, H. Pomares, I. Rojas, A. Saez, and C. Villalonga. *mHealthDroid: A Novel Framework For Agile Development of Mobile Health Applications*. In Proceedings of the 6th International Work-Conference on Ambient Assisted Living and Daily Activities, 2014, pp. 91–98.

- For the **UR Fall Detection Dataset**, the citation is:
  > B. Kwolek and M. Kepski. *Human Fall Detection on Embedded Platform Using Depth Maps and Wireless Accelerometer*. Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine, vol. 117, no. 3, pp. 489–501, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its respective citation. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
