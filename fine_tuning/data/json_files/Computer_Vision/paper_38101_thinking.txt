To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalized Latent Variable Recovery for Generative Adversarial Networks" by Nicholas Egan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to delve deeper into the main body of the paper for specific dataset details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their applications, but they do not mention any datasets directly. I will proceed to the **experiments section**, which is likely to contain relevant information about the datasets used for training and evaluation.

In **section 4.1 (GAN Modeling and Results)**, the authors specify that they utilized the **Yelp dataset** for training their GAN model. They mention that they filtered images of food based on a label field in the dataset, resulting in 121,267 data points. This is a significant dataset for their experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Yelp dataset. However, since the Yelp dataset is a publicly available dataset, it may not have a formal citation in the same way as academic papers. Instead, I will note the source URL provided in the paper.

The relevant information I have gathered is as follows:

1. **Yelp Dataset**: This dataset contains images of food, filtered from the Yelp photos dataset. The authors mention that they used the photos.json file to extract relevant images.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the necessary citation details. Since the Yelp dataset is publicly available, I will include the URL as the citation.

After completing this process, I will have a structured entry for the dataset that can be used for further analysis or documentation.
