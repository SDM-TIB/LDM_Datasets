To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation for Wildfire Detection" by JooYoung Jang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a new dataset designed for wildfire detection, which suggests that there is a specific dataset to extract.

Next, I will look into **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors discuss the challenges of wildfire detection and mention the existing benchmark dataset, HPWREN. This section provides context for the new dataset they are proposing.

In **section 2.1 (Proposed Dataset)**, the authors detail their new dataset, which is a refined set of labels for the HPWREN dataset. They mention that the HPWREN dataset serves as a benchmark for wildfire detection but has limitations in terms of label diversity and quality. They propose a new labeling policy that increases label diversity by thirtyfold compared to the existing HPWREN dataset.

I will also check **section 3 (Results)** and **section 4 (Conclusion)** to confirm the significance of the proposed dataset and its performance compared to the original HPWREN dataset. The authors emphasize the improvements achieved with their new labeling approach.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **HPWREN Dataset**: The citation is:
   > HPWREN. The high performance wireless research and education network. http://hpwren.ucsd.edu/, 2000.

Since the authors are building upon the HPWREN dataset and proposing a new labeling policy, I will note that the original dataset citation is crucial for proper attribution.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citation for the HPWREN dataset. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the research.

After compiling this information, I will be ready to present the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
