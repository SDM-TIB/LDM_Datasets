To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Transferable Multi-modal Perception Representation Learning for Autonomy: NeRF-Supervised Masked AutoEncoder" by Xiaohao Xu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments" and "3D perception downstream tasks," which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the author typically describes the datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the paper mentions two specific datasets:

1. **nuScenes Dataset**: This is described as a large-scale dataset for 3D perception, containing six cameras and Lidar point clouds, with up to 1.4 million annotated 3D bounding boxes for 10 classes. The evaluation metrics used are detection score (NDS) and mean average precision (mAP).

2. **KITTI-3D Dataset**: This dataset is noted as one of the most widely-used benchmarks for 3D object detection, consisting of 7,481 and 7,518 image-Lidar pairs for training and testing, respectively. The evaluation metrics include 3D IoU (AP3D) and BEV IoU (APBEV).

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for their full citations:

- For the **nuScenes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H. Lang, and et al. *nuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. In CVPR, 2020.

- For the **KITTI-3D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In CVPR, 2012.

Now that I have the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
