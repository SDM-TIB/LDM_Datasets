To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PartSTAD: 2D-to-3D Part Segmentation Task Adaptation" by Hyunjin Kim and Minhyuk Sung, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on the **PartNet-Mobility dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely central to their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges of 3D segmentation and the limited availability of annotated 3D shapes, which reinforces the importance of the datasets they are using.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they used the **PartNet-Mobility dataset** for their evaluations. They describe the dataset as containing 45 object categories, with a specific training and testing split. This section provides valuable details about the dataset's structure and its relevance to their research.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **PartNet-Mobility dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Fanbo Xiang, Yuzhe Qin, Kaichun Mo, Yikuan Xia, Hao Zhu, Fangchen Liu, Minghua Liu, Hanxiao Jiang, Yifu Yuan, He Wang, Li Yi, Angel X. Chang, Leonidas J. Guibas, and Hao Su. *SAPIEN: A simulated part-based interactive environment*. In CVPR, 2020.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the **PartNet-Mobility dataset**, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. This will allow for easy reference and verification in future work.
