To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Contrastively Disentangled Sequential Variational Autoencoder" by Junwen Bai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and often mentions datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors indicate that they validate their method on four datasets from video and audio domains, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they explicitly list the datasets in **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, which is crucial for my extraction process. I will note the names of the datasets and any relevant details provided about them.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Sprites**: A cartoon character video dataset consisting of sequences where each character's motion can be categorized into three actions and three directions. Each sequence contains 8 frames of RGB images with a size of 64 × 64.

2. **MUG**: A facial expression video dataset where each individual performs six expressions. Each sequence contains 15 frames of RGB images with a size of 64 × 64.

3. **SM-MNIST**: A dataset that records the random movements of two digits, with each sequence containing 15 grayscale images of size 64 × 64.

4. **TIMIT**: A corpus of read speech for acoustic-phonetic studies, containing utterances produced by American speakers. The dataset is processed into segments of 200ms duration, treated as independent sequences.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with the sources for further exploration.

The full citations for the datasets are:

- **MUG**:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
