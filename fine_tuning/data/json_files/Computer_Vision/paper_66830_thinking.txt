To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cinematic Behavior Transfer via NeRF-based Differentiable Filming" by Xuekun Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context and significance of their work. They may reference datasets that are foundational to their research or that they compare their results against.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors describe their approach and may specify the datasets they used for training or evaluation. I will pay close attention to any details provided about the datasets, such as their size, type, and specific characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the **PHALP** for human pose tracking, I will look for the full citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Jathushan Rajasegaran, Georgios Pavlakos, Angjoo Kanazawa, and Jitendra Malik. *Tracking people by predicting 3D appearance, location & pose*. In CVPR, 2022.

Similarly, if they mention using **D-NeRF** for neural rendering, I will find its citation:
> Albert Pumarola, Enric Corona, Gerard Pons-Moll, and Francesc Moreno-Noguer. *D-nerf: Neural radiance fields for dynamic scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 10318â€“10327, 2021.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the paper, providing complete citations for each one.
