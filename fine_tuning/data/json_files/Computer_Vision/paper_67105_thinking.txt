To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DIFACE: CROSS-MODAL FACE RECOGNITION THROUGH CONTROLLED DIFFUSION" by Bowen Sun and Shibao Zheng, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the challenges of cross-modal face recognition and mentions the need for sufficient databases, which suggests that datasets may be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **Section 4.1.1 (Datasets)**, the authors mention using the **CelebA dataset** for evaluation, which contains 202,599 celebrity images annotated with 40 binary attributes. They also mention transforming some annotations into linguistic prompts and partitioning the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference a subset of the **WebFace** dataset for the pretrained face recognition encoder, and they mention other datasets like **AgeDB**, **LFW**, **CPLFW**, **CALFW**, and **CFP-FF/FP** used for ablation studies.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

After compiling this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for further processing or review.
