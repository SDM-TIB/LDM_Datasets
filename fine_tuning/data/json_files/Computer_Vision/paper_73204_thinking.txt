To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Capsule Network Projectors are Equivariant and Invariant Learners" by Miles Everett et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors demonstrate their method on the **3DIEBench dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is significant to their research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly in the **experimentation or results sections**. In this paper, the authors describe the **3DIEBench dataset** in detail in the **section titled "3DIEBench Dataset"**. Here, they provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset, including its purpose, structure, and the number of objects and classes it contains.

The **3DIEBench dataset** is described as follows:
- It consists of **52,472 3D objects** across **55 classes** sourced from ShapeNetCorev2. The dataset is designed to benchmark invariant and equivariant properties of deep learning models, providing images of these objects from **50 different views** along with the latent transformation parameters.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **3DIEBench dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Q. Garrido, L. Najman, and Y. Lecun. *Self-supervised learning of split invariant equivariant representations*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.10283, 2023.

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the dataset details and its citation clearly. 

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the **3DIEBench dataset** based on the information extracted, ensuring that the citation is included for proper attribution.
