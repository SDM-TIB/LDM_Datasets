To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transferring dense object detection models to event-based data" by Vincenz Mechler and Pavel Rojtberg, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the YOLO object detection model on event data, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of using event-based data and the need for datasets that can be converted from dense images. This indicates that they are likely using existing datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Dataset and Frame Representation)**, where the authors explicitly mention the **KITTI Vision dataset**. They describe it as a large collection of urban traffic scenes captured by cameras mounted on cars, with annotations for various object classes. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's purpose and content.

The authors also mention that they convert the KITTI dataset to events using a method referenced as vid2e. This confirms that the KITTI dataset is central to their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the KITTI Vision dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for Autonomous Driving? The KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite*. In Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2012.

Since the paper primarily discusses the KITTI dataset, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

After gathering all necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that the full citation is included for the KITTI dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
