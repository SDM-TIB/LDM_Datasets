To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LANCE: Efficient Low-Precision Quantized Winograd Convolution for Neural Networks" by Guangli Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors tested their method on "representative image classification datasets, including SVHN, CIFAR, and ImageNet." This indicates that these datasets are relevant to the research.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors mention using the following datasets:

1. **SVHN (Street View House Numbers)**: This dataset consists of over 600,000 digit images collected from house numbers in Google Street View images. It is commonly used for digit recognition tasks.

2. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is widely used for image classification tasks.

3. **ImageNet 2012**: This is a large-scale dataset containing over 1.2 million images across 1,000 classes. It is a benchmark for image classification and object detection tasks.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Wang Tao, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, and Andrew Y Ng. "Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning." Nips Workshop on Deep Learning & Unsupervised Feature Learning, pp. 1–9, 2011.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. "Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images." Computer Science Department, University of Toronto, Tech. Rep, vol. 1, pp. 1–60, 2009.

- For **ImageNet 2012**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, and Michael Bernstein. "Imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge." International Journal of Computer Vision, vol. 115, no. 3, pp. 211–252, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited for future reference. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research.
