To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PV-RCNN++: Semantical Point-Voxel Feature Interaction for 3D Object Detection" by Peng Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on the **KITTI dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely a primary focus of the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they used the **KITTI dataset** for their experiments. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of LiDAR point cloud frames collected for training and testing, as well as the division of the training dataset into training and validation splits.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the KITTI dataset. The citation provided in the paper is as follows:
> Geiger, A., Lenz, P., & Urtasun, R. (2012). Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite. In 2012 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (pp. 3354â€“3361). IEEE.

Since the paper primarily discusses the KITTI dataset, I will focus on this dataset for extraction. There are no other datasets mentioned in the paper, so I will compile the information I have gathered.

Now, I will create an entry for the KITTI dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing, containing the necessary details about the dataset used in the research.
