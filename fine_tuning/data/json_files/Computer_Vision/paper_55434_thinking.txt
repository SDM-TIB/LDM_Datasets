To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Task-wise Sampling Convolutions for Arbitrary Oriented Object Detection in Aerial Images" by Zhanchao Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of arbitrary-oriented object detection (AOOD) and mention that extensive experiments were conducted on several public datasets. This indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the part where the authors describe their experimental setup. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. The paper mentions several datasets, including:

1. **DOTAv1.0**: A widely used benchmark for evaluating AOOD methods, containing over 188,000 objects across 2,806 images.
2. **HRSC2016**: A ship detection dataset with 436 training images, 181 validation images, and 444 testing images.
3. **DIOR-R**: An aerial AOOD dataset with 190,288 objects across 23,463 images.
4. **DroneVehicle**: An infrared-RGB vehicle detection dataset with 17,900 image pairs for training and validation.
5. **SSDD+**: A synthetic aperture radar dataset for ship detection, containing 1,160 images.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **DOTAv1.0**:
  > G.-S. Xia et al., "DOTA: A large-scale dataset for object detection in aerial images," in Proc. IEEE/CVF Conf. Comput. Vis. Pattern Recognit., Salt Lake City, Utah, USA, June 2018, pp. 3974–3983.

- For **HRSC2016**:
  > Z. Liu et al., "A high resolution optical satellite image dataset for ship recognition and some new baselines," in Proc. Int. Conf. Pattern Recognit. Appl. Methods, vol. 2. SciTePress, 2017, pp. 324–331.

- For **DIOR-R**:
  > G. Cheng et al., "Anchor-free oriented proposal generator for object detection," IEEE Trans. Geosci. Remote Sens., vol. 60, pp. 1–11, 2022.

- For **DroneVehicle**:
  > Y. Sun et al., "Drone-based RGB-Infrared cross-modality vehicle detection via uncertainty-aware learning," IEEE Trans. Circuits Syst. Video Technol., 2022.

- For **SSDD+**:
  > J. Li et al., "Ship detection in SAR images based on an improved Faster R-CNN," in Proc. SAR Big Data Era: Model., Methods Appl., Beijing, China, Nov. 2017, pp. 1–6.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details are captured accurately and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
