To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AdaBrowse: Adaptive Video Browser for Efficient Continuous Sign Language Recognition" by Lianyu Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **four large-scale CSLR datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **PHOENIX14**: This dataset is described as containing 6,841 different sentences recorded from German TV weather forecasts, with a vocabulary size of 1,296. The dataset is split into training, development, and testing samples.

2. **PHOENIX14-T**: Similar to PHOENIX14, this dataset contains 8,247 sentences and has a vocabulary size of 1,085, also split into training, development, and testing samples.

3. **CSL-Daily**: This dataset revolves around daily life scenarios, recorded indoors by 10 signers, containing 20,654 sentences, with a division into training, development, and testing samples.

4. **CSL**: This dataset consists of 25,000 videos recorded in a laboratory setting by 15 signers, with a vocabulary size of 178 and 100 sentences, divided into training and testing sets.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this data into a structured format for further use or analysis.
