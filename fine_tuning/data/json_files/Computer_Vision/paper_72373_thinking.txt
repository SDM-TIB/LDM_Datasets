To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Editable Image Elements for Controllable Synthesis" by Jiteng Mu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset containing 3 million images filtered based on aesthetic and alignment scores. This indicates that a significant dataset is utilized in their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Dataset and Training Details)**, where the authors provide specific details about the dataset used. Here, they mention that their dataset consists of **3 million images from the LAION Dataset**, which has been filtered based on an aesthetic score above 6.25 and a text-to-image alignment score above 0.25. They also specify that they randomly selected 2.9 million images for training and held out 100,000 images for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the LAION dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **LAION Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Schuhmann, C., Beaumont, R., Vencu, R., Gordon, C., Wightman, R., Cherti, M., Coombes, T., Katta, A., Mullis, C., Wortsman, M., et al. *LAION-5B: An open large-scale dataset for training next generation image-text models*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35, 25278â€“25294, 2022.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the LAION dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
