To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Noise-Aware NeRFs for Burst-Denoising" by Naama Pearl et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) for burst denoising, but it does not specify any datasets. However, the introduction discusses the challenges of burst denoising and hints at the use of datasets for training and evaluation.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Method)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (A Simple Baseline)**, where the authors describe the creation of a new dataset called **LLFF-N**. This dataset is derived from the LLFF dataset and the NeRF dataset, with added noise to simulate realistic conditions. The authors explain how they generated this dataset, which is crucial for understanding its context and application.

In **section 5 (Results)**, the authors mention that they used the **LLFF-N dataset** for training and testing their model. This confirms that LLFF-N is the primary dataset utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **LLFF Dataset**: The citation for the original LLFF dataset is:
   > Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P Srinivasan, Rodrigo Ortiz-Cayon, Nima Khademi Kalantari, Ravi Ramamoorthi, Ren Ng, and Abhishek Kar. *Local light field fusion: Practical view synthesis with prescriptive sampling guidelines*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 38(4), 2019.

2. **NeRF Dataset**: The citation for the original NeRF dataset is:
   > Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P Srinivasan, Matthew Tancik, Jonathan T Barron, Ravi Ramamoorthi, and Ren Ng. *NeRF: Representing scenes as neural radiance fields for view synthesis*. In Proc. ECCV. Springer, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
