To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BIVA: A Very Deep Hierarchy of Latent Variables for Generative Modeling" by Lars MaalÃ¸e et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that BIVA is evaluated on various datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to extract. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they are used.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention several datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. The dataset is commonly used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

2. **CelebA**: A large-scale face attributes dataset with more than 200,000 celebrity images, each annotated with 40 attribute labels. This dataset is often used for tasks related to facial recognition and attribute prediction.

3. **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. It is widely used for training various image processing systems.

4. **FashionMNIST**: A dataset consisting of 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items, intended as a drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset.

5. **OMNIGLOT**: A dataset designed for one-shot learning, containing 1,623 different characters from 50 different alphabets, with 20 examples per character.

6. **BookCorpus**: A dataset consisting of over 11,000 books, used for training language models.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2010.

- For **CelebA**:

- For **OMNIGLOT**:
  > Lake, Brenden M., et al. *One-Shot Learning by Inverting a Compositional Causal Process*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2013.

- For **BookCorpus**:
  > Zhu, Y., Kiros, R., Zemel, R., Salakhutdinov, R., Urtasun, R., Torralba, A., and Fidler, S. *Aligning Books and Movies: Towards Story-like Visual Explanations by Watching Movies and Reading Books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2015.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented for future reference or analysis.
