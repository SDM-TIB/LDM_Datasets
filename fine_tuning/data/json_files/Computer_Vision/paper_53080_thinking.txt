To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Text-Conditional Image Generation with CLIP Latents" by Aditya Ramesh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of "large datasets of captioned images collected from the internet," which suggests that there are datasets involved, but I need to identify their specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **method section**, particularly where the authors describe their training dataset. They mention that their training dataset consists of pairs (x, y) of images and their corresponding captions. However, I need to look for specific dataset names or references to established datasets.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any mentions of datasets used for evaluation or comparison. The authors might refer to well-known datasets like MS-COCO, which is commonly used in text-to-image generation tasks. If they mention any specific datasets, I will take note of them.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors refer to the **MS-COCO dataset**, I will find the citation:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, Lubomir Bourdev, Ross Girshick, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, C. Lawrence Zitnick, and Piotr Doll√°r. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. arXiv:1405.0312, 2014.

If they mention any other datasets, I will follow the same process to extract their names and citations.

Once I have gathered all the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets from the paper along with their proper citations.
