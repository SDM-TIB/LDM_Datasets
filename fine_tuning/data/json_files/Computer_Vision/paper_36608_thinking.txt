To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cognitive Psychology for Deep Neural Networks: A Shape Bias Case Study" by Samuel Ritter et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss the methodology and experiments** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used datasets inspired by cognitive psychology experiments, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Data for bias discovery)**, as it is likely to contain the most relevant information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I find two datasets explicitly mentioned:

1. **Cognitive Psychology Probe Data (CogPsyc data)**: This dataset consists of 150 images of objects arranged in triples (probe image, shape-match image, and color-match image). The images were provided by cognitive psychologist Linda Smith and are used to test the shape bias in DNNs.

2. **Probe Data from the wild**: This dataset includes 90 images of objects collected using Google Image Search, also arranged in triples. The authors created this dataset to test the shape bias in a real-world context.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. The paper mentions that the CogPsyc dataset was provided by Linda Smith, but it does not provide a formal citation. However, I can note that it is available online at a specified URL, which I will include in the dataset description.

For the second dataset, since it is a collection of images sourced from Google Image Search, it does not have a formal citation either, but I will describe it in the dataset entry.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Cognitive Psychology Probe Data (CogPsyc data)**:
   - Description: A dataset consisting of 150 images of objects arranged in triples (probe image, shape-match image, and color-match image). The images were provided by Linda Smith and are used to test the shape bias in DNNs.
   - Citation: Available at http://www.indiana.edu/~cogdev/SB_testsets.html

2. **Probe Data from the wild**:
   - Description: A dataset of 90 images of objects collected using Google Image Search, arranged in triples to test the shape bias in a real-world context.

With this information compiled, I will prepare to format the dataset entries according to the specified structure, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
