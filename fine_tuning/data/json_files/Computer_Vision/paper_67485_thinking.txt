To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Spatially-Continuous Fiber Orientation Functions" by Tyler Spears and P. Thomas Fletcher, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of an "expanded simulated dataset built for evaluating deep-learning tractography models." This indicates that there is at least one dataset that is explicitly mentioned.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to gather more details about the datasets used. In **Experiment 1**, the authors refer to the **HCP Young Adult dataset** for voxel-wise ODF reconstruction. This dataset is crucial for understanding their evaluation metrics and methods.

In **Experiment 3**, the authors discuss the **ISMRM-2015 tractography challenge dataset**, which they have extended from one to 15 brain-like simulacrums. This indicates that they have created a new dataset based on the original challenge dataset, which is also important for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **HCP Young Adult dataset**, the citation is:
   > David C. Van Essen, Stephen M. Smith, Deanna M. Barch, Timothy E. J. Behrens, Essa Yacoub, and Kamil Ugurbil. *The WU-Minn Human Connectome Project: An overview*. NeuroImage, vol. 80, pp. 62–79, Oct. 2013.

2. For the **ISMRM-2015 tractography challenge dataset**, the citation is:
   > Emmanuelle Renauld, Antoine Théberge, Laurent Petit, Jean-Christophe Houde, and Maxime Descoteaux. *Validate your white matter tractography algorithms with a reappraised ISMRM 2015 Tractography Challenge scoring system*. Sci Rep, vol. 13, no. 1, pp. 1–11, Feb. 2023.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **HCP Young Adult dataset**: Used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method in voxel-wise ODF reconstruction.
- **ISMRM-2015 tractography challenge dataset**: Extended to include 15 brain-like simulacrums for training and testing purposes in tractography.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that all information is accurately represented for future reference or processing.
