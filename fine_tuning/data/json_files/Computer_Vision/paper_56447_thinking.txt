To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bootstrapping meaning through listening: Unsupervised learning of spoken sentence embeddings" by Jian Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract indicates that the authors created a dataset for evaluating spoken sentence similarities, which suggests that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will examine the **data section** (Section 4) in detail, as it is likely to contain explicit descriptions of the datasets used in the study. In this section, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Common Voice Spoken Sentence Similarity (CVS)**: This dataset is based on the test set of the English subset of Common Voice. It contains 1149 sentence pairs rated by multiple human raters for similarity. The authors provide details about the annotation process and the distribution of similarity scores.

2. **Spoken STS**: This dataset includes synthetic and natural recordings of sentences from the Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) dataset. It covers benchmarks from STS12 to STS16 and contains paired sentences with human-labeled similarity scores.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Common Voice Spoken Sentence Similarity (CVS)** dataset, the citation is:
> Ardila, R., Branson, M., Davis, K., Kohler, M., Meyer, J., Henretty, M., Morais, R., Saunders, L., Tyers, F., & Weber, G. (2020). Common voice: A massively multilingual speech corpus. In Proceedings of the 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC), pages 4218–4222, Marseille, France. European Language Resources Association.

For the **Spoken STS** dataset, the citation is:
> Merkx, D., Frank, S. L., & Ernestus, M. (2021). Semantic Sentence Similarity: Size does not Always Matter. In Proceedings of Interspeech 2021, pages 4393–4397.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the extraction is thorough and ready for any further processing or review.
