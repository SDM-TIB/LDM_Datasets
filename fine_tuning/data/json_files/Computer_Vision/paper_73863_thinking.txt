To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncertainty of Joint Neural Contextual Bandit" by Hongbo Guo and Zheqing Zhu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of real industrial data for experiments, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Experiment Set Up and Results)**, as this section typically contains details about the datasets used in experiments. Here, the authors mention that they conducted experiments with "real industrial data," but I need to find out if they specify the exact datasets used.

I will also look for any **figures or tables** that might provide additional context or details about the datasets. If the authors refer to specific datasets in the context of their experiments, I will note those down.

After identifying any datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If the paper does not provide specific dataset names, I will note that as well, indicating that the authors used "real industrial data" without specifying the datasets.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
