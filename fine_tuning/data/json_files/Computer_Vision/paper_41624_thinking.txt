To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "AdaCare: Explainable Clinical Health Status Representation Learning via Scale-Adaptive Feature Extraction and Recalibration" by Liantao Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **two real-world datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention:

1. **MIMIC-III Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database, which contains ICU data. The authors specify that they used this dataset for decompensation prediction, detailing the number of patients and records involved.

2. **End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Dataset**: This dataset consists of records from end-stage renal disease patients who received therapy from a specific time frame. The authors provide information about the number of patients and records, as well as the features included in the dataset.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations I find are:

- For the **MIMIC-III Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Johnson, A. E.; Pollard, T. J.; Shen, L.; Li-wei, H. L.; Feng, M.; Ghassemi, M.; Moody, B.; Szolovits, P.; Celi, L. A.; and Mark, R. G. 2016. *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific Data 3:160035.

- For the **ESRD Dataset**, while the paper does not provide a formal citation, it refers to the dataset as being collected from a real-world hospital, and it is implied that the authors have compiled this dataset based on their own research.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the MIMIC-III dataset and a description for the ESRD dataset, which will be noted as a real-world dataset without a formal citation.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
