To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid Energy Based Model in the Feature Space for Out-of-Distribution Detection" by Marc Lafon et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the HEAT model sets new state-of-the-art results on the **CIFAR-10 / CIFAR-100 benchmark** and the **large-scale Imagenet benchmark**, indicating that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for validation. They mention using **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** as in-distribution datasets. Additionally, they refer to several out-of-distribution datasets, categorized into near-OOD, mid-OOD, and far-OOD datasets. The specific datasets mentioned include:

1. **TinyImagenet**: Used as a near-OOD dataset for CIFAR-10.
2. **LSUN**: Used as a mid-OOD dataset for both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.
3. **Places**: Another mid-OOD dataset for both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.
4. **Textures**: Used as a far-OOD dataset for both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.
5. **SVHN**: Also a far-OOD dataset for both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.
6. **Imagenet**: Mentioned as a benchmark for OOD detection.

In the **References section**, I will find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations into a structured format for further processing.
