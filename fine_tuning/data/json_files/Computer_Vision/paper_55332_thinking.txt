To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AutoQML: Automatic Generation and Training of Robust Quantum-Inspired Classifiers by Using Genetic Algorithms on Grayscale Images" by Sergio Altares-LÃ³pez et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Use Cases)**, where the authors describe the datasets utilized in their experiments. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **COVID-19 Dataset**: This dataset includes X-ray images of lungs from patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and healthy patients, comprising a total of 227 images. The authors indicate that they implemented a supervised algorithm to identify the classes within this dataset.

2. **Brain Tumor Dataset**: This dataset consists of 253 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images, some displaying brain tumors and others showing healthy brain structures. The goal is to identify abnormalities in the brain structures.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **COVID-19 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Raikote. *COVID-19 Image Dataset*. Available: https://www.kaggle.com/pranavraikokte/covid19-image-dataset/metadata, 2020.

- For the **Brain Tumor Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Navoneel Chakrabarty. *Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection*. Available: https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection/metadata, April 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
