To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards improving discriminative reconstruction via simultaneous dense and sparse coding" by Abiy Tasissa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work. I will look for any references to datasets used for validation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) since this section usually contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. I will read through the subsections carefully to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described.

In Section 4.1, the authors discuss **phase transition curves** and mention generating data for their experiments. I will look for specific dataset names or references to datasets used in these experiments. If the authors describe the datasets in detail, I will note down the characteristics, such as the number of samples, types of data, and any relevant annotations.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for any papers or sources that are cited in relation to the datasets.

If the datasets are not directly cited in the references, I will note any relevant information provided in the text that could help in locating the datasets, such as authors, titles, or publication venues.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
