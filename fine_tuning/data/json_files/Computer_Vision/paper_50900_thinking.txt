To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepGuard: A Framework for Safeguarding Autonomous Driving Systems from Inconsistent Behaviours" by Manzoor Hussain et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the performance of DeepGuard using "open-sourced DNN-based ADSs in the Udacity simulator," which indicates that the Udacity simulator is a key component of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the **experimental evaluation** section, the authors describe the datasets collected under nominal driving conditions, specifically mentioning a dataset of **120,624 training images** collected from three different tracks: Track 1 (Lake), Track 2 (Jungle), and Track 3 (Mountain). This is a clear indication of a dataset that I need to document.

I will also check for any additional datasets mentioned in the **evaluation** section. The authors discuss the evaluation dataset, which consists of **650,866 images** collected from the same three tracks under various conditions (e.g., rain, fog, day/night cycle). This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of the DeepGuard system.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The Udacity simulator is referenced multiple times, and I need to ensure I capture its citation correctly. The relevant citation for the Udacity simulator is:
> Udacity. *A self-driving car simulator built with Unity*. https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim. (Accessed May 16, 2021).

Additionally, I will note the specific datasets mentioned:
1. **Training Dataset**: 120,624 images collected from three tracks (Lake, Jungle, Mountain).
2. **Evaluation Dataset**: 650,866 images collected from the same three tracks under various conditions.

For the training dataset, I will provide a citation that reflects the source of the data collection, which is the Udacity simulator.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its respective citation.

After completing this process, I will have a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the paper and their citations, ready for further processing or review.
