To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast One-Stage Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Person Search" by Tianxiang Cui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** section, particularly in **section 3.1 (Datasets and Evaluation metrics)**. Here, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for evaluation:

1. **CUHK-SYSU**: This dataset consists of 12,490 images captured by real surveillance cameras and 5,694 images from movies and TV shows. The training set includes 11,206 images and 5,532 query persons, while the test set comprises 6,978 images and 2,900 query persons.

2. **PRW**: This dataset contains a total of 11,816 video frames captured by 6 cameras and includes 2,057 queries with 932 identities.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For **CUHK-SYSU**, the citation is:
  > Xiao, T., Li, S., Wang, B., Lin, L., & Wang, X. (2017). Joint detection and identification feature learning for person search. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (CVPR), pages 3415–3424.

- For **PRW**, the citation is:
  > Zheng, L., Zhang, Z., Sun, S., Chandraker, M., Yang, Y., & Tian, Q. (2017). Person re-identification in the wild. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (CVPR), pages 1367–1376.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **CUHK-SYSU**: A dataset with 12,490 images from surveillance and movies, used for person search.
   - Citation: Xiao, T., Li, S., Wang, B., Lin, L., & Wang, X. (2017). Joint detection and identification feature learning for person search. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (CVPR), pages 3415–3424.

2. **PRW**: A dataset with 11,816 video frames from multiple cameras, used for person re-identification.
   - Citation: Zheng, L., Zhang, Z., Sun, S., Chandraker, M., Yang, Y., & Tian, Q. (2017). Person re-identification in the wild. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (CVPR), pages 1367–1376.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
