To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differentially Private Sampling from Rashomon Sets, and the Universality of Langevin Diffusion for Convex Optimization" by Arun Ganesh, Abhradeep Thakurta, and Jalaj Upadhyay, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology."** In this paper, I will focus on the **"Sampling from Rashomon Sets"** section and any related experiments that might mention datasets.

As I read through these sections, I will take note of any datasets explicitly mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the **"Penn Action Dataset,"** I will look for its citation in the references. The citation format typically includes the authors, title, conference or journal name, and publication year.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation for each dataset as part of the description. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring clarity and completeness for anyone reviewing the datasets extracted from the paper.
