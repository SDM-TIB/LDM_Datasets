To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking Client Drift in Federated Learning: A Logit Perspective" by Yunlu Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting extensive experiments on three typical FL datasets: **CIFAR-100**, **FEMNIST**, and **Office-Caltech-10**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial to the research and should be documented.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to gather more details about how these datasets were utilized. The authors describe the datasets and their characteristics, including the specific non-IID settings they were tested under, such as label skew and feature skew. This information is essential for understanding the context in which the datasets were used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a summary of the datasets:
1. **CIFAR-100**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 100 classes, with 600 images per class. It is commonly used for image classification tasks.
2. **FEMNIST**: A dataset derived from the MNIST dataset, consisting of handwritten digits and letters, specifically designed for federated learning scenarios.
3. **Office-Caltech-10**: A dataset that includes images from 10 different categories, used to evaluate domain adaptation and transfer learning.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets easily.

The full citations I will extract are:
- For **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. "Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images." 2009.

- For **FEMNIST**:
  > Caldas, S., Duddu, S. M. K., Wu, P., Li, T., Konečný, J., McMahan, H. B., Smith, V., & Talwalkar, A. "Leaf: A Benchmark for Federated Settings." arXiv preprint arXiv:1812.01097, 2018.

- For **Office-Caltech-10**:
  > Gong, B., Shi, Y., Sha, F., & Grauman, K. "Geodesic Flow Kernel for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation." In 2012 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2066-2073, 2012.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
