To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MobileNeRF: Exploiting the Polygon Rasterization Pipeline for Efficient Neural Field Rendering on Mobile Architectures" by Zhiqin Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but I will need to look deeper for specific dataset references.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of rendering Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and mention that their method is evaluated on various datasets. This indicates that datasets are likely to be detailed in the experiments section.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Synthetic 360° Scenes**: This dataset consists of 8 synthetic scenes used to evaluate the performance of MobileNeRF. The paper does not provide a detailed citation for this dataset, but it is referenced in the context of NeRF.

2. **Forward-Facing Scenes**: This dataset includes 8 forward-facing scenes from the LLFF dataset, which is commonly used for evaluating view synthesis methods. The authors do not provide a specific citation in the paper, but I will need to look it up.

3. **Unbounded 360° Outdoor Scenes**: This dataset is derived from the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset, which consists of 5 unbounded outdoor scenes. Again, the paper does not provide a citation, so I will need to find it.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **LLFF dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mildenhall, B., Srinivasan, P. P., Ortiz-Cayon, R., Kalantari, N. K., Ramamoorthi, R., Ng, R., & Kar, A. (2019). Local light field fusion: Practical view synthesis with prescriptive sampling guidelines. *ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG)*, 38(4), 1-12.

- For the **Mip-NeRF 360 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Barron, J. T., Mildenhall, B., Verbin, D., Srinivasan, P. P., & Hedman, P. (2022). Mip-nerf 360: Unbounded anti-aliased neural radiance fields. *CVPR*.

The **Synthetic 360° Scenes** dataset does not have a specific citation as it is a collection of synthetic scenes generated for the purpose of this research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that all datasets are accurately represented and properly cited.
