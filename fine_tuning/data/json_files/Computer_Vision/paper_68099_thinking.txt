To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PULASki: Learning inter-rater variability using statistical distances to improve probabilistic segmentation" by Soumick Chatterjee et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for validation. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Labels)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **StudyForrest Dataset**: This dataset contains 20 subjects and includes 7T MRA-ToF full brain volumetric images with a matrix size of [480 × 640 × 163] in NIFTI format. The authors note that multiple plausible segmentations were generated using the Frangi filter due to the lack of manual labels.

2. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Segmentation Dataset**: This dataset was used for the MICCAI 2016 challenge and contains MRI scans of 53 patients with corresponding manual segmentations of lesions by seven experts. The authors discuss the variability in expert annotations and the inter-rater agreement.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **StudyForrest Dataset**, the citation is:
> O. Commowick, M. Kain, R. Casey, R. Ameli, J.-C. Ferré, A. Kerbrat, T. Tourdias, F. Cervenansky, S. Camarasu-Pop, T. Glatard, et al. *Multiple sclerosis lesions segmentation from multiple experts: The MICCAI 2016 challenge dataset*. Neuroimage, 244, 2021.

For the **Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Segmentation Dataset**, the citation is:
> O. Commowick, M. Kain, R. Casey, R. Ameli, J.-C. Ferré, A. Kerbrat, T. Tourdias, F. Cervenansky, S. Camarasu-Pop, T. Glatard, et al. *Multiple sclerosis lesions segmentation from multiple experts: The MICCAI 2016 challenge dataset*. Neuroimage, 244, 2021.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research.
