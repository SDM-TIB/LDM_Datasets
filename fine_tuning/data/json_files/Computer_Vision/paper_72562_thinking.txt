To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Active Subspaces to Capture Epistemic Model Uncertainty in Deep Generative Models for Molecular Design" by Abeer Nafiz et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to data used in experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of generative models in molecular design and may reference datasets used in previous works. I will pay attention to any citations that might indicate the datasets they are building upon or using for their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly any subsections that detail the experiments or data collection processes. This section often contains specific information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their descriptions and any relevant details.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors discuss the datasets in the context of their findings. They may provide insights into how the datasets influenced their results or any comparisons made using different datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For this paper, I anticipate that the authors might reference datasets such as:

1. **Training dataset for JT-VAE**: The authors mention using a training dataset for the Junction Tree Variational Autoencoder (JT-VAE). I will look for the specific dataset name and citation.

2. **Validation dataset**: They also refer to a validation dataset used for testing the model's performance. I will identify this dataset and its citation.

3. **Property predictors**: The authors mention using property predictors from the RDKit package and oracles from Therapeutics Data Commons. I will check if these are considered datasets in the context of their research.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include full citations for each dataset as per the requirements. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with proper attribution.
