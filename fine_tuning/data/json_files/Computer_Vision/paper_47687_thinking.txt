To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Glioblastoma Multiforme Prognosis: MRI Missing Modality Generation, Segmentation and Radiogenomic Survival Prediction" by Mobarakol Islam, Navodini Wijethilake, and Hongliang Ren, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize the **TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas)** dataset and the **BraTS-2017** dataset for their study, which suggests that these are key datasets to focus on.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **methods section**. The authors mention that the **BraTS-2017 dataset** is used for training and validation of their models, containing 285 training cases and 46 validation cases, each with four MRI modalities. This dataset is crucial for their synthesis and segmentation models.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm the use of the **TCGA dataset** for overall survival prediction, noting that it consists of both MRI and genomic data. They specify that 202 patient cases with gene expression data were utilized, with 106 cases having corresponding MRI data.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **BraTS-2017 dataset**, the citation is:
   > B. H. Menze, A. Jakab, S. Bauer, J. Kalpathy-Cramer, K. Farahani, J. Kirby, Y. Burren, N. Porz, J. Slotboom, R. Wiest, et al. "The multimodal brain tumor image segmentation benchmark (brats)." *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, vol. 34, no. 10, pp. 1993–2024, 2015.

2. For the **TCGA dataset**, the citation is:
   > R. G. Verhaak, K. A. Hoadley, E. Purdom, V. Wang, Y. Qi, M. D. Wilkerson, C. R. Miller, L. Ding, T. Golub, J. P. Mesirov, et al. "Integrated genomic analysis identifies clinically relevant subtypes of glioblastoma characterized by abnormalities in PDGFRA, IDH1, EGFR, and NF1." *Cancer Cell*, vol. 17, no. 1, pp. 98–110, 2010.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately captured the details necessary for further processing or review. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important information regarding the datasets used in the research.
