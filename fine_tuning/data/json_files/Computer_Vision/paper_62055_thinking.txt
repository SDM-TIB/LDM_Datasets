To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative Proxemics: A Prior for 3D Social Interaction from Images" by Lea Müller et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created 3D training data using image datasets with contact annotations, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **implementation details** and **experiments sections**. In the implementation section, the authors mention using **FlickrCI3D Signatures** as a dataset for creating 3D fits. They describe it as a dataset of images showing interacting humans collected from Flickr, which includes discrete human-human contact annotations. This is a key dataset for their work.

Additionally, they reference **CHI3D**, a MoCap dataset containing interactions between pairs of people, which is used for training and evaluation. They describe it as containing sequences of interactions like hugs and kicks, which is relevant for their experiments.

The authors also mention **Hi4D**, another MoCap dataset that includes interactions between pairs of people, which they use for training and evaluation as well. This dataset is noted for its variety of interactions, including dancing and hugging.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **FlickrCI3D Signatures**:
   > Fieraru, M., Zanfir, M., Oneata, E., Popa, A.-I., Olaru, V., & Sminchisescu, C. (2020). Three-dimensional reconstruction of human interactions. In *Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*, pp. 7214–7223.

2. **CHI3D**:
   > Yin, Y., Guo, C., Kaufmann, M., Zarate, J., Song, J., & Hilliges, O. (2023). Hi4d: 4d instance segmentation of close human interaction. In *Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*.

3. **Hi4D**:
   > Yin, Y., Guo, C., Kaufmann, M., Zarate, J., Song, J., & Hilliges, O. (2023). Hi4d: 4d instance segmentation of close human interaction. In *Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
