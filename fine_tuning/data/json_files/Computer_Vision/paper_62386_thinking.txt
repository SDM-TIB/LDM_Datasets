To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-World Performance of Autonomously Reporting Normal Chest Radiographs in NHS Trusts Using a Deep-Learning Algorithm on the GP Pathway" by J. Smith et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves a deep-learning algorithm deployed in two NHS Trusts, which suggests that there are datasets related to chest radiographs (CXRs) being analyzed.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly the **Data Sources subsection**. Here, the authors specify that a total of **4,654 radiographs** from **4,076 patients** were used for evaluation, collected from two NHS Trusts: Somerset NHS Foundation Trust (SFT) and Calderdale & Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust (CHFT). This is a clear indication of the dataset being utilized in the study.

The paper also mentions that the dataset spans a continuous six-week period from **April 1, 2023, to May 13, 2023**, and includes both posteroanterior (PA) and anteroposterior (AP) chest radiographs. Additionally, it notes that the dataset is fully anonymized, which is important for ethical considerations.

In the **Results section**, the authors provide performance metrics for the deep-learning algorithm applied to the dataset, confirming that the dataset is indeed the basis for their analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the dataset is derived from real-world clinical data rather than a publicly available dataset, so there may not be a formal citation like those found in traditional datasets. Instead, I will note the details of the dataset as described in the paper.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: Real-World Chest Radiographs Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset comprising 4,654 chest radiographs collected from 4,076 patients across two NHS Trusts (Somerset NHS Foundation Trust and Calderdale & Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust) over a six-week period. The dataset includes both PA and AP views and is fully anonymized.
- **Time Period**: April 1, 2023, to May 13, 2023.

Since there are no formal citations for this dataset, I will note that it is based on real-world clinical data from the NHS Trusts involved in the study.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I have captured all relevant details about the dataset as described in the paper.
