To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reducing the Representation Error of GAN Image Priors Using the Deep Decoder" by Max Daniels et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors discuss using GANs and Deep Decoders for image reconstruction tasks, which suggests that datasets related to image processing might be involved.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they demonstrate their method on compressive sensing tasks using images from the **CelebA dataset** and the **Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 dataset**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are integral to their research.

I will then look for specific details about each dataset, such as the number of images, types of images, and any relevant characteristics. The paper states that the **CelebA dataset** consists of celebrity faces, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's context. The **Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 dataset** is mentioned as containing images of birds, which is also important for classification purposes.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets easily.

The citations I will extract are:

1. For the **CelebA dataset**:
   > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). Deep learning face attributes in the wild. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), December 2015.

2. For the **Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 dataset**:
   > Welinder, P., Branson, S., Mita, T., Wah, C., Schroff, F., Belongie, S., & Perona, P. (2010). Caltech-UCSD Birds 200. Technical Report CNS-TR-2010-001, California Institute of Technology.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited in any subsequent work or analysis.
