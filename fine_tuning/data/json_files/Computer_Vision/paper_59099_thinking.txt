To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Guiding Energy-Based Models via Contrastive Latent Variables" by Jongheon Jeong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors describe their methodology and results. In **Section 4.1 (Unconditional Image Generation)**, the authors state that they trained their model on **CIFAR-10** and **ImageNet 32x32** datasets. This is a clear indication that these datasets are used in their experiments.

I will then look for any additional details about these datasets in the text. The authors mention that they generated 50,000 samples using SGLD and evaluated their quality using Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) scores, which further confirms the use of these datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.

- For **ImageNet 32x32**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 248–255, 2009.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
