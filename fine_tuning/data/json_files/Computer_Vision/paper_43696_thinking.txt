To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Optimal Transport Through The Convolution Of Kernels With Evolving Measures" by Daeyoung Kim and Esteban G. Tabak, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed algorithm but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and experiments sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the optimal transport problem and its relevance to machine learning, but they do not specify any datasets. This suggests that the datasets may be introduced later in the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors illustrate their algorithm with numerical examples. Here, they mention using samples generated from specific distributions, such as a Gaussian distribution and a tri-modal Gaussian mixture distribution. However, they do not provide formal dataset names or references.

Since the paper does not explicitly list any datasets with formal names or citations, I will look for any references to datasets in the **References section**. The authors cite various works related to optimal transport and density estimation, but they do not provide specific datasets that are publicly available or widely recognized.

Given that the paper primarily discusses theoretical concepts and algorithms without referencing established datasets, I will conclude that there are no formal datasets to extract from this paper. 

If there were datasets mentioned, I would ensure to extract their names, descriptions, and full citations from the references. However, in this case, I will note that the paper focuses on algorithmic contributions rather than empirical evaluations using specific datasets.

In summary, I will compile my findings and note that no formal datasets were identified in this research paper.
