To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ControlVAE: Model-Based Learning of Generative Controllers for Physics-Based Characters" by Heyuan Yao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used for training and evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they trained their ControlVAE on an unstructured motion capture dataset consisting of four long motion sequences selected from the open-source LaFAN dataset. This indicates that the LaFAN dataset is one of the primary datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. In this paper, the authors describe the dataset in detail, noting that it includes diverse motions such as walking, running, jumping, and getting up. They also mention that the motion sequences were downsampled to 20 fps and augmented with mirrored sequences, resulting in an augmented dataset with approximately 30 minutes of high-quality motion.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the LaFAN dataset, which is crucial for their experiments.

The full citation for the LaFAN dataset is:
> Felix G. Harvey, Mike Yurick, Derek Nowrouzezahrai, and Christopher Pal. *Robust Motion In-Betweening*. ACM Trans. Graph. 39, 4 (July 2020), 64:64:1â€“64:64:12.

Additionally, the authors mention using the SFU motion capture dataset, which is another dataset relevant to their work. The citation for the SFU dataset is:
> Simon Fraser University and National University of Singapore. *SFU Motion Capture Database*. https://mocap.cs.sfu.ca.

Now, I will compile the extracted datasets into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
