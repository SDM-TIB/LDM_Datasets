To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-grained Analysis of In-context Linear Estimation: Data, Architecture, and Beyond" by Yingcong Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper, as these sections typically provide insights into the datasets used for the research. The abstract mentions that the authors explore the optimization landscape of in-context learning (ICL) and conduct experiments, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) to find explicit mentions of datasets. I will look for any tables, figures, or descriptions that detail the datasets used in their experiments. 

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Synthetic Linear Data**: This dataset is generated based on a linear model with specific parameters. The authors describe the characteristics of this dataset, including the distribution of features and labels.

2. **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Data**: This dataset is designed to evaluate the performance of their model under retrieval-augmented conditions. The authors provide details on how this dataset is constructed, including the correlation between task and feature vectors.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works that are referenced. However, since the datasets mentioned are synthetic or constructed for the purpose of the study, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets.

For the **Synthetic Linear Data**, I will note that it is a custom dataset created for the experiments, and I will describe its characteristics based on the information provided in the paper.

For the **RAG Data**, I will summarize its construction and purpose, as it is also a custom dataset used in the context of the research.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the names and descriptions of the datasets along with any relevant details about their construction or usage in the experiments. I will also make sure to clarify that these datasets are not publicly available and are specific to the study conducted by the authors.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Synthetic Linear Data**: A dataset generated based on a linear model with specific parameters.
2. **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Data**: A dataset designed to evaluate model performance under retrieval-augmented conditions.

I will ensure to document the details clearly and accurately for future reference or analysis.
