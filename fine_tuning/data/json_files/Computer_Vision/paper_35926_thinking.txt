To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stochastic Learning of Nonstationary Kernels for Natural Language Modeling" by Sahil Garg, Greg Ver Steeg, and Aram Galstyan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their approach on a "challenging real-world (structured inference) problem of automatically extracting biological models from the text of scientific papers." This suggests that datasets related to biological models may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the relevance of their work to natural language processing (NLP) tasks and structured predictions. They mention the extraction of structured information about biomolecular interactions, which implies the use of specific datasets for training and evaluation.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used in their evaluations. The authors state that they used three datasets, including two public ones: **PubMed45-ERN** and **BioNLP**. They also refer to an unpublished dataset, collectively referred to as the "All" dataset, which contains approximately 100k unique data points.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **PubMed45-ERN**: The citation is:
   > Garg, S., Ver Steeg, G., & Galstyan, A. (2016). Extracting biomolecular interactions using semantic parsing of biomedical text. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

2. **BioNLP**: The citation is:
   > Kim, J.-D., Ohta, T., Pyysalo, S., Bossy, R., Nguyen, N., & Tsujii, J. (2009). Overview of BioNLP'09 shared task on event extraction. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Current Trends in Biomedical Natural Language Processing: Shared Task.

3. **All Dataset**: Since this dataset is unpublished, I will note that it is referenced in the paper but does not have a formal citation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
