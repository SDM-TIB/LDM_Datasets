To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Disentangling Imperfect: A Wavelet-Infused Multilevel Heterogeneous Network for Human Activity Recognition in Flawed Wearable Sensor Data" by Mengna Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted an experimental study using **seven publicly available datasets**, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the datasets used. In this section, they provide a list of the datasets along with brief descriptions. I will carefully note the names and details of each dataset mentioned.

The paper lists the following datasets:

1. **WISDM Dataset**: This dataset comprises three-axial accelerometer signals from Android smartphones, sampled at 20 Hz, collected from 29 volunteers performing six distinct activities.

2. **UCI-HAR Dataset**: Curated by Bulbul et al., this dataset involves 30 subjects performing six activities while wearing smartphones on their waists, including accelerometer and gyroscope readings at a 50 Hz sampling rate.

3. **PAMAP2 Dataset**: Designed to monitor daily living activities using three inertial measurement units, this dataset contains 5,333 segments, each with 600 observations at a 100 Hz sampling rate.

4. **Opportunity Dataset**: Collected in a breakfast scenario, this dataset includes readings from various types of sensors, focusing on data from five body-worn inertial measurement units (IMUs).

5. **RealWorld Dataset**: This dataset collects activities from 15 users, with data from 13 users performing eight different physical activities.

6. **Realdisp Dataset**: Curated to explore the effects of sensor displacements, this dataset includes data from 10 users performing 33 distinct fitness activities.

7. **Skoda Dataset**: This dataset captures 10 distinct manipulative gestures performed by an assembly-line worker, specifically using data from the right arm.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
