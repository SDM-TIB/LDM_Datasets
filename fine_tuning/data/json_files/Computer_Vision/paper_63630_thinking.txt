To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Edit Temporal-Consistent Videos with Image Diffusion Model" by Yuanzhi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of "large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models" and "text-guided video editing," which suggests that datasets may be involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges in text-guided video editing and mention existing methods. I will look for any references to datasets used in their experiments or comparisons.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for a dedicated subsection that discusses the datasets used. The authors mention conducting experiments on the "LOVEU-TGVE-2023" dataset, which is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its purpose and characteristics.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the "LOVEU-TGVE-2023" dataset. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and should include the authors, title, source, and year of publication.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **LOVEU-TGVE-2023**: This dataset is used for text-guided video editing tasks, including style transfer, object editing, background change, and multiple-object editing. It contains various video samples that are manipulated based on edited prompts.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation:

- For **LOVEU-TGVE-2023**, the citation is:
  > LOVEU-TGVE-2023. *Text-Guided Video Editing Dataset*. Available at: https://github.com/showlab/loveu-tgve-2023.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is organized and ready for further processing or review, maintaining clarity and accuracy in the dataset descriptions and citations.
