To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HVS Revisited: A Comprehensive Video Quality Assessment Framework" by Ao-Xiang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed framework is evaluated on various mainstream video datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will navigate to **Section IV (Experimental Results)**, where the authors typically provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for a table or a list that summarizes the datasets, including their characteristics such as the number of videos, resolution, and types of distortions.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find a **Table II** that provides a brief introduction to six video datasets used in the experiments. The datasets listed are:

1. **KoNViD-1k**: This dataset contains 1200 videos in RGB format, with a frame rate of 24, 25, or 30 fps, and a duration of 8 seconds. It is an in-the-wild dataset with crowdsourced annotations.
   
2. **CVD2014**: This dataset consists of 234 videos in RGB format, with frame rates ranging from 11 to 31 fps and durations between 10 to 25 seconds. It is an in-capture dataset evaluated in a lab setting.

3. **LIVE-VQC**: This dataset includes 585 videos in RGB format, with frame rates from 19 to 30 fps (one at 120 fps) and a duration of over 10 seconds. It is also an in-the-wild dataset with crowdsourced annotations.

4. **LIVE-Qualcomm**: This dataset has 208 videos in YUV format, with a frame rate of 30 fps and a duration of 15 seconds. It is an in-capture dataset evaluated in a lab setting.

5. **YouTube-UGC**: This dataset has 1142 videos in YUV format, with frame rates from 15 to 60 fps and a duration of 20 seconds. It is an in-the-wild dataset with crowdsourced annotations.

6. **LSVQ**: This dataset contains 39072 videos in RGB format, with frame rates ranging from 5 to 12 fps and durations between 5 to 12 seconds. It is also an in-the-wild dataset with crowdsourced annotations.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are typically provided in the format of conference papers or journal articles where the datasets were introduced or described.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Now, I will prepare to format this information into a structured output that can be used for further analysis or processing.
