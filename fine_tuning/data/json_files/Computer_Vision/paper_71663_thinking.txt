To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UniMD: Towards Unifying Moment Retrieval and Temporal Action Detection" by Yingsen Zeng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that their experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results on three paired datasets: **Ego4D**, **Charades-STA**, and **ActivityNet**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention the datasets and their characteristics:

1. **Ego4D**: This dataset is described as a large-scale first-person video dataset consisting of approximately 3000 hours of egocentric videos. It includes 110 action categories and has an average of 9.2 instances per video across 2000 videos.

2. **Charades**: This dataset consists of 9.8k videos with an average duration of 30 seconds and includes 157 action categories that are densely labeled. The related dataset **Charades-STA** introduces natural language descriptions as annotations and consists of 6.6k videos.

3. **ActivityNet (ANet)**: This dataset contains around 20,000 videos and is divided into 200 action categories. The related dataset **ActivityNet-Caption** includes descriptions of events and their corresponding timestamps, also comprising approximately 20,000 videos.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

- For **Ego4D**, the citation is:
  > Kristen Grauman et al. *Ego4D: Around the world in 3,000 hours of egocentric video*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 18995–19012, 2022.

- For **Charades**, the citation is:
  > Gunnar A Sigurdsson et al. *Hollywood in homes: Crowdsourcing data collection for activity understanding*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2016: 14th European Conference, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, October 11–14, 2016, Proceedings, Part I 14, pages 510–526.

- For **ActivityNet**, the citation is:
  > Fabian Caba Heilbron et al. *Activitynet: A large-scale video benchmark for human activity understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 961–970, 2015.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
