To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AtteSTNet - An attention and subword tokenization based approach for code-switched Hindi-English hate speech detection" by Geet Shingia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset description sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved results on "standard datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Dataset Description and Results)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their study. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **HEOT Dataset**: This dataset consists of 3,679 tweets collected using the Twitter Streaming API, focusing on profane terms in Hinglish (Hindi-English code-switched language). The dataset is labeled into three categories: non-abusive, abusive, and hate-inducing.

2. **Davidson Dataset**: This dataset contains 14,509 records of English tweets, collected from 33,485 users, resulting in a total of 85.4 million tweets from which random samples were manually labeled.

The authors provide a detailed breakdown of the tweet distribution in both datasets, which confirms their relevance and usage in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **HEOT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > P. Mathur, R. Shah, R. Sawhney, and D. Mahata. "Detecting offensive tweets in Hindi-English code-switched language." In Proceedings of the Sixth International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media, Melbourne, Australia: Association for Computational Linguistics, Jul. 2018, pp. 18–26. Available: https://aclanthology.org/W18-3504

- For the **Davidson Dataset**, the citation is:
  > T. Davidson, D. Warmsley, M. Macy, and I. Weber. "Automated hate speech detection and the problem of offensive language."

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
