To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Discrete Prompt Optimization for Diffusion Models" by Ruochen Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention empirical evaluation on prompts collected from diverse sources, specifically **DiffusionDB**, **ChatGPT**, and **COCO**. This indicates that these sources may be datasets or repositories relevant to the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 7) where the authors describe the dataset preparation. They explicitly state that they collected prompts from three sources: **DiffusionDB**, **ChatGPT**, and **COCO**. This confirms that these are indeed datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will gather detailed information about each dataset:

1. **DiffusionDB**: The authors describe it as a large prompt database comprised of 2 million highly diverse prompts for text-to-image generation. They filtered prompts from this database for their experiments.

2. **ChatGPT**: The authors mention that they queried ChatGPT for prompts, noting that it tends to produce vivid and poetic descriptions. They filtered prompts generated by ChatGPT for their experiments.

3. **COCO**: The authors used captions from the 2014 validation split of the MS-COCO dataset as prompts. They filtered these prompts similarly to the other sources.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **DiffusionDB**, the citation is:
  > Wang, Z. J., Montoya, E., Munechika, D., Yang, H., Hoover, B., and Chau, D. H. *DiffusionDB: A large-scale prompt gallery dataset for text-to-image generative models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.14896, 2022.

- For **ChatGPT**, since it is a product of OpenAI, I will reference it as:
  > Ouyang, L., Wu, J., Jiang, X., Almeida, D., Wainwright, C., Mishkin, P., Zhang, C., Agarwal, S., Slama, K., Ray, A., et al. *Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35:27730–27744, 2022.

- For **COCO**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., and Zitnick, C. L. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V 13, pp. 740–755. Springer, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets mentioned in the paper.
