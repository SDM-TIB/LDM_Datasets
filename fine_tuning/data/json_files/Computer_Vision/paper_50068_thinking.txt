To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MODNet-V: Improving Portrait Video Matting via Background Restoration" by Jiayu Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in prior work.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, which is likely to contain explicit mentions of the datasets used in the study. In this section, the authors state that they use the **VideoMatte240K dataset** proposed by Background Matting V2 as the labeled foregrounds and mention using approximately 1000 video clips from the internet as unlabeled data. This section is crucial as it provides specific details about the datasets.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. For the **VideoMatte240K dataset**, I will look for the original paper that introduced it. The citation is as follows:
> Shanchuan Lin, Andrey Ryabtsev, Soumyadip Sengupta, Brian L Curless, Steven M Seitz, and Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman. *Real-time high-resolution background matting*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 8762â€“8771, 2021.

For the unlabeled data, since it consists of video clips sourced from the internet, it may not have a formal citation. However, I will note that it is a collection of approximately 1000 video clips.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **VideoMatte240K Dataset**: This dataset is used for training and provides labeled foregrounds for video matting tasks.

2. **Unlabeled Video Clips**: A collection of approximately 1000 video clips sourced from the internet, used as unlabeled data for training.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that full citations are included where applicable. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
