To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ReGS: Reference-based Controllable Scene Stylization with Gaussian Splatting" by Yiqun Mei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. They state that the only available reference-based stylization dataset is provided by another paper, which indicates that I need to look for the details of this dataset.

The paper mentions that the dataset contains **12 selected scenes from Blender, LLFF, and Tanks and Temples**, and that each scene is paired with a content-aligned reference image. This gives me a clear understanding of the dataset's composition and purpose.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

- For the **Blender dataset**, the citation is:
  > Blender Foundation. *Blender 3D: No Cost Open Source 3D Content Creation*. Available at: https://www.blender.org/

- For the **LLFF dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mildenhall, B., Srinivasan, P. P., Ortiz-Cayon, R., Kalantari, N. K., Ramamoorthi, R., Ng, R., & Kar, A. (2019). *Local Light Field Fusion: Practical View Synthesis with Prescriptive Sampling Guidelines*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 38(4), 1-14.

- For the **Tanks and Temples dataset**, the citation is:
  > Knapitsch, A., Park, J., Zhou, Q.-Y., & Koltun, V. (2017). *Tanks and Temples: Benchmarking Large-Scale Scene Reconstruction*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 36(4).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, providing full citations for each to maintain academic integrity and facilitate further research.
