To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lifelog Patterns Analyzation using Graph Embedding based on Deep Neural Network" by Wonsup Shin, Tae-Young Kim, and Sung-Bae Cho, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used the **UbiqLog dataset** for their experiments, which is a strong lead.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experimental Result)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the UbiqLog dataset. They describe it as a dataset collected from 35 smartphone users over two months, containing data from various sensors, with a total of 9,782,222 instances. This section confirms that the UbiqLog dataset is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the UbiqLog dataset. The authors reference the dataset as being provided by the UCI machine learning repository, and I will need to locate the specific citation for it.

The citation for the UbiqLog dataset is:
> Rawassizadeh, R., Momeni, E., Dobbins, C., Gharibshah, J., & Pazzani, M. (2016). *Scalable daily human behavioral pattern mining from multivariate temporal data*. IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 28(11), 3098-3112.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will prepare to create an entry for the UbiqLog dataset, ensuring that I include all relevant details such as the dataset name, description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
