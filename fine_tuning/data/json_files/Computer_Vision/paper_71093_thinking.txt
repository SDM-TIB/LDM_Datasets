To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Diffusion Modelsâ€™s Data-Corruption Resistance using Scheduled Pseudo-Huber Loss" by Artem Khrapov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their approach on "corrupted datasets in both image and audio domains," which indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for their experiments. In **subsection 3.1 (Text-to-Image)**, they mention using the **Dreambooth framework** on **Stable Diffusion v1.5** and adapting it on **7 different datasets** across various domains. However, the specific names of these datasets are not listed in this subsection, so I will need to look further.

In **subsection 3.2 (Text-to-Speech)**, the authors describe their experiments with **Grad-TTS** for speaker adaptation, mentioning that they constructed datasets for each speaker, including a "clean" dataset and "corrupted" datasets. They specify that they used **16 records of the target speaker** and **2 corrupted records** for each of the **10 female and 4 male speakers**. However, the exact names of these datasets are still not provided.

To find the specific datasets, I will check the **appendices** and **references** sections. In the **appendices**, they provide a brief overview of the datasets used, including images from each dataset, but they do not provide formal names or citations. 

Finally, I will consult the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The authors reference various works related to the methodologies and frameworks they used, but they do not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves.

Since the paper does not explicitly name the datasets or provide full citations, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Text-to-Image Datasets**: The authors mention using 7 different datasets for text-to-image customization experiments, but they do not specify the names or provide citations.

2. **Text-to-Speech Datasets**: The authors constructed datasets for speaker adaptation, including a clean dataset with 16 records and corrupted datasets for 10 female and 4 male speakers, but again, no specific names or citations are provided.

Given this analysis, I will note that while the paper discusses the use of datasets, it lacks specific names and citations for those datasets. Therefore, I will document the findings accordingly, indicating that the datasets are referenced but not explicitly named or cited in the paper.
