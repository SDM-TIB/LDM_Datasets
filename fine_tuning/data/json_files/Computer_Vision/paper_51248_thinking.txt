To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Conditional Point Diffusion-Refinement Paradigm for 3D Point Cloud Completion" by Zhaoyang Lyu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on various benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **MVP Dataset**: This dataset consists of 62,400 training partial-complete point cloud pairs and 41,600 testing pairs sampled from ShapeNet. Each partial point cloud contains 2048 points, and the dataset provides ground truth point clouds with different resolutions.

2. **MVP-40 Dataset**: This dataset includes 41,600 training samples and 64,168 testing samples from 40 categories in ModelNet40. The partial point clouds are sampled from complete point clouds with predefined missing ratios.

3. **Completion3D Dataset**: This dataset consists of 28,974 point cloud pairs for training and 1,184 for testing from 8 object categories in ShapeNet. The authors note that some pairs had inconsistent scales, which they corrected before using the dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For the **MVP Dataset**:
  > Liang Pan, Xinyi Chen, Zhongang Cai, Junzhe Zhang, Haiyu Zhao, Shuai Yi, and Ziwei Liu. *Variational relational point completion network*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 8524–8533, 2021.

- For the **MVP-40 Dataset**:
  > Zhirong Wu, Shuran Song, Aditya Khosla, Fisher Yu, Linguang Zhang, Xiaoou Tang, and Jianxiong Xiao. *3D ShapeNets: A deep representation for volumetric shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 1912–1920, 2015.

- For the **Completion3D Dataset**:

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
