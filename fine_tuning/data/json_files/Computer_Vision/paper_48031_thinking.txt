To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning for Bayesian Optimization of Scientific Problems with High-Dimensional Structure" by Samuel Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments conducted, and it mentions the use of several scientific datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and results sections** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention three main datasets:

1. **QM9 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 133,885 small organic molecules along with their geometric, electronic, and thermodynamic properties calculated using density functional theory (DFT). The authors utilize this dataset for optimizing chemical properties.

2. **Nanoparticle Scattering Dataset**: This dataset is related to the multilayer nanoparticle problem, where the authors describe the scattering spectrum of nanoparticles based on their structural parameters. The dataset is generated through analytical calculations based on the physical properties of the nanoparticles.

3. **Photonic Crystal Dataset**: This dataset involves the topology optimization of photonic crystal materials, where the authors describe the optical properties of photonic crystals based on their unit cell structures.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **QM9 Dataset**, the citation is:
> Ruddigkeit, L., Van Deursen, R., Blum, L. C., & Reymond, J.-L. (2012). Enumeration of 166 billion organic small molecules in the chemical universe database gdb-17. *Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling*, 52(11), 2864-2875.

For the **Nanoparticle Scattering Dataset**, the citation is:
> Qiu, W., DeLacy, B. G., Johnson, S. G., & Joannopoulos, J. D. (2012). Optimization of broadband optical response of multilayer nanospheres. *Optics Express*, 20(16), 18494-18504.

For the **Photonic Crystal Dataset**, the citation is:
> Joannopoulos, J. D., Johnson, S. G., Winn, J. N., & Meade, R. D. (2008). *Photonic Crystals: Molding the Flow of Light*. Princeton University Press.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
