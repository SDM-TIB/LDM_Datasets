To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DiffYOLO: Object Detection for Anti-Noise via YOLO and Diffusion Models" by Yichen Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for testing the proposed method. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of object detection in noisy environments and the need for effective datasets to train and evaluate their models. However, I need to look for specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they describe the **DeepPCB dataset**, which consists of 1500 samples of PCB defects. This section provides details about the dataset, including the types of defects it contains and the context in which it was used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **DeepPCB dataset**. The authors may not provide a specific citation for this dataset if it is not widely published, but I will look for any related works or foundational papers that describe it.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation for the **DeepPCB dataset**. If the dataset is not cited in the references, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset or provide any available information about its origin.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
