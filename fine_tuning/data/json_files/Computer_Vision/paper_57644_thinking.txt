To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diﬀ-Font: Diﬀusion Model for Robust One-Shot Font Generation" by Haibin He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenges of font generation for complex languages and hint at the datasets they have compiled for their experiments. This suggests that there are specific datasets that will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Chinese Font Dataset**: This dataset consists of 410 fonts, each containing 6,625 Chinese characters. The authors specify that they use both a small dataset (400 fonts and 800 characters) and a large dataset (400 fonts with all 6,625 characters) for their experiments.

2. **Korean Font Dataset**: The authors describe a dataset of 201 Korean fonts, with 195 used for training and 6 for testing, containing a total of 2,350 Korean characters.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are compiled by the authors themselves, they may not have external citations. Instead, I will note that the datasets are available at the provided GitHub link.

Now, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and any relevant details:

- **Chinese Font Dataset**: 
  - Description: A dataset containing 410 fonts, each with 6,625 Chinese characters. It includes both small (400 fonts, 800 characters) and large (400 fonts, all characters) datasets for evaluation.
  - Citation: Not applicable (compiled by the authors).

- **Korean Font Dataset**: 
  - Description: A dataset of 201 Korean fonts, with 195 for training and 6 for testing, containing 2,350 Korean characters.
  - Citation: Not applicable (compiled by the authors).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its description and citation status. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or processing.
