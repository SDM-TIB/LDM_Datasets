To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Generalization of Diffusion Model" by Mingyang Yi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used for experiments or comparisons.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention using generative models and refer to empirical results, but they do not specify any datasets yet. I will continue to the **experiments section**, which is typically where datasets are explicitly mentioned.

Upon reaching the **experiments section**, I find that the authors state they conducted experiments on two specific datasets: **CIFAR10** and **CelebA**. They describe these datasets in terms of their characteristics and the context in which they are used for training and evaluation.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations I find are:

1. **CIFAR10**:
   > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. *Technical Report*, University of Toronto.

2. **CelebA**:
   > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). Deep learning face attributes in the wild. In *Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)*, pages 3730-3738.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
