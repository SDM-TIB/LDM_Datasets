To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reachability Embeddings: Scalable Self-Supervised Representation Learning from Mobility Trajectories for Multimodal Geospatial Computer Vision" by Swetava Ganguli et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize **probe data** for their experiments, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, in the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing GPS trajectory datasets and mention the use of **probe data** as a solution. This indicates that the probe data is a significant dataset used in their work.

In the **dataset description section (Section IV)**, the authors elaborate on the characteristics of the datasets they are using. They specifically mention that they are using **probe data**, which is a proprietary dataset collected across various geographic regions. This dataset is essential for training supervised semantic segmentation models for the downstream tasks discussed later in the paper.

The authors also mention that they are using **T-Drive dataset** for scalability tests in Section III-D. This dataset is publicly available and contains location coordinates and timestamps for taxi trajectories in Beijing.

Now, I will look for the full citations for these datasets in the **References section** of the paper:

1. **Probe Data**: The authors refer to this dataset as a privacy-preserving, structured, sequential dataset but do not provide a specific citation. However, they mention that it is used for training supervised models across various geographic regions.

2. **T-Drive Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > J. Yuan et al., “T-Drive: Driving directions based on taxi trajectories,” in ACM SIGSPATIAL, 2010.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Probe Data**: A proprietary dataset used for training supervised models across various geographic regions. Specific citation details are not provided in the paper.
  
- **T-Drive Dataset**: A publicly available dataset containing location coordinates and timestamps for taxi trajectories in Beijing. The citation is:
   > J. Yuan et al., “T-Drive: Driving directions based on taxi trajectories,” in ACM SIGSPATIAL, 2010.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
