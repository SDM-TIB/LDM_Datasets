To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multisample Flow Matching: Straightening Flows with Minibatch Couplings" by Aram-Alexandre Pooladian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions improvements in sample consistency on downsampled ImageNet datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors describe their empirical investigations. Here, they explicitly mention using **ImageNet** as a benchmark dataset for their experiments. They detail that they used the official face-blurred ImageNet data and downsampled it to 32x32 and 64x64 resolutions. This is a clear indication of the datasets used.

In addition to ImageNet, I will check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors discuss their methods in the context of generative modeling and optimal transport, but the primary dataset referenced for their experiments appears to be ImageNet.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The citation for ImageNet is as follows:
- **ImageNet**: 
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 248â€“255. IEEE.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets identified in the paper, ensuring to include the full citations as required. The primary dataset extracted is:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset used for benchmarking in computer vision, specifically for training and evaluating generative models.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
