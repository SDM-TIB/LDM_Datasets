To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gaussian Database Alignment and Gaussian Planted Matching" by Osman E. Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their studies. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant statistics.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors refer to any datasets when discussing their findings. This can provide additional context about how the datasets were utilized in the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it allows for proper attribution and enables readers to locate the original sources of the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I would look for the citation in the references, which might be formatted as follows:
- Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset.
3. The full citation for the dataset.

Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset documentation.
