To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Embedding of Hierarchical Structure in Euclidean Space" by Jinyu Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit references to datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup."

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using a synthetic dataset called **Binary Tree Gaussian Mixture (BTGM)**, which is described in detail. They explain how this dataset is constructed and its parameters, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

Additionally, the authors mention using several real datasets for their experiments, including:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits, commonly used for training various image processing systems.

2. **Reuters Dataset**: A collection of news documents that is often used for text classification tasks.

3. **CIFAR-25 Dataset**: A subset of the CIFAR-100 dataset, which includes images from 25 classes.

4. **20 Newsgroups Dataset**: A collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned across 20 different newsgroups.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The citations I will look for include:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- For the **Reuters Dataset**, the citation is:
  > David D. Lewis. *Reuters-21578 Text Categorization Test Collection*. 1997.

- For the **CIFAR-25 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.

- For the **20 Newsgroups Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ken Lang. *Newsweeder: Learning to Filter Netnews*. In Proceedings of the Twelfth International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 331â€“339, 1995.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference and use in future work. This will ensure that all datasets are properly documented and attributed.
