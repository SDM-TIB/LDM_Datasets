To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Test-Time Adaptation for Depth Completion" by Hyoungseob Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on various datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified. I will look for specific names of datasets mentioned in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is typically where datasets used for evaluation are detailed. In this section, the authors explicitly mention several datasets used for their experiments, including:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing calibrated RGB images with synchronized point clouds from Velodyne lidar, inertial, and GPS information. It consists of approximately 80K raw image frames and associated sparse depth maps.

2. **VOID Dataset**: This dataset includes synchronized RGB images and sparse depth maps from indoor and outdoor scenes. It contains around 46K images for training.

3. **NYUv2 Dataset**: This dataset consists of synchronized RGB images and depth maps from indoor scenes, with a total of 372K images.

4. **ScanNet Dataset**: This dataset contains 2.5 million images and dense depth maps for 1,513 indoor scenes.

5. **Virtual KITTI Dataset**: This dataset includes synthetic images created from KITTI videos, with a significant domain gap between RGB images from VKITTI and KITTI.

6. **nuScenes Dataset**: This dataset consists of calibrated RGB images and synchronized sparse point clouds from outdoor driving scenes.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for each of these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For example, the citation for the **KITTI Dataset** is:
> Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, Christoph Stiller, and Raquel Urtasun. *Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, 32:1231–1237, 2013.

Similarly, I will find the citations for the other datasets mentioned:

- **VOID Dataset**: 
> Hyoungseob Park, et al. *VOID: A Dataset for Visual-Inertial Odometry in Indoor Environments*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2019.

- **NYUv2 Dataset**: 
> Nathan Silberman, Derek Hoiem, Pushmeet Kohli, and Rob Fergus. *Indoor segmentation and support inference from RGBD images*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, 2012.

- **ScanNet Dataset**: 
> Angela Dai, Angel X Chang, Manolis Savva, Maciej Halber, Thomas Funkhouser, and Matthias Nießner. *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2017.

- **Virtual KITTI Dataset**: 
> Adrien Gaidon, Qiao Wang, Yohann Cabon, and Eleonora Vig. *Virtual worlds as proxy for multi-object tracking analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016.

- **nuScenes Dataset**: 
> Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yu Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *nuScenes: A multi-modal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2020.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
