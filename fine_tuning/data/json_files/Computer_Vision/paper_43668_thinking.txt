To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploration-Exploitation Motivated Variational Auto-encoder for Recommender Systems" by Yizi Zhang and Meimei Liu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on various real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5.1.1 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **MovieLens-10M (ML-10M)**: This dataset consists of user-movie ratings collected from a movie recommendation service. The authors binarized the data by keeping ratings of four or higher and retained users and items with at least ten interactions.

2. **Netflix**: This dataset is derived from the Netflix Prize competition and also consists of user-movie ratings. Similar to ML-10M, the authors binarized the data by keeping ratings of four or higher and retained users and items with at least ten interactions.

3. **Alibaba**: This dataset is a large user behavior dataset from Alibaba's e-commerce platform. The authors binarized the data by keeping click and purchase behaviors, retaining users who clicked or purchased at least ten items and items accessed by at least ten users.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MovieLens-10M**, the citation is:
  > GroupLens Research. *MovieLens Datasets*. Available at: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

- For **Netflix**, the citation is:
  > Netflix. *Netflix Prize Dataset*. Available at: http://academictorrents.com/

- For **Alibaba**, the citation is:
  > Alibaba. *Alibaba E-commerce Dataset*. Available at: https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/dataDetail?dataId=46

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
