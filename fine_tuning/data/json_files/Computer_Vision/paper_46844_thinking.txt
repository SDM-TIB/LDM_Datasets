To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "ROUTINGGAN: ROUTING AGE PROGRESSION AND REGRESSION WITH DISENTANGLED LEARNING" by Zhizhong Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two benchmarked datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 3)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they conducted experiments on two benchmarked age datasets: **MORPH** and **CACD**. This is a clear indication that these are the datasets I need to extract.

In the **implementation details subsection (3.1)**, the authors provide additional context about the datasets, including the number of images available for each dataset: **MORPH** has a total of 159,585 images, while **CACD** has 55,139 images. This information is crucial for describing the datasets.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations provided in the paper are:

- For **MORPH**, the citation is:
  > K. Ricanek and T. Tesafaye. *MORPH: A longitudinal image database of normal adult age-progression*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG), pages 341–345, 2006.

- For **CACD**, the citation is:
  > B. Chen, C. Chen, and W. H. Hsu. *Face recognition and retrieval using cross-age reference coding with cross-age celebrity dataset*. IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM), vol. 17, no. 6, pages 804–815, 2015.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets:

1. **MORPH**: A longitudinal image database containing 159,585 images used for age progression and regression tasks.
2. **CACD**: A dataset with 55,139 images used for face recognition and retrieval across different ages.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its corresponding citation.
