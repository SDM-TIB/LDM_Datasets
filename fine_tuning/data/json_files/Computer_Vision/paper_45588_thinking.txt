To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ControlVAE: Tuning, Analytical Properties, and Performance Analysis" by Huajie Shao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors explicitly list the datasets and provide relevant details about each one.

From section 4.1, I note the following datasets:

1. **2D Shapes Dataset**: This dataset consists of 737,280 binary images of 2D shapes, with five ground truth factors (shape, scale, orientation, x-position, and y-position).

2. **CelebA Dataset**: A cropped version of the CelebA dataset, which contains 202,599 RGB images of celebrity faces, split into training and testing sets.

3. **Penn Tree Bank (PTB)**: This dataset includes 42,068 training sentences, 3,370 validation sentences, and 3,761 testing sentences.

4. **Switchboard Dataset**: This dataset comprises 2,400 two-sided telephone conversations with manually transcribed speech, randomly split into training, validation, and testing sets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I find are:

- For the **2D Shapes Dataset**:
  > Matthey, L., Higgins, I., Hassabis, D., & Lerchner, A. (2017). *dsprites: Testing sprites dataset*. URL: https://github.com/deepmind/dsprites-dataset/. [Accessed on: 2018-05-08].

- For the **CelebA Dataset**:
  > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 3730–3738.

- For the **Penn Tree Bank (PTB)**:
  > Marcus, M., Santorini, B., & Marcinkiewicz, M. A. (1993). *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Technical report.

- For the **Switchboard Dataset**:
  > Godfrey, J., & Holliman, E. (1997). *Switchboard-1 Release 2 - Linguistic Data Consortium*. SWITCHBOARD: A User’s Manual.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
