To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-armed Bandit Algorithms on System-on-Chip: Go Frequentist or Bayesian?" by S. V. Sai Santosh and Sumit J. Darak, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. These sections typically detail the datasets used for testing the algorithms and may include descriptions of their characteristics, such as size, type, and any relevant statistics.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any references to datasets used for evaluating the proposed algorithms. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper for full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure to extract the complete citation format as presented in the paper.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Bernoulli Bandit Dataset" or "Gaussian Bandit Dataset," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If no specific dataset is cited, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will compile the information about each dataset, including its name, description, and full citation, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the details provided.

By following these steps, I will be able to effectively extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, ensuring that I include all necessary citation information for each dataset identified.
