To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detection of ransomware attacks using federated learning based on the CNN model" by Hong Nhung Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions a ransomware detection method and the use of a CNN model, but it does not specify any datasets yet.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Proposed Method)**, particularly the **Data Collection** subsection, where the authors describe their dataset. They mention obtaining a collection of about **30,000 PE ransomware binaries** from virusshare.com, which is crucial for understanding the dataset used in their experiments.

In the same section, they detail the transformation of these binaries into images, which is an important aspect of their methodology. They also mention balancing the dataset to include **3,000 positive (malicious)** and **3,000 negative (benign)** examples, which is significant for the classification task.

I will also look at **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a summary of the dataset used for their experiments. They confirm that the dataset consists of **6,000 samples** divided equally between normal and ransomware data, which reinforces the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to the datasets. However, the paper primarily discusses the dataset it created and does not cite external datasets. Therefore, I will focus on documenting the dataset they constructed.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **Ransomware Dataset**: A collection of **3,000 ransomware binaries** and **3,000 benign binaries**. The ransomware binaries were sourced from virusshare.com and other sources, while benign examples were collected from Windows System32 and the Windows Application Store.

Since the authors do not provide a formal citation for their dataset in the references, I will note that this dataset is original to their research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and any relevant details about its composition and source.

This thorough approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper while providing proper documentation for future reference.
