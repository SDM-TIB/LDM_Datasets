To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MagiCapture: High-Resolution Multi-Concept Portrait Customization" by Junha Hyung et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the personalization of text-to-image models but does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction may provide more context.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of "provided sets of train images" for personalizing models. This suggests that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names or references.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any specific dataset names or descriptions that the authors might have included.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors refer to using images from the **VGGFace dataset** for their experiments. They mention that they selected 10 identities from this dataset, which indicates that it is a key dataset for their work.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the VGGFace dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Cao, Q.; Shen, L.; Xie, W.; Parkhi, O. M.; and Zisserman, A. 2018. *Vggface2: A dataset for recognising faces across pose and age*. In 2018 13th IEEE international conference on automatic face & gesture recognition (FG 2018), 67â€“74. IEEE.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the **VGGFace dataset** is the primary dataset referenced in this research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the full citation, into the required format for further processing or review.
