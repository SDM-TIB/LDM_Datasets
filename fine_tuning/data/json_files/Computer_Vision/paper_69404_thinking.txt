To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Point-VOS: Pointing Up Video Object Segmentation" by Idil Esen Zulfikar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their annotation scheme to **two large-scale video datasets**. This suggests that datasets are a key component of their research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors mention the creation of a new Point-VOS benchmark based on two datasets: **Point-VOS Oops** and **Point-VOS Kinetics**. They provide details about the number of points annotated and the scale of the datasets, which is crucial for understanding their significance.

In the **methods section**, particularly in the subsection discussing the datasets, the authors provide specific details about the two datasets:

1. **Point-VOS Oops (PV-Oops)**: This dataset consists of 8.4K videos and includes annotations for over 13K objects. The authors mention that they annotated points in the first frame for initialization and dense pixel masks for evaluation.

2. **Point-VOS Kinetics (PV-Kinetics)**: This dataset contains 23.9K videos and includes annotations for 120K objects. The authors highlight that this dataset is derived from the Kinetics dataset, which is known for its large-scale action recognition.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources of the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Point-VOS Oops**:
  > Dave Epstein, Boyuan Chen, and Carl Vondrick. *Oops! Predicting Unintentional Action in Video*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

- For **Point-VOS Kinetics**:
  > Will Kay, Joao Carreira, Karen Simonyan, Brian Zhang, Chloe Hillier, Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan, Fabio Viola, Tim Green, Trevor Back, Paul Natsev, et al. *The Kinetics Human Action Video Dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.06950, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
