To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Renormalizing Diffusion Models" by Jordan Cotler and Semon Rezchikov, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their studies. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics relevant to the research.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors refer to any datasets when discussing their findings. They may provide additional context or insights about the datasets that could be useful for understanding their significance in the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary attribution and allows others to locate the datasets for their own use.

For each dataset, I will document the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details such as the number of samples or features.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all this information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset and its associated details. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for future reference.
