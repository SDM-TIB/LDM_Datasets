To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neutral Editing Framework for Diffusion-based Video Editing" by Sunjae Yoon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on numerous videos, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiment)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for validation. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **DAVIS Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a video editing challenge dataset comprising 32 to 128 frames of each video. It is crucial to note the context in which it is used, as it validates the effectiveness of the proposed NeuEdit framework.

2. **LOVEU-TGVE Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned in the context of video editing challenges, indicating that it is used to assess the performance of the NeuEdit framework alongside the DAVIS dataset.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

- For the **DAVIS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jordi Pont-Tuset, Federico Perazzi, Sergi Caelles, Pablo ArbelÃ¡ez, Alex Sorkine-Hornung, and Luc Van Gool. *The 2017 DAVIS Challenge on Video Object Segmentation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.00675, 2017.

- For the **LOVEU-TGVE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jay Zhangjie Wu, Xiuyu Li, Difei Gao, Zhen Dong, Jinbin Bai, Aishani Singh, Xiaoyu Xiang, Youzeng Li, Zuwei Huang, Yuanxi Sun, et al. *CVPR 2023 Text Guided Video Editing Competition*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.16003, 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and that the full citations are included for reference. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
