To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-view deep learning for reliable post-disaster damage classification" by Asim B. Khajwal, Chih-Shen Cheng, and Arash Noshadravan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses a reconnaissance visual dataset containing expert-labeled, geotagged images of buildings inspected after Hurricane Harvey. This suggests that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, which provides a detailed description of the dataset. The authors mention that the data was collected by expert reconnaissance teams from the NSF-supported StEER network, specifically after Hurricane Harvey. They describe the dataset as containing multiple geotagged images of inspected buildings, with detailed observations and overall ratings based on on-site assessments.

In this section, the authors specify that the dataset includes images from 400 buildings, totaling 2000 images, which were annotated and assigned damage state labels ranging from 0 to 5. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the StEER network, which is essential for citing the dataset correctly. The relevant citation is:

- StEER, "Structural extreme event reconnaissance," in URL: https://www.steer.network/, 2020.

Additionally, they reference a collection of perishable data on wind-and surge-induced residential building damage during Hurricane Harvey, which is another important source for the dataset. The citation for this reference is:

- D. B. Roueche, F. T. Lombardo, R. J. Krupar, and D. J. Smith, "Collection of perishable data on wind-and surge-induced residential building damage during hurricane Harvey (TX)," 2018.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
