To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Seeking Neural Nuggets: Knowledge Transfer in Large Language Models from a Parametric Perspective" by Ming Zhong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss their empirical investigations and mention evaluations across four benchmarks. This suggests that specific datasets are used for these evaluations, prompting me to look for their names.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Grade School Math (GSM)**: This dataset is used to assess the reasoning capabilities of models, requiring them to solve math problems and produce a chain-of-thought process.

2. **Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU)**: This dataset encompasses questions across 57 subjects, formatted as multiple-choice questions, and is used to measure the professional knowledge of language models.

3. **Super Natural Instructions (Super NI)**: This dataset consists of 1,616 varied NLP tasks along with their expert-written instructions, used to evaluate instruction-driven NLP tasks.

4. **AlpacaFarm**: This dataset contains 805 instructions from various evaluations, used to assess open-ended conversation capabilities.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
