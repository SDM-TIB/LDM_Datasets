To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SSR: SAM is a Strong Regularizer for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation" by Yanqi Ge et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method was evaluated on the **GTA5→Cityscapes** benchmark, which indicates that these datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of semantic segmentation and mention traditional benchmark datasets like **VOC2012**, **Cityscapes**, and **COCOStuff**. This suggests that these datasets are relevant to their work, but I need to confirm their specific use in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention using the **GTA5** dataset and the **Cityscapes** dataset for their evaluations. They describe **GTA5** as being collected from an open-world action game and **Cityscapes** as a real-world urban dataset from European cities. This confirms that both datasets are integral to their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **GTA5 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Richter, S. R., Vineet, V., Roth, S., & Koltun, V. (2016). *Playing for data: Ground truth from computer games*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2016: 14th European Conference, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, October 11-14, 2016, Proceedings, Part II 14. Springer, 2016, pp. 102–118.

2. For the **Cityscapes dataset**, the citation is:
   > Cordts, M., Omran, M., Ramos, S., Rehfeld, T., & Schmid, C. (2016). *The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
