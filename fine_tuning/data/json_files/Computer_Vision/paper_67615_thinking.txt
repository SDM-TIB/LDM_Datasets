To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WaterHE-NeRF: Water-ray Tracing Neural Radiance Fields for Underwater Scene Reconstruction" by Jingchun Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on real underwater datasets and synthetic datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets utilized in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **UWBundle Dataset**: This dataset is an open-source collection of images compiled in a controlled setup at the University of Michigan’s Marine Hydrodynamics Laboratory. It is designed to validate the efficacy of their method in real-world underwater conditions.

2. **LLFF-Water Dataset**: This is a synthetic underwater dataset derived from the LLFF framework. The authors explain that it simulates underwater conditions by setting specific water parameters to closely mimic real underwater environments.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **UWBundle Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Katherine A Skinner, Eduardo Iscar, and Matthew Johnson-Roberson. *Automatic color correction for 3D reconstruction of underwater scenes*. In 2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pages 5140–5147. IEEE, 2017.

- For the **LLFF-Water Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P Srinivasan, Rodrigo Ortiz-Cayon, Nima Khademi Kalantari, Ravi Ramamoorthi, Ren Ng, and Abhishek Kar. *Local light field fusion: Practical view synthesis with prescriptive sampling guidelines*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 38(4):1–14, 2019.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this data into the required format for further processing or review.
