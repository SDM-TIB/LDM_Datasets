To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DiffCAD: Weakly-Supervised Probabilistic CAD Model Retrieval and Alignment from an RGB Image" by Daoyi Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions that the approach is evaluated on real-world datasets, which suggests that there are specific datasets used for validation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention using **ScanNet** and **ARKit** datasets for validation. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics.

1. **ScanNet Dataset**: The authors refer to ScanNet as a richly annotated 3D reconstruction dataset. They mention that it contains images and annotations for various indoor scenes, which are crucial for their experiments. The specific reference to ScanNet is:
   > Dai, A., Chang, A. X., Savva, M., Halber, M., Funkhouser, T., & Nießner, M. (2017). ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (CVPR), 5828–5839.

2. **ARKit Dataset**: The authors also mention using the ARKit dataset, which is a diverse real-world dataset for 3D indoor scene understanding. The reference for ARKit is:
   > Baruch, D., Chen, Z., Dehghan, A., Dimry, T., Feigin, Y., Fu, P., Gebauer, T., Joffe, B., Kurz, D., Schwartz, A., & Shulman, E. (2021). ARKitScenes - A Diverse Real-World Dataset for 3D Indoor Scene Understanding Using Mobile RGB-D Data. In Thirty-fifth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track (Round 1). https://openreview.net/forum?id=tjZjv_qh_CE

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their full citations as they are critical for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for easy access and review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately for future reference or analysis.
