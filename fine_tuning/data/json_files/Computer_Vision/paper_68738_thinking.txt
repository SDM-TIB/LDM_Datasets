To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Validation and Comparison of Non-Stationary Cognitive Models: A Diffusion Model Application," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may include references to datasets used for validation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, potentially naming specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **materials and methods** section, as this part typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

Following that, I will check the **results** and **discussion** sections. These sections may provide additional context about how the datasets were utilized in the analysis and any comparisons made between them.

I will also review the **references** section to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Based on my review, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **Color Discrimination Task Dataset**: This dataset is used in the experiments to assess the performance of the non-stationary diffusion decision models. It includes data from 14 participants who completed 800 trials, with variations in task difficulty and instructions regarding speed or accuracy.

2. **Synthetic Datasets for Model Comparison**: The authors mention generating synthetic datasets to train and validate their models. These datasets are crucial for the Bayesian model comparison methods employed in the study.

Next, I will compile the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Color Discrimination Task Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Schumacher, L., Schnuerch, M., Voss, A., & Radev, S. T. (2023). Validation and Comparison of Non-Stationary Cognitive Models: A Diffusion Model Application. *Journal of Experimental Psychology: General*.

- For the **Synthetic Datasets**, the citation is:
  > Radev, S. T., Schmitt, M., Schumacher, L., Elsemüller, L., Pratz, V., Schälte, Y., Kothe, U., & Bürkner, P.-C. (2023). BayesFlow: Amortized Bayesian Workflows With Neural Networks. *Journal of Open Source Software*, 8(89), 5702. DOI: 10.21105/joss.05702.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
