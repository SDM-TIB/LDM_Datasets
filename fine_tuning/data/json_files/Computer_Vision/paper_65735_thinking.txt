To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Wasserstein Gradient Flow over Variational Parameter Space for Variational Inference" by Dai Hai Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and it may mention the datasets used for validation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where authors detail the datasets they used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics (such as the number of samples, dimensions, or specific characteristics).

In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on **synthetic and real-world datasets**. I will need to find the specific names of these datasets. 

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: The authors describe a synthetic dataset used to validate their methods, but they do not provide a specific citation or detailed reference for this dataset. I will note that this dataset is synthetic and does not have a formal citation.

2. **Australian Dataset**: This dataset is described as having 790 examples and 14 dimensions, with 345 examples used for training. The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, but it is commonly known in the machine learning community.

3. **Boston Dataset**: This dataset consists of 506 examples and 8 dimensions, with 455 examples used for training. Similar to the Australian dataset, it is widely recognized and does not have a specific citation provided in the paper.

4. **Concrete Dataset**: This dataset contains 1030 examples and 13 dimensions, with 927 examples used for training. Again, it is a well-known dataset in the field, but no specific citation is provided.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the datasets have associated citations. However, since the Australian, Boston, and Concrete datasets are standard datasets in the field, I will provide their commonly accepted citations:

- For the **Australian Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gal, Y., & Ghahramani, Z. (2016). Dropout as a Bayesian approximation: Representing model uncertainty in deep learning. In International Conference on Machine Learning (pp. 1050-1059). PMLR.

- For the **Boston Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Harrison, D. & Rubinfeld, D. L. (1978). Hedonic housing prices and the demand for clean air. *Journal of Environmental Economics and Management*, 5(1), 81-102.

- For the **Concrete Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yeh, I. C. (1998). Modeling of strength of high-performance concrete using artificial neural networks. *Cement and Concrete Research*, 28(12), 1797-1808.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the known datasets while noting that the synthetic dataset does not have a formal citation.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation where applicable.
