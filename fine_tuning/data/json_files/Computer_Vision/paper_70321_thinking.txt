To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DiffSF: Diffusion Models for Scene Flow Estimation" by Yushan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of "standard scene flow estimation benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.3 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **FlyingThings3D**: This is a synthetic dataset consisting of 25,000 scenes with ground truth annotations. The authors specify that it is preprocessed into two versions: F3Do (with occlusions) and F3Ds (without occlusions), detailing the number of scenes for training and testing.

2. **KITTI**: This dataset is described as a real autonomous driving dataset containing 200 scenes for both training and testing. The authors also mention its preprocessing into KITTIo (with occlusions) and KITTIs (without occlusions), along with the number of scenes used in each version.

3. **Waymo-Open**: This is a larger autonomous driving dataset with challenging scenes, consisting of 798 training sequences and 202 testing sequences. The authors note that the annotations are generated from tracked 3D objects.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **FlyingThings3D**, the citation is:
  > Mayer, N., Ilg, E., Hausser, P., Fischer, P., Cremers, D., Dosovitskiy, A., & Brox, T. (2016). *A large dataset to train convolutional networks for disparity, optical flow, and scene flow estimation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 4040–4048.

- For **KITTI**, the citation is:
  > Menze, M., & Geiger, A. (2015). *Object scene flow for autonomous vehicles*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 3061–3070.

- For **Waymo-Open**, the citation is:
  > Sun, P., Kretzschmar, H., Dotiwalla, X., Chouard, A., Patnaik, V., Tsui, P., Guo, J., Zhou, Y., Chai, Y., Caine, B., et al. (2020). *Scalability in perception for autonomous driving: Waymo open dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 2446–2454.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
