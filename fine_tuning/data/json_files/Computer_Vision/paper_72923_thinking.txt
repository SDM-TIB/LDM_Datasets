To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DiffTF++: 3D-aware Diffusion Transformer for Large-Vocabulary 3D Generation" by Ziang Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on **ShapeNet** and **OmniObject3D**, indicating that these are the datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. Here, the authors describe their evaluation process and confirm that they used **ShapeNet**, which contains 6770 objects across various categories, and **OmniObject3D**, which includes 216 categories of 3D objects with complex geometry and texture.

In the **implementation details section**, the authors provide additional context about how they processed the data from these datasets, including rendering multi-view images from the objects in **ShapeNet** and **OmniObject3D**. This reinforces that these datasets are central to their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **ShapeNet**: The citation is:
   > A. X. Chang, T. Funkhouser, L. Guibas, P. Hanrahan, Q. Huang, Z. Li, S. Savarese, M. Savva, S. Song, H. Su et al. *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

2. **OmniObject3D**: The citation is:
   > T. Wu, J. Zhang, X. Fu, Y. Wang, J. Ren, L. Pan, W. Wu, L. Yang, J. Wang, C. Qian et al. *OmniObject3D: Large-vocabulary 3D object dataset for realistic perception, reconstruction and generation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2301.07525, 2023.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **ShapeNet**: A comprehensive dataset containing 6770 3D objects across various categories, used for evaluating 3D generation methods.
- **OmniObject3D**: A large-vocabulary dataset consisting of 216 categories of 3D objects, designed for testing the generalization capabilities of 3D generation models.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation.
