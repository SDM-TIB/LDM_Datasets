To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Asymptotic behavior of an epidemic model with infinitely many variants" by Jean-Baptiste Burie, Arnaud Ducrot, and Quentin Griette, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data availability sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, but it discusses the dynamics of an epidemic model, which may imply the use of numerical simulations or theoretical data.

Next, I will examine the **main results section** and the **examples section** for any references to datasets used in the simulations or analyses. The authors discuss various models and their behaviors, but they do not specify any datasets in these sections.

In the **data availability section**, the authors state: "Data sharing not applicable to this article as no datasets were analyzed during the current study." This indicates that the authors did not use any external datasets for their research, which is crucial information.

Since there are no datasets mentioned or referenced in the paper, I will note that there are no datasets to extract. 

Finally, I will compile my findings into a structured format, ensuring to include the citation for the paper itself, as it is important to reference the source of the information.

The citation for the paper is:
> Jean-Baptiste Burie, Arnaud Ducrot, and Quentin Griette. *Asymptotic behavior of an epidemic model with infinitely many variants*. May 11, 2023.

In conclusion, I will summarize that no datasets were utilized in this research paper, and I will provide the citation for the paper as required.
