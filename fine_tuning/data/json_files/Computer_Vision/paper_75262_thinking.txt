To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Bellman equations for continuous-time policy evaluation I: discretization and approximation" by Wenlong Mou and Yuhua Zhu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics (e.g., size, type, and source).

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will examine it closely for detailed descriptions of each dataset used in the research. This section often contains the most comprehensive information about the datasets, including how they were collected, their characteristics, and their relevance to the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I note the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

If the paper discusses any datasets that are not original but are widely used in the field, I will look for their established citations in the references section as well.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the citation formatted correctly.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets mentioned in the paper.
