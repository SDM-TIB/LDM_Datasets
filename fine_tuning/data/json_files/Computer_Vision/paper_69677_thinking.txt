To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ComFusion: Personalized Subject Generation in Multiple Specific Scenes From Single Image" by Yan Hong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions advancements in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models and hints at the use of datasets for evaluation. The introduction elaborates on the personalization of T2I models, which suggests that datasets are crucial for the experiments discussed.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention using a combined dataset of the TI dataset and the DreamBooth dataset. I will note the details provided about these datasets.

1. **TI Dataset**: The paper references the TI dataset, which is used for personalizing text-to-image generation. I will need to find the full citation for this dataset in the references section.

2. **DreamBooth Dataset**: The authors also mention the DreamBooth dataset, which consists of 20 concepts. I will similarly look for its full citation in the references section.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to retrieve the complete citations for both datasets:

- For the **TI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Rinon Gal, Yuval Alaluf, Yuval Atzmon, Or Patashnik, Amit Haim Bermano, Gal Chechik, and Daniel Cohen-or. *An image is worth one word: Personalizing text-to-image generation using textual inversion*. In The Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations, 2022.

- For the **DreamBooth dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nataniel Ruiz, Yuanzhen Li, Varun Jampani, Yael Pritch, Michael Rubinstein, and Kfir Aberman. *Dreambooth: Fine tuning text-to-image diffusion models for subject-driven generation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 22500â€“22510, 2023.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
