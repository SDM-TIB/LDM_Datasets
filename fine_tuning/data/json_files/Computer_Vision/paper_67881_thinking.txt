To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Invariant Learning with Subgraph Co-mixup for Out-Of-Distribution Generalization" by Tianrui Jia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. They specifically mention using **three artificially synthesized datasets** and **nine real-world datasets**. I will look for the names of these datasets and any relevant details provided.

In the **experiments section**, the authors list the datasets used for their experiments:
1. **SPMotif**: This dataset is used to evaluate the method on structure and degree shifts.
2. **Graph-SST5**: A dataset used for degree shift evaluation.
3. **Graph-Twitter**: Another dataset used for degree shift evaluation.
4. **PROTEINS**: A dataset from the TU benchmarks used for size shift evaluation.
5. **DD**: Another dataset from the TU benchmarks for size shift evaluation.
6. **DrugOOD**: This dataset is used for structural distribution shifts.
7. **Open Graph Benchmark (OGB)**: A dataset used for structural distribution shifts.
8. **BACE**: A dataset mentioned in the context of structural shifts.
9. **BBBP**: Another dataset mentioned for structural shifts.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations may not always be explicitly listed for datasets, but I will look for any papers or sources that describe these datasets.

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations based on the information provided in the paper and any relevant references:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
