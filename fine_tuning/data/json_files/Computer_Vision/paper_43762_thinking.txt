To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VirTex: Learning Visual Representations from Textual Annotations" by Karan Desai and Justin Johnson, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their models on the **COCO Captions dataset**, which is a strong lead for a dataset.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** where the authors discuss their evaluation methods. In section 4, they mention using the **COCO Captions dataset** for training their models. This dataset is described as containing 118K images with five captions each, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's scale and purpose.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **related work** or **experiments** sections. The authors reference the **YFCC-100M dataset** and **JFT-300M dataset** in the context of weakly supervised learning, but these are not the primary datasets used in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, they specifically evaluate their model on downstream tasks using the **PASCAL VOC** and **ImageNet-1k** datasets. These datasets are important for understanding the performance of their model in various tasks.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **COCO Captions**:
   > Xinlei Chen, Hao Fang, Tsung-Yi Lin, Ramakrishna Vedantam, Saurabh Gupta, Piotr DollÃ¡r, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO captions: Data collection and evaluation server*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.00325, 2015.

2. **PASCAL VOC**:
   > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher K. I. Williams, John M. Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 2009.

3. **ImageNet-1k**:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 2015.

4. **YFCC-100M**:
   > Bart Thomee, David A Shamma, Gerald Friedland, Benjamin Elizalde, Karl Ni, Douglas Poland, Damian Borth, and Li-Jia Li. *YFCC100M: The new data in multimedia research*. Communications of the ACM, 2016.

5. **JFT-300M**:
   > Chen Sun, Abhinav Shrivastava, Saurabh Singh, and Abhinav Gupta. *Revisiting unreasonable effectiveness of data in deep learning era*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2017.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations for further processing or review. This structured approach will help in maintaining clarity and completeness in the dataset extraction process.
