To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Recurrent Neural Networks for Acoustic Modelling" by William Chan and Ian Lane, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention achieving a Word Error Rate (WER) on the **Wall Street Journal (WSJ) eval92 task**, which indicates that this dataset is used in their experiments. This is a strong lead for identifying a dataset.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to gather more details about the datasets used. In section 4, the authors explicitly state that they experiment with the **WSJ dataset**, specifically mentioning the subsets **si284** for training, **dev93** for development, and **eval92** for testing. This confirms that the WSJ dataset is central to their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the WSJ dataset. The WSJ dataset is commonly referenced in speech recognition literature, and I will look for its citation in the references provided. 

The citation for the **Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus** is typically attributed to:
> P. Godfrey, D. Holliman, and J. McDaniel. *SWB: The Switchboard Corpus of Conversational Speech*. Linguistic Data Consortium, 1992.

Since the authors do not mention any other datasets in the paper, I will conclude that the WSJ dataset is the only dataset they utilized for their experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the WSJ dataset as required. This will allow me to present a clear and complete summary of the datasets used in the research paper.
