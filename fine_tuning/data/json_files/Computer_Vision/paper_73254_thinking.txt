To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Physics-informed Score-based Diffusion Model for Limited-angle Reconstruction of Cardiac Computed Tomography" by Shuo Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for experiments or simulations.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of cardiac computed tomography (CT) and the challenges associated with limited-angle data acquisition. They may reference datasets used in their research, so I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection on dataset preparation. Here, the authors describe the datasets used for their numerical simulations and evaluations. They mention using the **4D Extended Cardiac-Torso (XCAT) phantom version 2** to generate cardiac CT phantom data. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed method.

Additionally, the authors reference the **Stanford AIMI COCA dataset**, which consists of 789 gated CT scans from individual patients. This dataset is significant for evaluating the clinical applicability of their method.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **4D Extended Cardiac-Torso (XCAT) phantom version 2**:

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
