To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gated Temporal Diffusion for Stochastic Long-Term Dense Anticipation" by Olga Zatsarynna et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on three datasets: **Breakfast, Assembly101, and 50Salads**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the evaluation of the proposed method.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, I will look for specific information about each dataset, including the number of videos, types of actions, and any unique characteristics that are mentioned.

In Section 5.1, the authors describe the datasets as follows:

1. **Breakfast Dataset**: This dataset contains 1,712 videos of actors preparing 10 different breakfast-related dishes, with actions annotated from 48 classes. The average video length is 2.3 minutes, and the anticipation duration can be up to 5.4 minutes.

2. **Assembly101 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 4,321 videos of toy vehicle assembly and disassembly, annotated with 100,000 coarse action segments from 202 classes. The videos can last up to 25 minutes, with anticipation durations reaching 12.5 minutes.

3. **50Salads Dataset**: This dataset includes 50 videos of salad preparation, with dense annotations for 17 fine-grained actions. The average video length is 6.4 minutes, and the anticipation duration can be up to 5.1 minutes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Breakfast Dataset**:
  > Kuehne, H., Arslan, A., & Serre, T. (2014). *The language of actions: Recovering the syntax and semantics of goal-directed human activities*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For the **Assembly101 Dataset**:
  > Sener, F., Chatterjee, D., Shelepov, D., He, K., Singhania, D., Wang, R., & Yao, A. (2022). *Assembly101: A large-scale multi-view video dataset for understanding procedural activities*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For the **50Salads Dataset**:
  > Stein, S., & McKenna, S.J. (2013). *Combining embedded accelerometers with computer vision for recognizing food preparation activities*. ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets and their citations accurately. I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
