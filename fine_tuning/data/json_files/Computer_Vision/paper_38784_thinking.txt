To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Graph Pooling and Hybrid Convolutional Operations for Text Representations" by Hongyang Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors discuss their experimental results, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look closely at the **Datasets section** (Section 4.1) of the paper, where the authors summarize the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they list four datasets:

1. **AG’s News**: A news dataset containing 120,000 training samples and 7,600 testing samples, classified into 4 categories.
2. **DBPedia**: A dataset derived from Wikipedia articles, containing 560,000 training samples and 70,000 testing samples, classified into 14 ontology classes.
3. **Yelp Polarity**: A dataset from the Yelp Dataset Challenge with 560,000 training samples and 38,000 testing samples, used for binary sentiment classification.
4. **Yelp Full**: Another dataset from the Yelp Dataset Challenge, containing 650,000 training samples and 50,000 testing samples, used for multi-class sentiment classification.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluating their proposed methods, which reinforces the relevance of the datasets mentioned.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and should be included in the dataset descriptions. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **AG’s News**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, X., Zhao, J., & LeCun, Y. (2015). Character-level convolutional networks for text classification. In Advances in neural information processing systems (pp. 649–657).

- For **DBPedia**, the citation is:
  > Lehmann, J., Isele, R., Jakob, M., Jentzsch, A., Kontokostas, D., Mendes, P. N., ... & Auer, S. (2015). DBpedia–a large-scale, multilingual knowledge base extracted from Wikipedia. Semantic Web, 6(2), 167–195.

- For **Yelp Polarity**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, X., Zhao, J., & LeCun, Y. (2015). Character-level convolutional networks for text classification. In Advances in neural information processing systems (pp. 649–657).

- For **Yelp Full**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, X., Zhao, J., & LeCun, Y. (2015). Character-level convolutional networks for text classification. In Advances in neural information processing systems (pp. 649–657).

Although the Yelp datasets are derived from the same source, they are treated as separate datasets in the context of the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all necessary information for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
