To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Unified Transformer-based Network for Multimodal Emotion Recognition" by Kamran Ali and Charles E. Hughes, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on the **MAHNOB-HCI** and **DEAP** datasets, indicating that these are the primary datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In the **Experimental Details section**, the authors provide a description of both datasets:

1. **MAHNOB-HCI Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 527 facial video recordings of 27 participants, along with physiological signals such as EEG and ECG. The ECG signals were sampled at a rate of 256 Hz and are synchronized with the facial video recordings.

2. **DEAP Dataset**: The DEAP dataset is noted for containing data from 32 participants who were recorded while watching 40 one-minute music videos. Participants evaluated each video on various emotional dimensions, including arousal and valence.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MAHNOB-HCI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Soleymani, Mohammad, Jeroen Lichtenauer, Thierry Pun, and Maja Pantic. "A multimodal database for affect recognition and implicit tagging." *IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing* 3, no. 1 (2011): 42-55.

- For the **DEAP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Koelstra, Sander, Christian Muhl, Mohammad Soleymani, Jong-Seok Lee, Ashkan Yazdani, Touradj Ebrahimi, Thierry Pun, Anton Nijholt, and Ioannis Patras. "DEAP: A database for emotion analysis using physiological signals." *IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing* 3, no. 1 (2011): 18-31.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
