To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating the Robustness of Conversational Recommender Systems by Adversarial Examples" by Ali Montazeralghaem and James Allan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on two datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **OpenDialKG**: This dataset is described as an open-ended dialog with knowledge graph corpus, specifically for the recommendation task. It contains 13,802 human-to-human role-playing dialogs with 91,209 utterances.

2. **REDIAL**: This dataset is constructed through Amazon Mechanical Turk and consists of conversations for recommendations on movies. It contains 10,006 conversations with 182,150 utterances related to 51,699 movies.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper:

- For **OpenDialKG**, the citation is:
  > Suranjana Moon, Pararth Shah, Anuj Kumar, and Rajen Subba. *OpenDialKG: Explainable Conversational Reasoning with Attention-Based Walks over Knowledge Graphs*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 845–854, 2019.

- For **REDIAL**, the citation is:
  > Raymond Li, Samira Ebrahimi Kahou, Hannes Schulz, Vincent Michalski, Laurent Charlin, and Chris Pal. *Towards Deep Conversational Recommendations*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 9725–9735, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I have extracted the following datasets from the paper:

1. **OpenDialKG**
   - Citation: Suranjana Moon, Pararth Shah, Anuj Kumar, and Rajen Subba. *OpenDialKG: Explainable Conversational Reasoning with Attention-Based Walks over Knowledge Graphs*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 845–854, 2019.

2. **REDIAL**
   - Citation: Raymond Li, Samira Ebrahimi Kahou, Hannes Schulz, Vincent Michalski, Laurent Charlin, and Chris Pal. *Towards Deep Conversational Recommendations*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 9725–9735, 2018.

With this information, I am ready to format the dataset entries as needed for further processing or analysis.
