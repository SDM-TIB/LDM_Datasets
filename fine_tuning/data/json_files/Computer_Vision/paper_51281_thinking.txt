To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Global Financial Cycle, Commodity Terms of Trade and Financial Spreads in Emerging Markets and Developing Economies" by Jorge E. Carrera et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data description sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on the global financial cycle and its effects on emerging and developing economies, but it does not specify datasets. The introduction discusses the context and significance of the research but does not name specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data description)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the study. In this section, the authors describe their quarterly panel database, which includes data for **33 emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs)** from **1999:Q1 to 2020:Q4**. They mention several variables and their sources, which are crucial for understanding the datasets utilized in their analysis.

The key datasets identified in this section include:

1. **COMTRADE Data**: This dataset is used to classify countries as net exporters or net importers based on their commodity trade balance. The authors reference the criteria from Bastourre et al. (2015) for this classification.

2. **JP Morgan EMBI Global Sovereign Spread Index**: This dataset is used to measure financial spreads (FS) and is extracted from Bloomberg and The Global Economic Monitor.

3. **IMF Primary Commodity Price System**: This dataset provides the commodity price index used in the analysis.

4. **CTOT Database**: The authors utilize two indicators from this database to measure commodity terms of trade (CTOT1 and CTOT2), which are country-specific and time-varying.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets:

- For **COMTRADE Data**, the citation is:
  > United Nations. *COMTRADE Database*. Available at: https://comtrade.un.org/

- For **JP Morgan EMBI Global Sovereign Spread Index**, the citation is:
  > JP Morgan. *Emerging Markets Bond Index (EMBI)*. Available at: https://www.jpmorgan.com/solutions/research/emerging-markets-bond-index

- For **IMF Primary Commodity Price System**, the citation is:
  > International Monetary Fund. *Primary Commodity Prices*. Available at: https://www.imf.org/external/np/res/commod/index.aspx

- For **CTOT Database**, the citation is:
  > Gruss, J. and Kebhaj, S. (2019). *Commodity Terms of Trade Database*. International Monetary Fund.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
