To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Im2win: Memory Efficient Convolution On SIMD Architectures" by Shuai Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the im2win algorithm and its performance improvements, but it does not mention any specific datasets. The introduction also focuses on convolution operations and does not provide any dataset information.

Next, I will examine the **experimental results** section, as this is typically where datasets are discussed in relation to the experiments conducted. I will look for any references to datasets used for benchmarking the proposed algorithms. 

Upon reviewing the **experimental setup** section, I notice that the authors mention using a benchmark containing twelve unique convolution layers, but they do not specify any datasets directly. Instead, they refer to convolutional layers from well-known deep neural networks (DNNs) like VGG-16 and ResNet-50. 

To ensure I capture all relevant information, I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited there. However, the references primarily focus on previous works and do not provide specific datasets used in the experiments.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will note that while the authors reference convolutional layers from established models, they do not provide specific datasets for training or evaluation. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

In summary, I will document my findings as follows:

1. **No specific datasets were mentioned in the paper.**
2. **The authors referenced convolutional layers from VGG-16 and ResNet-50, but did not provide dataset citations.**

Since there are no datasets to cite, I will not create any dataset entries or citations. This process highlights the importance of thoroughly reviewing all sections of a research paper to identify relevant datasets, even when they may not be explicitly stated.
