To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Semi-Supervised Framework for Misinformation Detection" by Yueyang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their framework on two sets of Covid-related Twitter data, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Evaluation)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Data Set 1**: This dataset was collected in-house and consists of a curated subset of tweets from 282,201 Twitter users in Canada. It includes 280 reliable and 280 unreliable tweets, with an additional 1,040 unlabeled samples. The authors provide a detailed description of how this dataset was created, including the method of collection and the time frame.

2. **Data Set 2**: This dataset is the COVID-19 Fake News Dataset, which includes 10,700 social media posts and articles of real and fake news on Covid-19. The authors selected 6,000 samples (3,000 true news and 3,000 fake news) for their experiments, along with a testing set created from this data.

I will now look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Data Set 1**, the citation is:
  > Boukouvalas, Z., Mallinson, C., Crothers, E., Japkowicz, N., Piplai, A., Mittal, S., Joshi, A., and AdalÄ±, T. *Independent Component Analysis for Trustworthy Cyberspace during High Impact Events: An Application to Covid-19*. arXiv:2006.01284 [cs, stat] (June 2020).

- For **Data Set 2**, the citation is:
  > Patwa, P., Bhardwaj, M., Guptha, V., Kumari, G., Sharma, S., PYKL, S., Das, A., Ekbal, A., Akhtar, S., and Chakraborty, T. *Overview of constraint 2021 shared tasks: Detecting English Covid-19 fake news and Hindi hostile posts*. In Proceedings of the First Workshop on Combating Online Hostile Posts in Regional Languages during Emergency Situation (CONSTRAINT) (2021), Springer.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
