To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Planet Scale Spatial-Temporal Knowledge Graph Based On OpenStreetMap And H3 Grid" by Martin BÃ¶ckling et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data as a foundational element for constructing a Spatial-Temporal Knowledge Graph (STKG). This indicates that OSM is a primary dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** and **data preparation** sections. In section 5.1, the authors describe their use of OSM data files from Geofabrik, specifically the .osm.pbf files, which are essential for their STKG construction. They also mention that these files represent data from various regions and years, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope.

In section 5.4, the authors provide statistics about the constructed STKG, indicating that they used OSM data from the years 2018 to 2024, resulting in a total of 529,065,633 distinct OSM elements. This information is vital for documenting the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the OpenStreetMap dataset. The citation for OpenStreetMap is as follows:
> OpenStreetMap contributors, OpenStreetMap, 2024. URL: https://www.openstreetmap.org/about.

Additionally, I will note that the authors reference Geofabrik as the source for their OSM data. Geofabrik provides OSM data extracts in various formats, which is relevant for understanding the dataset's availability.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets identified:
1. **OpenStreetMap Data**: This dataset serves as the foundation for the STKG and includes various geographical entities and metadata. The data is sourced from Geofabrik and spans multiple years (2018-2024).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
