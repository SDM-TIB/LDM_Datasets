To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Strategies for CT Reconstruction using Diffusion Posterior Sampling with a Nonlinear Model" by Xiao Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions a dataset constructed based on the public CT Lymph Nodes dataset, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract. I will note this down for further investigation.

Next, I will look into the **methodology section**, particularly the part where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. In the paper, they mention that the dataset contains torso CT scans of 150 patients, from which they extracted slices to form a chest CT dataset of 30,000 slices, each with dimensions of 512 × 512 pixels. This detailed description will help me summarize the dataset effectively.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors provide further context about the dataset's use in their experiments. However, it appears that the primary dataset discussed is the CT Lymph Nodes dataset.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the CT Lymph Nodes dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

> H. R. Roth, L. Lu, A. Seff, K. M. Cherry, J. Hoffman, S. Wang, J. Liu, E. Turkbey, and R. M. Summers. *A new 2.5D representation for lymph node detection using random sets of deep convolutional neural network observations*. In Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention–MICCAI 2014: 17th International Conference, Boston, MA, USA, September 14-18, 2014, Proceedings, Part I 17. Springer, 2014, pp. 520–527.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extracted from the paper:

1. **CT Lymph Nodes Dataset**: This dataset contains torso CT scans of 150 patients, from which 30,000 slices of 512 × 512 pixels are extracted for training and evaluation purposes.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with its citation into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their corresponding citations as required.
