To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Lifelong Learning Strategy: Self-Memory Supervising and Dynamically Growing Process" by Youcheng Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions that the authors verified their methods on **MNIST and Fashion-MNIST**, which indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for the research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss their evaluation methods. They specifically mention using the **MNIST dataset** and the **Fashion-MNIST dataset** for their experiments. The authors describe MNIST as a single-pattern dataset and Fashion-MNIST as a multi-pattern dataset, which provides context for their use in the research.

In the **References section**, I will find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. URL: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For **Fashion-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. CoRR, abs/1708.07747, 2017. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07747

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as it is crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
