To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Text Modality Oriented Image Feature Extraction for Detecting Diffusion-based DeepFake" by Di Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will pay particular attention to **section 5 (Experiment)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention using the **DIRE dataset**, which contains images generated from ten different diffusion types for evaluating their proposed method.

I will then look for any additional details about the dataset, such as its size, the types of images it contains, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study. The paper states that the DIRE dataset includes images generated by various diffusion models, specifically mentioning types like ADM, DDPM, IDDPM, and others.

After identifying the dataset, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DIRE dataset. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the dataset. The paper cites the following reference for the DIRE dataset:

- Z. Wang et al. "DIRE for diffusion-generated image detection," in Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, 2023, pp. 22 445â€“22 455.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **DIRE Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed feature extraction method for detecting diffusion-based DeepFakes. It contains images generated from ten different diffusion types, providing a comprehensive basis for testing the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset details along with the full citation, ensuring that all necessary information is included for future reference or use.
