To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic Segmentation for Point Cloud Scenes via Dilated Graph Feature Aggregation and Pyramid Decoders" by Yongqiang Mao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on **S3DIS, ShapeNetPart, and Toronto-3D**, which suggests these are the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **Datasets section** of the paper. In the experiments section, the authors explicitly mention:

1. **S3DIS (Stanford Large-Scale 3D Indoor Spaces)**: This dataset consists of 3D RGB point clouds collected from 271 rooms. The authors specify that they follow PointNet++ for evaluation, using Area-5 as the testing set.

2. **ShapeNetPart**: This dataset contains 16,881 models divided into 16 categories, with 50 parts annotated. The authors mention that 2048 points are sampled from each shape for the segmentation task.

3. **Toronto-3D**: This dataset is collected from a region in Toronto and is divided into 4 areas, with L002 designated as the testing set.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **S3DIS**, the citation is:

- For **ShapeNetPart**, the citation is:

- For **Toronto-3D**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
