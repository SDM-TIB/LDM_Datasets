To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Latent Representations of Bank Customers With The Variational Autoencoder" by Rogelio A. Mancisidora et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 5)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, the authors mention using three datasets: 

1. **Norwegian car loan dataset**: This dataset contains 187,069 cases and includes various features related to applicants' financial and demographic factors. 

2. **Finnish car loan dataset**: This dataset consists of 115,899 cases and similarly includes financial and demographic features.

3. **Kaggle dataset "Give Me Some Credit"**: This public dataset has 150,000 cases and is used for credit scoring.

I will also check the **data description subsection (Section 5.1)** for more details about each dataset, including the number of cases and features, which will help in providing a comprehensive description.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The paper may not provide direct citations for the datasets, especially for proprietary datasets like the Norwegian and Finnish car loan datasets. However, I will ensure to document the Kaggle dataset citation properly.

For the **Kaggle dataset**, the citation is:
> "Give Me Some Credit" dataset. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit

For the **Norwegian car loan dataset** and **Finnish car loan dataset**, since they are proprietary datasets provided by Santander Consumer Bank, I will note that they are used in the research but may not have formal citations available.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the names, descriptions, and citations (where applicable) in a structured format for clarity and completeness.
