To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Recommend Frame for Interactive Video Object Segmentation in the Wild" by Zhaoyuan Yin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on public datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In **section 4.1 (Dataset and Evaluation Metrics)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **DAVIS Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 60 training sequences and 30 validation sequences, providing high-quality densely-annotated segmentation mask annotations for each frame.

2. **YouTube-VOS Dataset**: The authors mention that they sampled 50 sequences from this dataset, which does not contain applicable annotations for the interactive VOS task, but they extended it with initial scribbles.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **DAVIS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Federico Perazzi, Jordi Pont-Tuset, Brian McWilliams, Luc Van Gool, Markus Gross, and Alexander Sorkine-Hornung. *A benchmark dataset and evaluation methodology for video object segmentation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 724–732, 2016.

- For the **YouTube-VOS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ning Xu, Linjie Yang, Yuchen Fan, Jianchao Yang, Dingcheng Yue, Yuchen Liang, Brian Price, Scott Cohen, and Thomas Huang. *Youtube-vos: Sequence-to-sequence video object segmentation*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 585–601, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will prepare me for any further processing or output generation needed.
