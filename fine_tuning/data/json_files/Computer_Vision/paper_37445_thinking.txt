To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Denoising Autoencoder with Modulated Lateral Connections Learns Invariant Representations of Natural Images" by Antti Rasmus and Tapani Raiko, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they conducted experiments using "natural image data" and refer to two specific datasets: **CIFAR-10** and a dataset referred to as **O&F** (Olshausen & Field dataset). This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 2) where the authors describe their methodology. They explicitly state that they used **16 × 16 patches from two image datasets: CIFAR-10** and **natural images used by Olshausen & Field (1996)**. This confirms the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.

2. For the **O&F dataset**, the citation is:
   > Bruno A. Olshausen and David J. Field. *Emergence of Simple-Cell Receptive Field Properties by Learning a Sparse Code for Natural Images*. Nature, 381:607–609, 1996.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, which is essential for proper attribution in any subsequent analysis or application.
