To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extended vehicle energy dataset (eVED): an enhanced large-scale dataset for deep learning on vehicle trip energy consumption" by Shiliang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract introduces the eVED dataset as an enhanced version of the Vehicle Energy Dataset (VED), which indicates that the VED is a key dataset in this research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. In this case, I will focus on the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as they often contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. The authors mention the eVED dataset and its enhancements, which include accurate GPS coordinates and various associated attributes.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference the original Vehicle Energy Dataset (VED) and its limitations, which leads me to confirm that the VED is a significant dataset in this context. They also mention that the eVED dataset is built upon the VED, indicating a direct relationship.

I will then check the **tables** and **figures** throughout the paper, particularly Table 1, which lists related open-source vehicle trip datasets. This table provides a comparative overview of various datasets, including their scale and features. I will extract the names and details of these datasets.

The key datasets identified in the paper are:

1. **Vehicle Energy Dataset (VED)**: This dataset serves as the foundation for the eVED dataset. It contains a large volume of vehicle driving records and pertinent features toward energy consumption.

2. **eVED Dataset**: This is the enhanced version of the VED, which includes additional attributes such as road speed limits, intersections, and GPS calibration.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For the **Vehicle Energy Dataset (VED)**:

- For the **eVED Dataset**:
  > Shiliang Zhang, Dyako Fatih, Fahmi Abdulqadir, Tobias Schwarz, and Xuehui Ma. "Extended vehicle energy dataset (eVED): an enhanced large-scale dataset for deep learning on vehicle trip energy consumption." *Chalmers University of Technology*, March 17, 2022. Available at: https://github.com/zhangsl2013/eVED.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and that the full citations are included for reference. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their details from the research paper effectively.
