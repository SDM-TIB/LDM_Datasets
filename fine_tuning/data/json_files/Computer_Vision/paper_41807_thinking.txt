To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Molecular Generative Model Based On Adversarially Regularized Autoencoder" by Seung Hwan Hong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to data used in experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may mention datasets used in previous studies or their own work. Here, I will look for any specific dataset names or descriptions.

In the **methods section**, I will pay close attention to any subsections that detail the datasets used for training and testing their model. This section typically provides the most comprehensive information about the datasets, including their sizes, types, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study.

In the **results section**, I will verify the datasets mentioned in the methods section and check if the authors provide any additional insights or metrics related to the datasets used. This will help confirm that I have accurately identified the datasets utilized in their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

From the paper, I have identified the following datasets:

1. **QM9 Dataset**: This dataset contains 133,885 small organic molecules with up to nine heavy atoms. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Ramakrishnan, R.; Dral, P. O.; Rupp, M.; Von Lilienfeld, O. A. *Quantum chemistry structures and properties of 134 kilo molecules*. Scientific data 2014, 1, 140022.

2. **ZINC Dataset**: This dataset consists of 249,455 molecules randomly selected from the drug-like subset of the ZINC database. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Irwin, J. J.; Sterling, T.; Mysinger, M. M.; Bolstad, E. S.; Coleman, R. G. *ZINC: a free tool to discover chemistry for biology*. Journal of chemical information and modeling 2012, 52, 1757â€“1768.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
