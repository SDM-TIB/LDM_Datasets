To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Faceted Representation Learning with Hybrid Architecture for Time Series Classification" by Zhenyu Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on a set of univariate time series benchmarks from the UCR repository, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Analyses)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. In **section 4.1 (Time Series Benchmark)**, they explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. The paper mentions that they conducted experiments on **24 time series benchmarks from the UCR repository**. I will note down the names of these datasets along with their details, such as the number of training and testing instances, sequence lengths, and the number of classes.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Car**
2. **Computers**
3. **FordA**
4. **FordB**
5. **HandOutlines**
6. **Haptics**
7. **Herring**
8. **InlineSkate**
9. **LargeKitApp**
10. **Lighting2**
11. **Mallat**
12. **NonECG1**
13. **NonECG2**
14. **OliveOil**
15. **Phoneme**
16. **RefDevices**
17. **ScreenType**
18. **ShapesAll**
19. **SmallKitApp**
20. **StarLCurves**
21. **Strawberry**
22. **uWavGestAll**
23. **Worms**
24. **WormsTwoClass**

Next, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. The UCR repository is a well-known source for time series datasets, and the paper likely cites the original source for these datasets. 

The citation for the UCR time series classification archive is:
> Eamonn Keogh, et al. "The UCR Time Series Classification Archive." 2015. Available at: www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data/.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their source, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, their characteristics, and the full citation for the UCR repository.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
