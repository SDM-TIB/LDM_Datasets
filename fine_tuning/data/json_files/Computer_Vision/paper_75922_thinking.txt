To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-driving lab discovers principles for steering spontaneous emission" by Saaketh Desai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, results, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets or experimental data.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets used in their experiments or any relevant data sources that support their claims. This section often provides context for the research and may highlight key datasets.

In the **results section**, I will look for any specific datasets that were used to validate the findings. The authors may describe experiments conducted with particular datasets, including any metrics or performance evaluations based on those datasets.

The **methods section** is crucial as it often details the experimental setup and may include information about the datasets used for training machine learning models or for conducting experiments. I will pay close attention to any references to datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and how they were utilized in the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For this paper, I anticipate that the authors may have used datasets related to spontaneous emission measurements, optical pump patterns, or other experimental data relevant to their findings. I will document each dataset with its full citation, ensuring that I capture all necessary details.

Once I have gathered all the relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
