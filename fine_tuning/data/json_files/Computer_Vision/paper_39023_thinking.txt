To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CFM-BD: a distributed rule induction algorithm for building Compact Fuzzy Models in Big Data classification problems" by Mikel Elkano et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental framework sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they conducted an empirical study using **6 Big Data classification problems available at UCI and OpenML repositories**. This indicates that datasets are indeed present, and I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look into **section IV (Experimental Framework)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They provide a table (Table I) that lists the datasets along with their characteristics, such as the number of instances, attributes, and classes. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **BNG (Big Neural Graph)**: 1,000,000 instances, 14 attributes, 2 classes.
2. **COV (Covertype)**: 581,012 instances, 54 attributes, 7 classes.
3. **HEPMASS**: 10,500,000 instances, 28 attributes, 2 classes.
4. **HIGGS**: 11,000,000 instances, 28 attributes, 5 classes.
5. **KDD (KDD Cup 1999)**: 4,898,431 instances, 41 attributes, 2 classes.
6. **SUSY**: 5,000,000 instances, 18 attributes, 2 classes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The authors may not provide specific citations for each dataset, but I can reference the UCI Machine Learning Repository and OpenML as sources for the datasets.

For example, the citation for the UCI Machine Learning Repository is:
> Lichman, M. (2013). UCI Machine Learning Repository. [Online]. Available: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml

And for OpenML, the citation is:
> OpenML. (n.d.). OpenML: A collaborative platform for machine learning. [Online]. Available: https://www.openml.org

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries along with their citations into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as required.
