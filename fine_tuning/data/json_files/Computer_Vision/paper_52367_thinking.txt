To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Depthwise Convolution for Multi-Agent Communication with Enhanced Mean-Field Approximation" by Donghan Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on two multi-agent tasks: the **adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC)** task and the **StarCraft II multi-agent challenge (SMAC)**. This indicates that datasets related to these tasks may be present.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the tasks and the environments in which they conducted their evaluations. I will focus on the descriptions of the ATSC and SMAC tasks to identify any datasets or benchmarks referenced.

For the **ATSC task**, the paper mentions that it uses the **SUMO platform** for simulation. I will check if there are any specific datasets or configurations mentioned that are used for this task.

For the **SMAC task**, I will look for details about the combat scenarios and any datasets or configurations that are used for training and evaluation. The paper provides information about the different combat scenarios, but I need to confirm if there are specific datasets associated with these scenarios.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide a complete context for each dataset.

1. **SUMO platform for ATSC**: The citation for the SUMO platform is:
   > M. Behrisch, L. Bieker, J. Erdmann, and D. Krajzewicz. *SUMOâ€“simulation of urban mobility: An overview*. In Proceedings of Advances in System Simulation, 2011.

2. **StarCraft II multi-agent challenge (SMAC)**: The citation for the SMAC is:
   > M. Samvelyan, T. Rashid, C. S. de Witt et al. *The StarCraft multi-agent challenge*. In Proceedings of International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly attributed in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
