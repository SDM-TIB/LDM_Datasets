To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Syndrome-aware Herb Recommendation with Multi-Graph Convolution Network" by Yuanyuan Jin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions conducting experiments on a **public TCM dataset**, which indicates that a specific dataset is used for the research.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors provide details about the dataset used for their experiments. They refer to the **TCM dataset** and provide statistics about it, including the number of prescriptions, symptoms, and herbs.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the TCM dataset. The authors reference a previous work that describes this dataset, which is crucial for providing the correct citation.

The relevant details I find are:
- The TCM dataset is described as containing **98,334 raw medical prescriptions** and **33,765 processed medical prescriptions**. It includes **360 symptoms** and **753 herbs**.

The citation for the TCM dataset is:
> Yao, L., Zhang, Y., Wei, B., Zhang, W., & Jin, Z. (2018). A topic modeling approach for traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions. *IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering*, 30(6), 1007-1021.

Now, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation in a structured manner.

By following this methodical approach, I ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for proper academic referencing and further research.
