To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Minimally-Supervised Speech Synthesis with Conditional Diffusion Model and Language Model: A Comparative Study of Semantic Coding" by Chunyu Qiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, experiments, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing TTS methods and may reference datasets used in their experiments. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets mentioned in relation to their comparative analysis.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant details.

In the **results section**, the authors may provide additional context about the datasets, such as performance metrics or comparisons across different models. This information can help confirm the datasets used and their significance in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. This is crucial for providing proper attribution to the datasets used in the research. I will ensure that I capture the complete citation format, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

From my reading, I expect to find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **AISHELL-3 Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as part of the test sets used for the minimally-supervised TTS methods. I will look for its full citation in the references.

2. **Tacotron-VAE, VALL-E, NaturalSpeech2, and SPEAR-TTS**: These models are referenced in the context of their datasets. I will check if the authors provide specific datasets associated with these models.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.

Finally, I will format the dataset information according to the specified requirements, ready for further processing or review.
