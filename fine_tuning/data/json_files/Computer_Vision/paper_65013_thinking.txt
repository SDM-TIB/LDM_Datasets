To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Dimension-Embedding-Aware Modality Fusion Transformer for Psychiatric Disorder Classification" by Guoxin Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used both private and public datasets for their experiments, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors describe the datasets used. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Private BD Dataset**: This dataset was collected from the Psychiatric Hospital of Zhumadian between 2014 and 2018, consisting of 91 subjects (52 bipolar disorder patients and 39 healthy controls). Each subject has two modalities of MRI data: T1w anatomical MPRAGE and resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). The T1w images have a volume size of 256 × 256 × 188, while the rs-fMRI images have a volume size of 64 × 64 × 33 with 210 frames.

2. **OpenfMRI Dataset**: This is a publicly available dataset with accession number ds000030, which includes 221 subjects (122 healthy controls, 50 schizophrenia subjects, and 49 bipolar disorder patients). The dataset also contains T1w anatomical MPRAGE images and rs-fMRI data, similar to the private BD dataset.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The private BD dataset does not have a formal citation since it is a proprietary dataset, but I will note its details as described in the paper. For the OpenfMRI dataset, I will reference the dataset's official page.

The citation for the OpenfMRI dataset is:
> OpenfMRI. "OpenfMRI Dataset ds000030." Available at: https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000030/

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the OpenfMRI dataset and provide a clear description of the private BD dataset.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
