To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling Generalized Specialist Approach To Train Quality Resilient Snapshot Ensemble" by Ghalib Ahmed Tahir et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the study conducted experiments on "three real-world food and a Malaysian food database," which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges faced by CNNs with distorted images and mention the need for large distorted datasets. This suggests that they are likely using specific datasets for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a summary of the datasets used, specifically in **Table I**, which lists the datasets along with their attributes. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **FOOD101**: Contains 101 classes with a total of 101,330 instances, with a training/testing split of 75,750/25,250.
2. **UECFOOD100**: Comprises 100 classes with 14,361 instances, split into 12,864 for training and 1,497 for testing.
3. **UECFOOD256**: Includes 256 classes with 31,148 instances, with a training/testing split of 28,033/3,115.
4. **Malaysian Food Database**: Contains 775 classes with 37,198 instances, with a training/testing split of 33,724/3,474.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **FOOD101**, the citation is:
  > Bossard, Lukas, Guillaumin, Matthieu, & Van Gool, Luc. "Food-101 â€“ Mining Discriminative Components with Random Forests." In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

- For **UECFOOD100**, the citation is:
  > Matsuda, Y., & Yanai, K. "Multiple-food recognition considering co-occurrence employing manifold ranking." In Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR), 2012.

- For **UECFOOD256**, the citation is:
  > Automatic Expansion of a Food Image Dataset Leveraging Existing Categories with Domain Adaptation. In Proceedings of the ECCV Workshop on Transferring and Adapting Source Knowledge in Computer Vision (TASK-CV), 2014.

- For **Malaysian Food Database**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is mentioned as the largest database used in the study.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
