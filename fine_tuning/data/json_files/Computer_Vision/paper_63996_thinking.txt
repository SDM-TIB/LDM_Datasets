To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Ray Sampling for Radiance Fields Reconstruction" by Shilei Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors leverage the **DTU dataset** for pretraining their model, which indicates that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In section 4.1, the authors mention that they use the **DTU dataset** for training and also refer to the **ZJU-MoCap dataset** for evaluating dynamic scenes. This section provides essential details about the datasets, including their purpose and characteristics.

In section 4.1, the authors specify:
1. **DTU Dataset**: Used for rapid generalization across varied scenes. It is a well-known dataset in the field of multi-view stereo.
2. **ZJU-MoCap Dataset**: This dataset is used for dynamic scenes and includes synchronized and calibrated multi-view videos.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **DTU dataset**, the citation is:
  > Rasmus Ramsbøl Jensen, A. Dahl, George Vogiatzis, Engil Tola, and Henrik Aanæs. *Large scale multi-view stereopsis evaluation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 406–413, 2014.

- For the **ZJU-MoCap dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sida Peng, Yuanqing Zhang, Yinghao Xu, Qianqian Wang, Qing Shuai, Hujun Bao, and Xiaowei Zhou. *Neural body: Implicit neural representations with structured latent codes for novel view synthesis of dynamic humans*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 9050–9059, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate downstream processing and ensure that the datasets are correctly attributed in any future work.
