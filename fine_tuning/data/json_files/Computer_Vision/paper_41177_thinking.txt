To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Implicit Context-aware Learning and Discovery for Streaming Data Analytics" by Kin Gwn Lore and Kishore K. Reddy, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the problem and context, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of contextual cues in machine learning and mention that they will evaluate their proposed algorithm on multiple datasets. This indicates that datasets will be described later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Problem Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention three datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Stagger Dataset**: This dataset consists of nominal attributes such as size, color, and shape, with a hidden target concept that switches at fixed intervals. The authors describe the dataset's structure and the nature of the task.

2. **MNIST-Digits Dataset**: A well-known dataset for digit recognition, the authors explain how they adapted it for their experiments by resizing images to a common dimension. They also mention the context-switching sequence used during training.

3. **Naval Propulsion Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from the UCI Data Repository and is used for condition-based maintenance. The authors provide details about the features and the classification task associated with this dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Stagger Dataset**, the citation is:
  > G. Widmer and M. Kubat. "Effective learning in dynamic environments tracking." In European Conference on Machine Learning, Springer, 1993, pp. 227–243.

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. LeCun. "The MNIST database of handwritten digits." http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, 1998.

- For the **Naval Propulsion Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Coraddu, L. Oneto, A. Ghio, S. Savio, D. Anguita, and M. Figari. "Machine learning approaches for improving condition-based maintenance of naval propulsion plants." Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part M: Journal of Engineering for the Maritime Environment, vol. 230, no. 1, pp. 136–153, 2016.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
