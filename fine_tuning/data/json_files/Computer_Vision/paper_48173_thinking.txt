To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DiffSinger: Singing Voice Synthesis via Shallow Diffusion Mechanism" by Jinglin Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the evaluations were conducted on a "Chinese singing dataset," which indicates that there is at least one dataset involved. I will note this and look for more specific details in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4). Here, the authors describe their experimental setup and mention the dataset used for evaluation. They specifically state that they collected and annotated a dataset called **PopCS**, which contains 117 Chinese pop songs totaling approximately 5.89 hours of audio. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed model.

In the **experimental setup subsection**, the authors provide additional details about how the dataset was created, including the recording conditions and the processing steps taken to align the audio with the lyrics. This information is important for understanding the dataset's context and usage.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the PopCS dataset. However, since this dataset appears to be newly created and not previously published, it may not have a formal citation in the references. Instead, the authors provide a link to the dataset's repository on GitHub, which can serve as a reference.

The relevant information I have gathered is as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: PopCS
   - **Description**: A Chinese Mandarin pop songs dataset containing 117 songs (approximately 5.89 hours of audio) recorded by a qualified female vocalist. The dataset includes lyrics and is processed for phoneme-level alignment.
   - **Citation**: The dataset is available at: https://github.com/MoonInTheRiver/DiffSinger.

Since PopCS is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

After completing these steps, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details about the dataset, including its name, description, and citation, ready for any further processing or review.
