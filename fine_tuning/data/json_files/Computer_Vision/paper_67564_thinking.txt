To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross Domain Generative Augmentation: Domain Generalization with Latent Diffusion Models" by Sobhan Hemati et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on multiple datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention using the following datasets:

1. **PACS Dataset**: This dataset is referenced multiple times throughout the paper, particularly in the context of evaluating the proposed method. It is a well-known dataset for domain generalization tasks.

2. **OfficeHome Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned as part of the evaluation process, indicating its relevance to the experiments conducted.

3. **DomainNet Dataset**: This dataset is included in the experiments and is significant for understanding the performance of the proposed method across different domains.

4. **VLCS Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as part of the evaluation framework, further confirming its use in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Here are the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
