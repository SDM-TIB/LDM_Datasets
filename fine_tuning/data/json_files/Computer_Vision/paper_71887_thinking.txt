To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ChatGPT and general-purpose AI count fruits in pictures surprisingly well" by Konlavach Mengsuwan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of ChatGPT and T-Rex on counting coffee cherries in images, which suggests that there is a dataset involved, specifically the images used for this counting task.

Next, I will look into the **Materials and Methods** section, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors mention that the images were collected from local partners during the cherry growing season and that they selected a subset of **100 images** representing various scenarios in coffee crops. This indicates that the dataset consists of these 100 images.

I will also check the **Results** section to confirm the dataset's relevance and usage in the experiments. The authors state that they tested the performance of different models on these 100 images, which reinforces the importance of this dataset in their analysis.

Now, I need to gather the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference a previous study by Palacio et al. (2024) for the larger dataset from which the 100 images were drawn. I will look up this citation in the **References section** to ensure I have the complete information.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Palacio, J. C. R., Bunn, C., Rahn, E., Little-Savage, D., Schimidt, P., & Ryo, M. (2024). Geographic-Scale Coffee Cherry Counting with Smartphones and Deep Learning. *Plant Phenomics*, 6, 0165. https://doi.org/10.34133/plantphenomics.0165

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Coffee Cherry Dataset**: A dataset consisting of 100 images of coffee tree branches with cherries, collected from local farmers in Colombia. The images were taken with smartphones and represent various conditions and scenarios in coffee cultivation.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
