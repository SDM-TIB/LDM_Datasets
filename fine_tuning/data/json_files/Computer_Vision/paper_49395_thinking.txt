To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Distinction between ASR Errors and Speech Disfluencies with Feature Space Interpolation" by Seongmin Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments with "5 different speech corpora," which suggests that specific datasets are used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.2 (Description of datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they list five datasets:

1. **SCOTUS**: This dataset consists of seven oral arguments between justices and advocates, with nested disfluency tags that were flattened and hand-annotated.

2. **CallHome**: A collection of telephone calls where participants were asked to call someone of their choice. Similar to SCOTUS, it has hand-annotated disfluency tags.

3. **AMI Meeting Corpus**: This dataset contains recordings of multiple-speaker meetings on various subjects, with annotations for speech disfluencies, body gestures, and named entities.

4. **ICSI Meeting Corpus**: A collection of multi-person meeting recordings, noted for having the highest count of disfluency-annotated transcripts among the datasets used.

5. **KsponSpeech**: A collection of spontaneous Korean speech recordings, each labeled with disfluencies and mispronunciations.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
