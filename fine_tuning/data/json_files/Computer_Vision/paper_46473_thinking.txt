To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "MRDet: A Multi-Head Network for Accurate Rotated Object Detection in Aerial Images" by Ran Qin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that they evaluate their method on two challenging benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In this section, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **DOTA (Dataset for Object Detection in Aerial Images)**: This dataset is described as containing 2,806 aerial images collected from various sources, with a total of 188,282 instances across 15 categories. The authors provide details about the image sizes and the nature of the annotations.

2. **HRSC2016 (High-Resolution Ship Classification Dataset)**: This dataset consists of 1,061 images collected from six harbors, with annotations for ships in various formats. The authors specify the number of images for training, validation, and testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **DOTA**, the citation is:
  > G. Xia, X. Bai, J. Ding, Z. Zhu, S. J. Belongie, J. Luo, M. Datcu, M. Pelillo, and L. Zhang. *DOTA: A large-scale dataset for object detection in aerial images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3974–3983, 2018.

- For **HRSC2016**, the citation is:
  > Z. Liu, L. Yuan, L. Weng, and Y. Yang. *A high resolution optical satellite image dataset for ship recognition and some new baselines*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Pattern Recognition Applications and Methods, pages 324–331, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
