To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Introducing Competition to Boost the Transferability of Targeted Adversarial Examples through Clean Feature Mixup" by Junyoung Byun et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **ImageNet-Compatible** and **CIFAR-10** datasets, which suggests that these are the datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly mention that they utilized the **ImageNet-Compatible dataset**, which consists of 1,000 images sized 299x299, along with their true and target classes for targeted attacks. They also mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, from which they randomly sampled 1,000 images (100 images per class) for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **ImageNet-Compatible dataset**, the citation is:
  > "ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009.

- For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. "Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images." 2009.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring they are structured correctly and ready for further processing or review.
