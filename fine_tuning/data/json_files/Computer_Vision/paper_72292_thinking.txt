To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GCEPNet: Graph Convolution-Enhanced Expectation Propagation for Massive MIMO Detection" by Qincheng Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methodology sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges in massive MIMO detection and mention various machine learning methods. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point. I will continue to the methodology section to look for any experimental details.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (which may be labeled differently, such as "Results" or "Evaluation") to find any datasets used for training or testing the proposed method. This section typically contains information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using a specific dataset for their experiments. For example, they might refer to a dataset like the **MIMO dataset** or any other relevant dataset used in their experiments. I will note down the name of the dataset and any details provided about it, such as the number of samples, features, and any specific configurations used during the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. I will look for papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, if the authors used a dataset from a previous study, I will extract the citation from the references. If they created a new dataset, I will look for a citation that describes the dataset's creation and characteristics.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are clear and well-organized for any further processing or review.
