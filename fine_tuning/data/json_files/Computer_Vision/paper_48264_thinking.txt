To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention-based Neural Beamforming Layers for Multi-channel Speech Recognition" by Bhargav Pulugundla et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed model is trained and evaluated on an **in-house multi-channel dataset**, which indicates that there is a dataset involved, but it does not provide a specific name.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Data)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for training and evaluation. They mention that they trained and evaluated the models on **20,000 hours of machine transcribed noisy data** consisting of de-identified speech queries from their in-house dataset. However, the specific name of this dataset is not provided, which is crucial for citation purposes.

Since the dataset is described as an in-house dataset, I will note that it does not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. I will still document the details provided in the paper, including the nature of the data (i.e., machine transcribed noisy data) and the context (i.e., de-identified speech queries).

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to datasets that might have been used in the context of the research. However, the references primarily cite other works related to techniques and methodologies rather than specific datasets.

Given that the authors did not provide a formal citation for the in-house dataset, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

- **In-house Multi-channel Dataset**: Contains 20,000 hours of machine transcribed noisy data, consisting of de-identified speech queries. The dataset is used for training and evaluation but lacks a formal citation.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring to highlight the lack of a formal citation for the in-house dataset while providing as much detail as possible based on the paper's content.
