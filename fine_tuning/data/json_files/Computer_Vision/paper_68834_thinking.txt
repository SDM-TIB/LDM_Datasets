To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stability Plasticity Decoupled Fine-Tuning for Few-Shot End-to-End Object Detection" by Yuantao Yin and Ping Yin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors conduct extensive experiments to verify their method's effectiveness, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they state that they use the **MS COCO-2014 dataset** for their experiments. This dataset is crucial for evaluating the few-shot object detection performance of their proposed method.

I will also look for any additional details about the dataset in this section. The authors specify that they treat 60 categories from the COCO dataset as base classes and the remaining 20 classes as novel classes. They report detection accuracy metrics such as AP, AP50, and AP75 on a test set consisting of 5,000 images with various shot settings.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MS COCO dataset. The citation for the COCO dataset is as follows:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Ma, Sergio Guadarrama, and Piotr Dollár. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, I have extracted the following dataset information:
1. **Dataset Name**: MS COCO-2014
   - **Description**: A dataset used for object detection, containing images with annotated objects across various categories.
   - **Citation**: Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Ma, Sergio Guadarrama, and Piotr Dollár. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

Now, I will prepare to format this dataset information according to the required structure for downstream processing.
