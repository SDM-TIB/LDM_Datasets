To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Areas of Attention for Image Captioning" by Marco Pedersoli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to achieving state-of-the-art results on the **MSCOCO dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely central to their research.

Next, I will examine the **experimental evaluation section (Section 4)**, where the authors discuss their experimental setup and the datasets used. In **Section 4.1**, they mention using the **MSCOCO dataset**, which consists of around 80K training images and 40K development images, each with five descriptive captions. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's size and purpose.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **related work** or **experiments** sections. However, the primary focus appears to be on the **MSCOCO dataset**. The authors do not mention any other datasets explicitly used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **MSCOCO dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> T. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, L. Bourdev, R. Girshick, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Doll√°r, and C. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: common objects in context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

Since the **MSCOCO dataset** is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that the citation is included.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the **MSCOCO dataset** with all the relevant details, ready for downstream processing or review.
