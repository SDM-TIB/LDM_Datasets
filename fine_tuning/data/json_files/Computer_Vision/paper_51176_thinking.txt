To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FuseDream: Training-Free Text-to-Image Generation with Improved CLIP+GAN Space Optimization" by Xingchao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on the **MS COCO dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely important for their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail, particularly the **experiments** section. In this section, the authors compare their method against various baselines and mention the **MS COCO dataset** explicitly as the dataset used for evaluation. This confirms its significance in their research.

I will also check the **related works** and **implementation details** sections to see if there are any additional datasets referenced or used in their experiments. However, the primary focus appears to be on the **MS COCO dataset**.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the **MS COCO dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755. Springer, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset in a structured manner, ensuring to include the full citation for the **MS COCO dataset** as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
