To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SVSGAN: Singing Voice Separation via Generative Adversarial Network" by Zhe-Cheng Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three datasets, which is a strong indication that I need to look for their names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset & Settings)**, where the authors provide specific information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **MIR-1K Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,000 song clips lasting between 4 to 13 seconds, recorded from 110 Chinese popular karaoke songs performed by both male and female amateurs. The authors note that the dataset includes manual annotations of pitch contours.

2. **iKala Dataset**: This dataset contains 352 30-second song clips recorded from Chinese popular songs performed by professional singers. The authors specify that only 252 clips are released as a public subset for evaluation, and it also includes manual annotations.

3. **DSD100 (Demixing Secret Database)**: This dataset is part of the Signal Separation Evaluation Campaign (SiSEC) and includes 50 songs in both Dev and Test parts, with each song providing four sources: bass, drums, other, and vocals. The average duration of the songs is about 4 minutes and 10 seconds.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **MIR-1K Dataset**, the citation is:
  > C.-L. Hsu and J.-S. R. Jang, “On the improvement of singing voice separation for monaural recordings using the MIR-1K dataset,” *IEEE Trans. Audio, Speech, Language Process.*, vol. 18, no. 2, pp. 310–319, Feb 2010.

- For the **iKala Dataset**, the citation is:
  > T.-S. Chan, T.-C. Yeh, Z.-C. Fan, H.-W. Chen, L. Su, Y.-H. Yang, and R. Jang, “Vocal activity informed singing voice separation with the iKala dataset,” in *Proc. IEEE Int. Conf. Acoust., Speech and Signal Process. (ICASSP)*, 2015, pp. 718–722.

- For the **DSD100**, the citation is:
  > “SiSEC MUS Homepage,” [Online] https://sisec.inria.fr/sisec-2016/2016-professionally-produced-music-recordings/, 2016.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
