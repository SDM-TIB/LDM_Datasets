To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Webly Supervised Image Classification with Self-Contained Confidence" by Jingkang Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results on two large-scale WSL datasets: **WebVision-1000** and **Food-101N**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets and Configurations)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find the following information:

1. **WebVision-1000**: This dataset contains 2.4 million noisy-labeled training images crawled from Flickr and Google, with keywords from 1000 class labels in ILSVRC-2012. The estimated web label accuracy is around 48%. 

2. **Food-101N**: This dataset consists of 310,000 images classified into 101 food categories, with images crawled from sources like Google and Yelp. The estimated label accuracy is around 80%, and it includes 60,000 human verification labels indicating the correctness of web labels.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **WebVision-1000**, the citation is:
  > Li, W., Wang, L., Li, W., Agustsson, E., Van Gool, L. (2017). *Webvision database: Visual learning and understanding from web data*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.02862.

- For **Food-101N**, the citation is:
  > Bossard, L., Guillaumin, M., Van Gool, L. (2014). *Food-101–mining discriminative components with random forests*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pp. 446–461.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
