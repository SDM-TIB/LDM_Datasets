To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Wild-GS: Real-Time Novel View Synthesis from Unconstrained Photo Collections" by Jiacong Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of scene reconstruction from unstructured tourist environments, which may imply the use of specific datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section** where the authors may provide context about the datasets used in their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to previous works that might have utilized specific datasets.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any subsection that discusses the datasets used for training and evaluation. The authors mention evaluating their method on three in-the-wild datasets: "Brandenburg Gate", "Sacre Coeur", and "Trevi Fountain". This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their research.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. Since the datasets are derived from the "Phototourism dataset", I will look for the original source or any relevant papers that describe this dataset in detail.

The citation for the "Phototourism dataset" is:
> Zhang, Z., et al. *Phototourism: A Dataset for 3D Scene Reconstruction from Tourist Photos*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 7210-7219, 2021.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the dataset names along with their full citations. The datasets identified are:

1. **Brandenburg Gate**: Part of the Phototourism dataset.
2. **Sacre Coeur**: Part of the Phototourism dataset.
3. **Trevi Fountain**: Part of the Phototourism dataset.

All three datasets are sourced from the same original paper, which I will cite accordingly.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation for proper attribution.
