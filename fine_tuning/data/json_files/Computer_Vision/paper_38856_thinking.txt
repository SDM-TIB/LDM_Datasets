To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Learning Framework for Assessing Physical Rehabilitation Exercises" by Yalin Liao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the framework is validated using a dataset of ten rehabilitation exercises, which suggests that a specific dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors provide details about the dataset used for validation. In this section, they mention the **University of Idaho – Physical Rehabilitation Movement Dataset (UI-PRMD)**, which consists of skeletal data collected from 10 healthy subjects performing 10 rehabilitation exercises. This dataset is crucial for understanding the framework's effectiveness.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the UI-PRMD dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> A. Vakanski, H. Jun, D. Paul, and R. Baker. *A Data Set of Human Body Movements for Physical Rehabilitation Exercises*. Data, vol. 3, no. 1, p. 2, Jan. 2018.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors also reference the **KIMORE dataset**, which contains data for rehabilitation exercises performed by healthy subjects and patients. This dataset is used to validate the proposed model on a different set of exercises.

The citation for the KIMORE dataset is:
> M. Capecci et al. *The KIMORE dataset: KInematic assessment of MOvement and clinical scores for remote monitoring of physical REhabilitation*. IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **University of Idaho – Physical Rehabilitation Movement Dataset (UI-PRMD)**: This dataset consists of skeletal data from 10 healthy subjects performing 10 rehabilitation exercises.
   - Citation: A. Vakanski, H. Jun, D. Paul, and R. Baker. *A Data Set of Human Body Movements for Physical Rehabilitation Exercises*. Data, vol. 3, no. 1, p. 2, Jan. 2018.

2. **KIMORE Dataset**: This dataset includes data for five rehabilitation exercises performed by 44 healthy subjects and 34 patients.
   - Citation: M. Capecci et al. *The KIMORE dataset: KInematic assessment of MOvement and clinical scores for remote monitoring of physical REhabilitation*. IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering, 2019.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
