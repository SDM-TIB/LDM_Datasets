To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion Models for Constrained Domains" by Nic Fishman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experimental sections typically detail the datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the applications of their methods in various fields, which may hint at the datasets they utilized. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to prior works that may have introduced relevant datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section is crucial as it usually contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for subsections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Data Collection." Here, I will identify any datasets that are explicitly named and described.

From my reading, I note the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Robotic Arm Dataset**: The authors refer to a dataset introduced by Jaquier et al. (2021) that contains demonstrations of a robotic arm drawing different letters in the plane. This dataset is used to model the velocity manipulability ellipsoids.

2. **Cyclic Peptide Dataset**: The authors generate a dataset of conformational ensembles for the cyclic peptide c-AAGAGG, which consists of 10^7 uniform samples satisfying specific anchor point distance constraints.

After identifying the datasets, I will ensure to compile the full citations accurately, as they are essential for proper referencing and validation of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring clarity and completeness in the documentation of each dataset extracted from the paper.
