To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Part to Whole: Collaborative Prompting for Surgical Instrument Segmentation" by Wenxi Yue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on the **EndoVis2018** and **EndoVis2017** datasets, indicating that these are the primary datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors provide a clear description of both datasets:

1. **EndoVis2018**: This dataset consists of 11 training videos and 4 validation videos, with each video containing 149 frames. It offers annotations for five instrument parts and includes seven instrument categories.

2. **EndoVis2017**: This dataset contains eight videos, each with 255 frames, and provides annotations for four instrument parts, also including seven instrument categories. The authors mention that they performed 4-fold cross-validation on this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **EndoVis2018**, the citation is:
  > Max Allan, Satoshi Kondo, Sebastian Bodenstedt, Stefan Leger, Rahim Kadkhodamohammadi, Imanol Luengo, Felix Fuentes, Evangello Flouty, Ahmed Mohammed, Marius Pedersen, et al. *2018 robotic scene segmentation challenge*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2001.11190, 2020.

- For **EndoVis2017**, the citation is:
  > Max Allan, Alex Shvets, Thomas Kurmann, Zichen Zhang, Rahul Duggal, Yun-Hsuan Su, Nicola Rieke, Iro Laina, Niveditha Kalavakonda, Sebastian Bodenstedt, et al. *2017 robotic instrument segmentation challenge*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.06426, 2019.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach allows me to accurately capture the necessary details for further processing or review.
