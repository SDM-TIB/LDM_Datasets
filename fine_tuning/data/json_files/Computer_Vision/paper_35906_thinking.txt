To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-Projective Dependency Parsing via Latent Heads Representation (LHR)" by Matteo Grella and Simone Cangialosi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of dependency parsing but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **experiments section** where datasets are likely to be mentioned.

In **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, the authors mention that they conducted performance evaluations on the **Penn Treebank (PTB)**, which is a well-known dataset for dependency parsing. They describe how they used this dataset for their experiments, indicating its relevance.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the Penn Treebank dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Marcus, M. P., Santorini, B., & Marcinkiewicz, M. A. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313â€“330.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Penn Treebank dataset.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Penn Treebank, ensuring that it is clear and complete for any future processing or review.
