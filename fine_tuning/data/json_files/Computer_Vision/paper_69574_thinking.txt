To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards the Detection of AI-Synthesized Human Face Images" by Yuhang Lu and Touradj Ebrahimi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that a benchmark was established, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Detection Benchmark for Synthetic Human Face Images)**, where the authors describe the dataset they collected. They mention that the dataset comprises real images from the **CelebA-HQ** dataset and synthetic human face images generated by seven generative models. This section is crucial as it provides specific details about the datasets used in their experiments.

The paper lists the generative models used to create synthetic images, which include:

1. **ProGAN**: Cited as Karras et al. (2018).
2. **StyleGAN2**: Cited as Karras et al. (2019).
3. **VQGAN**: Cited as Esser et al. (2021).
4. **DDPM**: Cited as Ho et al. (2020).
5. **DDIM**: Cited as Song et al. (2020).
6. **PNDM**: Cited as Liu et al. (2022).
7. **LDM**: Cited as Rombach et al. (2022).

In addition, the authors mention that the synthetic images were generated using these models, and they provide details about the dataset's structure, including the number of images generated and their resolution.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- **CelebA-HQ**: The citation is not explicitly provided in the text, but it is a well-known dataset in the field. The original paper is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for future reference or processing.
