To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compositional Scene Modeling with Global Object-Centric Representations" by Tonglin Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on four object-centric learning benchmarks, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will navigate to the **experiments section**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used. In this section, they mention four datasets: **Abstract**, **Animals**, **MNIST**, and **CLEVR-A**. I will take note of the context in which these datasets are used, including any specific characteristics or purposes mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **related works** and **methods** sections to gather additional context about each dataset, such as their origins or any modifications made for the experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will help in understanding the datasets' backgrounds. Here are the citations I will look for:

1. **Abstract Scene Dataset**: The authors reference the work by Zitnick and Parikh (2013) and others, which I will need to locate for the full citation.
2. **Animals Dataset**: This dataset is based on images from Yang et al. (2020), so I will find that citation as well.
3. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation for the MNIST dataset is commonly known, attributed to Deng (2012).
4. **CLEVR-A Dataset**: This dataset is an augmentation of the CLEVR dataset, which is cited from Johnson et al. (2017).

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset descriptions along with their full citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive understanding of each dataset's role in the research and proper attribution to the original sources.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring clarity and completeness for each dataset extracted from the paper.
