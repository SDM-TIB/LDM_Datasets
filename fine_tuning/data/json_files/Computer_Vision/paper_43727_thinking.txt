To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretable Multimodal Learning for Intelligent Regulation in Online Payment Systems" by Shuoyao Wang and Diwei Zhu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using real datasets from WeChat Pay, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention two specific datasets:

1. **31-D Dataset**: This dataset consists of transaction flow records from 50,000 merchants collected over a month (July 2019) for training, with 1,000 merchants each for validation and testing from August 2019. This dataset is crucial for evaluating the proposed method.

2. **7-D Dataset**: This dataset includes transaction flow records from 50,000 merchants collected over a week (July 1-7, 2019) for training, with similar validation and testing splits as the 31-D dataset. This dataset is also used for performance evaluation.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about how these datasets were constructed and the nature of the data included, confirming their relevance for the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are derived from WeChat Pay and not published in separate papers, I will note that the datasets are proprietary and do not have formal citations. Instead, I will reference the paper itself as the source of the datasets.

The citations for the datasets will be as follows:

- For the **31-D Dataset**, I will note:
  > Wang, S., & Zhu, D. (2023). Interpretable Multimodal Learning for Intelligent Regulation in Online Payment Systems. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Page Numbers]. 

- For the **7-D Dataset**, I will note:
  > Wang, S., & Zhu, D. (2023). Interpretable Multimodal Learning for Intelligent Regulation in Online Payment Systems. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Page Numbers]. 

Since both datasets are from the same paper, I will use the same citation for both.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that captures the essential details, ensuring that the citations are included appropriately for each dataset.
