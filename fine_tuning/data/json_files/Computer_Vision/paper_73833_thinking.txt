To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Segment Anything on the Fly: Auxiliary Online Learning and Adaptive Fusion for Medical Image Segmentation" by Tianyu Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on **eight datasets covering four medical imaging modalities**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) to find explicit mentions of the datasets used. In section 4.1, the authors state that they utilized datasets for polyp segmentation, gland segmentation, breast cancer segmentation, and fluid region segmentation. This is a good indication that specific datasets will be listed.

I will then look for a **table or a dedicated section** that lists these datasets. In the paper, I find that the authors mention several datasets in the context of their experiments:

1. **ClinicDB**: Used for polyp segmentation in endoscopic images.
2. **ColonDB**: Another dataset for polyp segmentation.
3. **ETIS**: Also used for polyp segmentation.
4. **Kvasir**: A dataset for polyp segmentation.
5. **CVC-300**: Used for polyp segmentation.
6. **BUSI**: A dataset for breast cancer segmentation in ultrasound images.
7. **GlaS**: A dataset for gland segmentation in histology images.
8. **Fluidchallenge**: A dataset for fluid region segmentation in OCT scans.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. I will look for any papers or sources that provide the datasets mentioned in the experiments. 

Here are the full citations for the datasets as found in the references:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
