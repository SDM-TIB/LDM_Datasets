To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Multi-view CNN-based Acoustic Classification System for Automatic Animal Species Identification" by Weitao Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their framework on **two real datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They refer to two datasets:

1. **Frog Dataset**: This dataset contains audio signals recorded from fourteen different species of frogs, with a sampling frequency of 24 kHz. The authors mention that more details can be found in reference [15].

2. **Cricket Dataset**: This dataset consists of audio signals recorded from twenty species of crickets, with a sampling frequency of 24 kHz. The authors also indicate that more details can be found in reference [1].

To confirm the details and obtain the full citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **Frog Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. Hao, B. Campana, E. Keogh. *Monitoring and mining animal sounds in visual space*. Journal of Insect Behavior, 26(4), 466–493, 2013.

- For the **Cricket Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Luque, D. F. Larios, E. Personal, J. Barbancho, C. León. *Evaluation of MPEG-7-based audio descriptors for animal voice recognition over wireless acoustic sensor networks*. Sensors, 16(5), 717, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
