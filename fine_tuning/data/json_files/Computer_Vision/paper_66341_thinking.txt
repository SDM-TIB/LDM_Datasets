To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FastBlend: a Powerful Model-Free Toolkit Making Video Stylization Easier" by Zhongjie Duan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that "extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of FastBlend," which suggests that datasets are likely involved in these experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors describe their evaluation methods. In **Section 4.4 (Human Evaluation)**, they mention using the **Pixabay100 dataset**, which contains 100 videos collected from Pixabay along with manually written prompts. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Pixabay100 dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Pixabay. *Pixabay100: A dataset of 100 videos collected from Pixabay*. Available at: https://pixabay.com/videos/.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about it.

Now, I will summarize the findings for the dataset in a structured manner, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

After completing this process, I will have a clear entry for the dataset used in the research paper, ready for any further processing or documentation.
