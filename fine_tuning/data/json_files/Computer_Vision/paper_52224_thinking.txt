To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Multi-Modal Representations for Ambiguity Detection & Coreference Resolution in the SIMMC 2.0 Challenge" by Javier Chiyah-Garcia et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and the datasets section** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the SIMMC 2.0 Challenge, which suggests that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (The SIMMC 2.0 Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. They describe the SIMMC 2.0 dataset as a collection of task-oriented dialogues in a multi-modal setting, specifically in the domains of fashion and furniture. The dataset consists of **11,244 dialogues** collected through self-play and human paraphrase annotation, with specific splits for training and evaluation.

I will note the details provided about the dataset, including its purpose, structure, and the number of dialogues, as these are essential for a comprehensive description.

After identifying the dataset, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SIMMC 2.0 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **SIMMC 2.0 Dataset**:
  > Kottur, S.; Moon, S.; Geramifard, A.; and Damavandi, B. (2021). *SIMMC 2.0: A Task-oriented Dialog Dataset for Immersive Multimodal Conversations*. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 4903â€“4912. Online and Punta Cana, Dominican Republic: Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have the dataset details and the citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset's characteristics and provides the necessary citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is ready for review or further processing, maintaining clarity and accuracy in the representation of the dataset information.
