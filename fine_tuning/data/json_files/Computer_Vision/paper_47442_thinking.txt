To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Learning Approach for Active Anomaly Detection of Extragalactic Transients" by V. Ashley Villar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors used **1% of the PLAsTiCC dataset** to train their autoencoder. This indicates that the PLAsTiCC dataset is a key dataset in this research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or datasets mentioned. The introduction discusses the challenges of identifying transients and mentions various surveys but does not introduce new datasets.

Moving on to **section 2 (Dataset and Preprocessing)**, I will find detailed information about the PLAsTiCC dataset. The authors describe it as a simulation of three years of Rubin Observatory data, containing over **3.5 million transient events** from eighteen unique physical classes. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset, including its structure and purpose.

In this section, the authors also reference the original papers that describe the PLAsTiCC dataset. I will need to extract these citations for a complete reference.

The relevant citations for the PLAsTiCC dataset are:
- **PLAsTiCC Dataset**: 
  > Allam Jr, T., Bahmanyar, A., Biswas, R., et al. (2018). *Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.00001.
  
  > Kessler, R., Narayan, G., Avelino, A., et al. (2019). *The Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2008.04912.

Next, I will check the **results** and **discussion** sections to see if any other datasets are mentioned or referenced. However, the focus remains on the PLAsTiCC dataset, and no new datasets are introduced.

Finally, I will compile the information I have gathered about the PLAsTiCC dataset, including its description and full citations, ensuring that I format it correctly for clarity and completeness.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the PLAsTiCC dataset, and I will ensure to include its full citation as follows:
- Allam Jr, T., Bahmanyar, A., Biswas, R., et al. (2018). *Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.00001.
- Kessler, R., Narayan, G., Avelino, A., et al. (2019). *The Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2008.04912.

With this structured approach, I can confidently extract and document the datasets from the research paper.
