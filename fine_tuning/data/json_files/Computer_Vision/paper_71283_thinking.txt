To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DiffusionFace: Towards a Comprehensive Dataset for Diffusion-Based Face Forgery Analysis" by Zhongxi Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of the **DiffusionFace dataset**, which is a key dataset for the study. The introduction further elaborates on the limitations of existing datasets and emphasizes the need for a comprehensive dataset tailored for diffusion-based facial forgery detection.

Next, I will look into the **Datasets** section, which is likely where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their research. In this section, I will identify the specific datasets mentioned, their characteristics, and any relevant statistics or features.

From the text, I can identify the following datasets:

1. **DiffusionFace Dataset**: This is the primary dataset introduced in the paper. It includes various forgery categories and is designed to help develop advanced detection models for identifying forgery facial images created by diffusion methods. The dataset comprises 600,000 images, including 30,000 genuine facial images sourced from the **Multi-Modal-CelebA-HQ** dataset.

2. **Multi-Modal-CelebA-HQ Dataset**: This dataset serves as the source data for generating the DiffusionFace dataset. It contains 30,000 high-resolution facial images, each accompanied by semantic masks, attribute labels, and descriptive text.

Additionally, the paper references several existing datasets that are compared to the DiffusionFace dataset. These include:

- **DE-FAKE**: A dataset for detecting fake images generated by text-to-image diffusion models.
- **CIFAKE**: A dataset for image classification and identification of AI-generated synthetic images.
- **DMD-LSUN**: A dataset that combines diffusion models with GANs to create a significant corpus of images.
- **Celeb-DF**: A large-scale dataset for deepfake forensics.
- **FaceForensics++**: A widely used dataset for deepfake detection.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The citations are typically found in the **References** section of the paper. Here are the citations I will include:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets referenced in the paper and provide the necessary citations for each.
