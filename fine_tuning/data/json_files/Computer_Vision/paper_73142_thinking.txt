To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PaGoDA: Progressive Growing of a One-Step Generator from a Low-Resolution Diffusion Teacher" by Dongjun Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **ImageNet**, which is a well-known dataset for image classification and generation tasks. This is a strong indication that this dataset is used in their work.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail. In section 5.1, the authors describe their experiments on **ImageNet**, specifying that they collected latent representations for all ImageNet data using a specific method. This confirms that **ImageNet** is indeed one of the datasets utilized in their experiments.

Additionally, in section 5.3, the authors mention using the **CC12M dataset** for text-to-image generation, which is another dataset relevant to their work. They also refer to a filtered version of the **COYO-700M dataset**, which they used for training their model. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **ImageNet**:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *Imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge*. International journal of computer vision, 115:211â€“252, 2015.

2. **CC12M**:
   > Soravit Changpinyo, Piyush Sharma, Nan Ding, and Radu Soricut. *Conceptual 12M: Pushing web-scale image-text pre-training to recognize long-tail visual concepts*. In CVPR, 2021.

3. **COYO-700M**:
   > Minwoo Byeon, Beomhee Park, Haecheon Kim, Sungjun Lee, Woonhyuk Baek, and Saehoon Kim. *Coyo-700m: Image-text pair dataset*. https://github.com/kakaobrain/coyo-dataset, 2022.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper attribution and reference in any further work or analysis.
