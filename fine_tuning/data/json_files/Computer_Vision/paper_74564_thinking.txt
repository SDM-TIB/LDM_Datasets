To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GridSweep Simulation: Measuring Subsynchronous Impedance Spectra of Distribution Feeders" by Lingling Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the GridSweep instrument and its capabilities, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the research. The introduction discusses the GridSweep instrument and its historical context but does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then focus on the **experiments and results sections**. In these sections, the authors describe various testbeds and simulations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources used for simulations or comparisons. 

In the **comparison sections**, the authors discuss the results of simulations and measurements, but they do not explicitly name datasets. However, they reference previous works and methodologies that may imply the use of certain datasets.

Next, I will check the **references section** for any cited works that may correspond to datasets. The references include various papers that might have datasets associated with them. I will look for any papers that are known to provide datasets relevant to the GridSweep simulations.

After reviewing the entire paper, I will compile the information I have gathered. If I find any datasets mentioned, I will ensure to include their full citations. If no specific datasets are identified, I will note that the paper primarily discusses simulations and methodologies rather than specific datasets.

Finally, I will summarize my findings, ensuring that I include full citations for any datasets I identify, formatted according to academic standards. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets related to the research conducted in the paper.
