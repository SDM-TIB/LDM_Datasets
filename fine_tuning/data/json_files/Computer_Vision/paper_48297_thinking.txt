To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Independent Asymmetric Embedding for Information Diffusion Prediction on Social Networks" by Wenjin Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Twitter Dataset**: This dataset is derived from Twitter and consists of 137,093 nodes, 3,589,811 edges, and 569 cascades. The authors note that users sharing the same message are treated as a cascade ordered by sharing time.

2. **Digg Dataset**: This dataset is collected from the Digg platform and contains 279,632 nodes, 2,617,993 edges, and 3,553 cascades with timestamps.

3. **Douban Dataset**: This dataset is extracted from Douban, a popular social network in China, comprising 13,777 nodes, 567,250 edges, and 21,756 cascades.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For the datasets mentioned, I will look for the original sources or papers that describe these datasets. Based on the context provided in the paper, I can derive the following citations:

- For the **Twitter Dataset**, the citation is:
  > N. O. Hodas and K. Lerman. "The simple rules of social contagion." *Scientific Reports*, vol. 4, p. 4343, 2014.

- For the **Digg Dataset**, the citation is:
  > T. Hogg and K. Lerman. "Social dynamics of digg." *EPJ Data Science*, vol. 1, no. 1, p. 5, 2012.

- For the **Douban Dataset**, since the paper does not provide a specific citation, I will note that it is derived from the "Top100 users" network, which may not have a formal citation but is widely recognized in the context of social network studies.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
