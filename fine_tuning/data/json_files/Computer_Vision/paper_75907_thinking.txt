To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SEDS: Semantically Enhanced Dual-Stream Encoder for Sign Language Retrieval" by Longtao Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various datasets, which indicates that specific datasets are likely discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the datasets are mentioned in **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation.

The datasets identified in this section are:

1. **How2Sign**: A large-scale continuous American Sign Language (ASL) dataset, which includes 31,019 training pairs, 1,738 validation pairs, and 2,348 testing pairs.
2. **CSL-Daily**: A Chinese Sign Language (CSL) dataset focusing on daily life scenarios, containing 18,401 training pairs, 1,077 validation pairs, and 1,176 testing pairs.
3. **PHOENIX-2014T**: A German Sign Language (DGS) dataset that includes weather forecast content, with 7,096 training pairs, 519 validation pairs, and 642 testing pairs.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **How2Sign**, the citation is:
  > Amanda Duarte, Shruti Palaskar, Lucas Ventura, Deepti Ghadiyaram, Kenneth DeHaan, Florian Metze, Jordi Torres, and Xavier Giro-i Nieto. *How2Sign: a large-scale multimodal dataset for continuous American Sign Language*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2735–2744, 2021.

- For **CSL-Daily**, the citation is:
  > Hao Zhou, Wengang Zhou, Weizhen Qi, Junfu Pu, and Houqiang Li. *Improving sign language translation with monolingual data by sign back-translation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1316–1325, 2021.

- For **PHOENIX-2014T**, the citation is:
  > Necati Cihan Camgoz, Simon Hadfield, Oscar Koller, Hermann Ney, and Richard Bowden. *Neural sign language translation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 7784–7793, 2018.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented.
