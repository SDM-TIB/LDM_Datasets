To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Interpretable Parallel Recurrent Neural Networks with Convolutional Attentions for Multi-Modality Activity Modeling" by Kaixuan Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their model on two benchmarked datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors discuss the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **PAMAP2 Dataset**: This dataset includes data from 9 participants performing 12 daily living activities, collected using Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) at various body locations. 

2. **MHEALTH Dataset**: This dataset is designed for benchmarking human activity recognition methods and includes data from three IMUs placed on participants' bodies while they perform 12 activities.

3. **MARS Dataset**: This is a real-world dataset collected by the authors, involving 8 participants performing 5 basic activities, also using IMUs.

I will then look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **PAMAP2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Reiss and D. Stricker. "Introducing a new benchmarked dataset for activity monitoring." In *Wearable Computers (ISWC), 2012 16th International Symposium on*, pp. 108â€“109, 2012.

- For the **MHEALTH Dataset**, the citation is:
  > O. Banos et al. "Design, implementation and validation of a novel open framework for agile development of mobile health applications." *Biomedical engineering online*, vol. 14, no. 2, p. S6, 2015.

- For the **MARS Dataset**, since it is a dataset collected by the authors themselves, I will note that it does not have a formal citation in the references but can be described as follows:
  > MARS (Multimodal Activity Recognition with Sensing) dataset, collected by the authors, involves 8 participants performing 5 basic activities.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for PAMAP2 and MHEALTH, and a description for MARS, ready for structured output.
