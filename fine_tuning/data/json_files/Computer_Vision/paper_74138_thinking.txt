To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Unmet Promise of Synthetic Training Images: Using Retrieved Real Images Performs Better" by Scott Geng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the comparison between synthetic data generated by Stable Diffusion and real images retrieved from the LAION-2B dataset, indicating that both datasets are relevant.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the authors elaborate on their methodology. They mention using the **LAION-2B dataset** for generating synthetic images and retrieving real images. This section confirms the importance of the LAION-2B dataset in their experiments.

I will then look into the **experiments** section, particularly **section 4**, where the authors describe their main experiments. They mention five visual recognition tasks for which they curated datasets:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset for image classification.
2. **Describable Textures Dataset (DTD)**: A dataset for texture recognition.
3. **FGVC-Aircraft**: A dataset for fine-grained visual classification of aircraft.
4. **Stanford Cars**: A dataset for fine-grained classification of cars.
5. **Oxford Flowers102**: A dataset for flower classification.

In this section, the authors detail how they curated datasets for these tasks, confirming their relevance for the experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
