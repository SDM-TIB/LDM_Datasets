To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prompt Decoupling for Text-to-Image Person Re-identification" by Weihao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the method on "three widely used datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **CUHK-PEDES**: This dataset is described as having 1000 training images and 3058 validation images, with an average of two descriptions per image.

2. **ICFG-PEDES**: This dataset contains 1000 training images and 3074 validation images, with a single textual description per image.

3. **RSTPReid**: This dataset includes 2000 training images and 1000 validation images, with varying numbers of descriptions.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **CUHK-PEDES**, the citation is:
  > Li, S., Xiao, T., Li, H., Zhou, B., Yue, D., Wang, X. (2017). *Person search with natural language description*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 1970–1979.

- For **ICFG-PEDES**, the citation is:
  > Ding, Z., Ding, C., Shao, Z., Tao, D. (2021). *Semantically self-aligned network for text-to-image part-aware person re-identification*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2107.12666.

- For **RSTPReid**, the citation is:
  > Zhu, A., Wang, Z., Li, Y., Wan, X., Jin, J., Wang, T., Hu, F., Hua, G. (2021). *DSSL: Deep surroundings-person separation learning for text-based person retrieval*. In Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on Multimedia (ACMMM), pp. 209–217.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
