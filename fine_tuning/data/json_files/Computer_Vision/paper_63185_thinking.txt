To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sat2Cap: Mapping Fine-Grained Textual Descriptions from Satellite Images" by Aayush Dhakal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their model on a "new large-scale dataset with 6.1M pairs of overhead and ground-level images," which suggests that a specific dataset is being introduced.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Method)**, particularly **subsection 3.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they created. Here, they mention that their dataset is derived from the **YFCC100M dataset**, which contains 99.3 million images collected from Flickr. They specify that their cross-view dataset excludes all US imagery and filters out non-geotagged images, resulting in a dataset of 6.1 million images, each with geolocation and timestamp metadata.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the YFCC100M dataset, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citation for the YFCC100M dataset is as follows:
> Bart Thomee, David A Shamma, Gerald Friedland, Benjamin Elizalde, Karl Ni, Douglas Poland, Damian Borth, and Li-Jia Li. *YFCC100M: The new data in multimedia research*. Communications of the ACM, 59(2):64â€“73, 2016.

Additionally, I will note that the authors mention using the **Bing Maps API** to download overhead images, but this is not a dataset in itself; rather, it is a tool used to obtain images for their dataset.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Cross-View Dataset**: A new dataset created by the authors, consisting of 6.1 million pairs of overhead and ground-level images, derived from the YFCC100M dataset.

2. **YFCC100M Dataset**: The original dataset from which the authors derived their cross-view dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
