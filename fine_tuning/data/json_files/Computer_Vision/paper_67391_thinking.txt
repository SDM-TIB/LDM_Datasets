To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Stable Diffusion for Data Augmentation in COCO and Weed Datasets" by Boyang Deng, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the study utilizes "seven common categories and three widespread weed species," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Method)**, specifically **subsection 2.1 (Dataset)**, where the author explicitly lists the datasets used in the study. Here, I find two datasets:

1. **COCO Dataset**: The paper describes it as a large dataset with about 2.5 million labeled instances across 328,000 images, covering 91 distinguishable categories. The author mentions that they utilized seven specific categories for their experiments.

2. **CottonWeedDet12 Dataset**: This dataset comprises 5,648 images of 12 weed species, with a focus on three species: Purslane, Ragweed, and Palmer Amaranth. The author provides details about the number of images for each species, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's composition.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **COCO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lin, Tsung-Yi, Maire, Michael, Belongie, Serge, Hays, James, Perona, Pietro, Ramanan, Deva, Dollár, Piotr, & Zitnick, C Lawrence. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. Paper presented at the Computer Vision–ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V 13.

- For the **CottonWeedDet12 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dang, Fengying, Chen, Dong, Lu, Yuzhen, & Li, Zhaojian. (2023). *YOLOWeeds: a novel benchmark of YOLO object detectors for multi-class weed detection in cotton production systems*. Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 205, 107655.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the study along with their proper citations.
