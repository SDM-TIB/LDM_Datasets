To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Multi-Adversarial Variational Autoencoder Networks" by Abdullah-Al-Zubaer Imran and Demetri Terzopoulos, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to using datasets from the computer vision and medical imaging domains, specifically naming **Street View House Numbers**, **CIFAR-10**, and **Chest X-Ray datasets**. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 5)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they specify:

1. **Street View House Numbers (SVHN) Dataset**: This dataset contains 73,257 digit images for training and 26,032 digit images for testing, with images labeled as one of the ten digits (0-9).

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32 × 32 pixel color images across 10 classes, with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

3. **Chest X-Ray (CXR) Dataset**: This dataset is used for classifying pneumonia and normal images, containing 5,216 training and 624 test images.

The authors also provide specific details about the structure and purpose of each dataset, confirming their relevance to the experiments conducted.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **SVHN Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Netzer, Y., Wang, T., Coates, A., Bissacco, A., Wu, B., and Ng, A. Y. (2011). *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. In NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning, number 2 in 2011, p. 5.

- For the **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., and Hinton, G. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer.

- For the **Chest X-Ray Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kermany, D. S., Goldbaum, M., Cai, W., Valentim, C. C., Liang, H., Baxter, S. L., McKeown, A., Yang, G., Wu, X., Yan, F., et al. (2018). *Identifying medical diagnoses and treatable diseases by image-based deep learning*. Cell, 172(5), 1122–1131.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach ensures that I capture all relevant details accurately and comprehensively.
