To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Generalized Implementation of Wasserstein Distance in GANs" by Minkai Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments in section 5, where they mention testing their model on **CIFAR-10** and **Tiny-ImageNet** datasets. This is a clear indication that these datasets are relevant to their research.

I will then gather detailed descriptions of these datasets from the text. The paper states that both datasets consist of tens of thousands of real-world color images with class labels. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

For **Tiny-ImageNet**, the citation is:
> Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In CVPR. IEEE, 2009.

Now that I have the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are ready for review or further processing, maintaining clarity and accuracy in the documentation of the datasets used in the research.
