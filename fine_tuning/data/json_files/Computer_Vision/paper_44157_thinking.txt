To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Video Coding using Multiscale Motion Compensation and Spatiotemporal Context Model" by Haojie Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **Introduction section**. Here, the authors discuss the motivation behind their research and the context of video coding. However, they do not specify any datasets in this section either.

I will then examine the **Experimental Studies section**, specifically subsection A, which discusses datasets and hyperparameters for model training. The authors mention the following datasets:

1. **COCO Dataset**: Used for training the neuro-Intra model. The authors state that training samples are randomly cropped into 256×256×3 dimensions.
   
2. **CLIC Dataset**: Also used for training the neuro-Intra model, with similar cropping dimensions as COCO.

3. **Vimeo 90k Dataset**: This dataset is used for joint training of the neuro-Motion, MS-MCN, and neuro-Res models, with sample sizes of 192×192×3.

4. **HEVC Test Sequences**: These sequences are used for evaluating the NVC framework, covering various classes with different motion, frame rates, and resolutions.

5. **Ultra Video Group (UVG) Dataset**: This dataset consists of seven 1080p videos and is also used for evaluating the NVC framework.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets mentioned are as follows:

- **COCO Dataset**:

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
