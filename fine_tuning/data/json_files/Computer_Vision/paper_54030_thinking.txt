To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Texture Extraction Methods Based Ensembling Framework for Improved Classification" by Vijay Pandey et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of texture-based classification and mention that they present state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets. This indicates that specific datasets will be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, they mention using six benchmark datasets: **KTH**, **FMD**, **DTD**, **MINC**, **GTOS**, and **GTOS-M**. I will note down these datasets and look for any specific details provided about them.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any additional context or performance metrics related to these datasets. This section often contains valuable information about how the datasets were utilized and the outcomes of the experiments.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for any papers or sources that describe these datasets in detail.

Here are the datasets I have identified along with their citations:

1. **KTH Dataset**:
   > Barbara Caputo, Eric Hayman, and P Mallikarjuna. *Class-specific material categorisation*. In Tenth IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV’05) Volume 1, volume 2, page 1597—1604. IEEE, 2005.

2. **FMD Dataset**:
   > Lavanya Sharan, Ruth Rosenholtz, and Edward Adelson. *Material perception: What can you see in a brief glance?* Journal of Vision, 9(8):784—784, 2009.

3. **DTD Dataset**:
   > Mircea Cimpoi, Subhransu Maji, Iasonas Kokkinos, Sammy Mohamed, and Andrea Vedaldi. *Describing textures in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, page 3606—3613, 2014.

4. **MINC Dataset**:
   > Sean Bell, Paul Upchurch, Noah Snavely, and Kavita Bala. *Material recognition in the wild with the materials in context database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 3479–3487, 2015.

5. **GTOS Dataset**:
   > Jia Xue, Hang Zhang, and Kristin Dana. *Deep texture manifold for ground terrain recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 558–567, 2018.

6. **GTOS-M Dataset**:
   > Wei Zhai, Yang Cao, Zheng-Jun Zha, HaiYong Xie, and Feng Wu. *Deep structure-revealed network for texture recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 11010–11019, 2020.

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
