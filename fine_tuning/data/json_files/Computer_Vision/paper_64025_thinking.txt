To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deformation Robust Text Spotting with Geometric Prior" by Xixuan Hao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the **Chinese Artistic Dataset (ARText)**, which contains 33,000 artistic images, indicating that this is a primary dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Chinese Artistic Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the ARText dataset. They mention that it consists of 33,000 images collected from the internet, with character-level and text-level annotations, and that it is divided into a training set of 30,000 images and a testing set of 3,000 images. This section confirms the dataset's purpose and structure.

Additionally, I will check **section 5.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors mention the **IC19-ReCTS dataset** as another dataset used for experiments. They provide a brief description, stating that it contains 25,000 labeled images, with 20,000 for training and 5,000 for testing.

Now, I will gather the full citations for both datasets from the **References section**:

1. For the **Chinese Artistic Dataset (ARText)**, since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:
   > Xixuan Hao, Aozhong Zhang, Xianze Meng, and Bin Fu. *Deformation Robust Text Spotting with Geometric Prior*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023.

2. For the **IC19-ReCTS dataset**, the citation is:
   > Rui Zhang, Yongsheng Zhou, Qianyi Jiang, Qi Song, Nan Li, Kai Zhou, Lei Wang, Dong Wang, Minghui Liao, Mingkun Yang, et al. *ICDAR 2019 Robust Reading Challenge on Reading Chinese Text on Signboard*. In Proceedings of the 2019 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), pages 1577â€“1581, 2019.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
