To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Direction-Dependent Turning Leads to Anisotropic Diffusion and Persistence" by Nadia Loy, Thomas Hillen, and Kevin J. Painter, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for mentions of specific datasets or experiments that involve data collection.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to prior studies or datasets that the authors may have used as a foundation for their work. This section often contains citations that can lead to the identification of relevant datasets.

I will then focus on the **methods section**, where the authors typically describe the experimental setup and the data collection process. Here, I will look for any specific datasets used in their experiments, including any numerical simulations or data from previous studies.

In the **results section**, I will check for any figures, tables, or descriptions that mention datasets or data sources. The authors may present data that was collected or analyzed, and I will ensure to note these datasets.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Based on my reading, I will compile the following datasets:

1. **Doyle et al. dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of cell movement on micro-patterned surfaces. The full citation is:
   > Doyle, A. D., Wang, F. W., Matsumoto, K., & Yamada, K. M. (2009). One-dimensional topography underlies three-dimensional fibrillar cell migration. *Journal of Cell Biology*, 184(4), 481-490.

2. **Experimental data on cell migration**: The authors mention using experimental data from various studies to support their findings. I will need to identify specific studies cited in the paper that provide this data.

3. **Simulated datasets**: The paper discusses simulations of cell movement based on their model. I will note that these datasets are generated from the authors' computational models, but they may not have a formal citation since they are original to this study.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that each dataset is documented with its full citation, as this is essential for proper academic practice and for readers who may wish to explore the datasets further.
