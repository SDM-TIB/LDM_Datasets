To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Latent Optimal Paths by Gumbel Propagation for Variational Bayesian Dynamic Programming" by Xinlei Niu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the application of their method in **two real-world applications: text-to-speech and singing voice synthesis**, which suggests that datasets related to these applications may be included.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6), where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for validation. In **Section 6.2**, they specifically mention using the **RyanSpeech dataset** for the text-to-speech task. I will extract the details about this dataset, including its size and characteristics.

In **Section 6.4**, the authors refer to the **TIMIT dataset** for the dynamic time warping (DTW) experiment. I will gather information about this dataset as well, noting its significance in speech recognition tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **RyanSpeech Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Zandie, R., Mahoor, M. H., Madsen, J., & Emamian, E. S. (2021). *Ryanspeech: A corpus for conversational text-to-speech synthesis*. In Proceedings of the Interspeech Conference. doi: 10.21437/Interspeech.2021-341. URL: https://doi.org/10.21437/Interspeech.2021-341.

2. **TIMIT Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Garofolo, J., Lamel, L., Fisher, W., Fiscus, J., Pallett, D., Dahlgren, N., & Zue, V. (1992). *TIMIT acoustic-phonetic continuous speech corpus*. Linguistic Data Consortium.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured output that is ready for review or further processing.
