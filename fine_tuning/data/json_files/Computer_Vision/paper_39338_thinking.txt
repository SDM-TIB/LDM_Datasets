To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Video Classification with Channel-Separated Convolutional Networks" by Du Tran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors reference their experiments on **Sports1M, Kinetics, and Something-Something**, indicating that these are the datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the paper, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their models on the following datasets:

1. **Sports1M**: A large-scale action recognition dataset containing 1.1 million videos from 487 sport action classes.
2. **Kinetics-400**: A benchmark dataset for action recognition in videos, containing about 260K videos of 400 different human action categories.
3. **Something-Something-v1**: A dataset consisting of 100K videos of 174 different object-interaction actions.

I will then verify the details of these datasets in the **experiments** section to confirm their usage and any specific configurations mentioned.

After confirming the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Sports1M**, the citation is:
  > Andrej Karpathy, George Toderici, Sanketh Shetty, Thomas Leung, Rahul Sukthankar, and Li Fei-Fei. *Large-scale video classification with convolutional neural networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2014.

- For **Kinetics-400**, the citation is:
  > Will Kay, Joao Carreira, Karen Simonyan, Brian Zhang, Chloe Hillier, Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan, Fabio Viola, Tim Green, Trevor Back, Paul Natsev, Mustafa Suleyman, and Andrew Zisserman. *The kinetics human action video dataset*. CoRR, abs/1705.06950, 2017.

- For **Something-Something-v1**, the citation is:
  > Raghav Goyal, Samira Ebrahimi Kahou, Vincent Michalski, Joanna Materzynska, Susanne Westphal, Heuna Kim, Valentin Haenel, Ingo Fründ, Peter Yianilos, Moritz Mueller-Freitag, Florian Hoppe, Christian Thurau, Ingo Bax, and Roland Memisevic. *The “something something” video database for learning and evaluating visual common sense*. arXiv:1706.04261, 2017.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
