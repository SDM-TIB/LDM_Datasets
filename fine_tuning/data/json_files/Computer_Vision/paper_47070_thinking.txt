To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PCB-Fire: Automated Classification and Fault Detection in PCB" by Tejas Khare et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the problem and solution, but I need to look for specific dataset details in the main body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Proposed Method section**, where the authors describe their approach. Here, they mention that the object detection model was trained using a **DSLR dataset of 530 PCB images**. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used, and I will need to gather more details about it.

In the **Dataset Generation subsection**, the authors specify that they used **510 PCB images for training** and **20 images for testing**. They also mention that the dataset was split into training and validation samples, which is important for understanding how the dataset was utilized.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DSLR dataset. The paper provides a link to the dataset, which is crucial for proper citation. The citation for the DSLR dataset is:

> PCB DSLR Dataset. Available: https://cvl.tuwien.ac.at/research/cvl-databases/pcb-dslr-dataset/

Since this is an open-source dataset, I will ensure to note that in the dataset description.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
