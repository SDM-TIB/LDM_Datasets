To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GFPack++: Improving 2D Irregular Packing by Learning Gradient Field with Attention" by Tianyang Xue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions that the authors validated their algorithm using six datasets, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Implementation)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for validation. Here, they mention the following datasets:

1. **Garment Dataset**: This dataset is derived from real manufacturing scenarios and is used to evaluate the packing algorithm.

2. **Dental Dataset**: Another dataset from real manufacturing scenarios, specifically generated by packing dental data according to alphabetical boundaries.

3. **Puzzle (square) Dataset**: This dataset consists of randomly generated polygon shapes and irregular boundaries, designed to assess the method's generalizability.

4. **Puzzle (arbitrary) Dataset**: Similar to the Puzzle (square) dataset, but includes a variety of polygon shapes and boundaries.

5. **Atlas (building) Dataset**: This dataset contains UV patches of 3D models and is used in conjunction with the other datasets.

6. **Atlas (object) Dataset**: Another dataset from the Atlas collection, also containing UV patches of 3D models.

In the same section, the authors mention that they utilized **SVGnest** as the teacher algorithm to generate exemplar packing results for the Garment and Dental datasets, and they provide additional details about the generation process.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are primarily described in the context of the paper and do not have separate publications, I will focus on citing the paper itself for the datasets derived from it.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Tianyang Xue, Mingdong Wu, Lin Lu, Haoxuan Wang, Hao Dong, and Baoquan Chen. *GFPack++: Improving 2D Irregular Packing by Learning Gradient Field with Attention*. In SIGGRAPH Asia 2023 Conference Papers, Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, Article 105, 11 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3610548.3618235

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for each dataset as described in the paper. Each dataset will be documented with its name, description, and the citation of the paper as the source.
