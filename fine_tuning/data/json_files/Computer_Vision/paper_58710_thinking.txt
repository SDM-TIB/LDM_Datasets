To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fairly Adaptive Negative Sampling for Recommendations" by Xiao Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that "Extensive experiments on four public datasets show our proposed methodâ€™s superiority in group fairness enhancement and fairness-utility tradeoff." This indicates that multiple datasets are used, prompting me to look for their names and details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in **section 4 (Experiment)**, where they state that they conducted experiments on four public datasets. They specifically mention:

1. **MovieLens 1M (ML1M)**: This dataset consists of movie ratings across different genres, treated as positive feedback.
2. **Amazon product reviews**: This dataset includes historical product reviews from the Amazon platform, also treated as positive feedback.
3. **ML1M-2**: A subset of the MovieLens dataset focusing on two genres, 'Sci-Fi' and 'Horror'.
4. **Amazon-2**: A subset of the Amazon dataset focusing on two product types, 'Grocery' and 'Tool'.
5. **ML1M-4**: A version of the MovieLens dataset with four genres: 'Sci-Fi', 'Adventure', 'Children', and 'Horror'.
6. **Amazon-4**: A version of the Amazon dataset with four product types: 'Grocery', 'Office', 'Pet', and 'Tool'.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were split into training, validation, and test sets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MovieLens 1M**:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The Movielens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS), 2015.

- For **Amazon product reviews**:
  > Julian McAuley and J. Leskovec. *Image-based Recommendations on Styles and Substitutes*. In Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, 2015.

- For **ML1M-2** and **Amazon-2**, since they are subsets of the original datasets, I will cite the original datasets as their references.

- For **ML1M-4** and **Amazon-4**, the same logic applies; I will reference the original datasets.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or citations.
