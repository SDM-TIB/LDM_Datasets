To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Alarm System for Segmentation Algorithm Based on Shape Model" by Fengze Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset and Segmentation Algorithm)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three public medical datasets:

1. **NIH Pancreas-CT Dataset**: This dataset consists of 82 abdominal 3D CT scans from 53 male and 27 female subjects, selected by radiologists from patients without major abdominal pathologies or pancreatic cancer lesions.

2. **Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD)**: This dataset includes 420 abdominal 3D CT scans (281 for training and 139 for testing) from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, with many subjects having cancer lesions within the pancreas region.

3. **Synapse Dataset**: This dataset comprises 50 abdomen CT scans (30 for training and 20 for testing) randomly selected from a combination of an ongoing colorectal cancer chemotherapy trial and a retrospective ventral hernia study.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **NIH Pancreas-CT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Holger R Roth, Le Lu, Amal Farag, Hoo-Chang Shin, Jiamin Liu, Evrim B Turkbey, and Ronald M Summers. *Deeporgan: Multi-level deep convolutional networks for automated pancreas segmentation*. In MICCAI, pages 556â€“564. Springer, 2015.

- For the **Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD)**, the citation is:
  > Medical Segmentation Decathlon. *http://medicaldecathlon.com/index.html*.

- For the **Synapse Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Synapse. *https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn3193805/wiki/217789*.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this data into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the information is clear and accessible for future reference or analysis.
