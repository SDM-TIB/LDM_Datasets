To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Competition analysis on the over-the-counter credit default swap market" by Louis Abraham, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses data collected as part of the EMIR regulation, which suggests that there is a specific dataset related to this regulation.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (EMIR Data)**, where the author describes the data collection process and the types of reports included in the dataset. Here, I will look for specific names and details about the datasets used in the analysis.

In **subsection 2.1 (Data description)**, the author mentions that the EMIR dataset contains transaction data from the over-the-counter (OTC) derivative market, specifically focusing on credit default swaps (CDS). This is a key dataset for the research.

The author also describes the types of reports that make up the EMIR dataset:
1. **Trade Activity Reports**: These contain detailed information about every contract modification.
2. **Trade State Reports**: These provide daily aggregated versions of the trade activity reports.
3. **Collateral Valuation Reports**: These contain information about collateral for each portfolio.

In **subsection 2.2 (Data cleaning and augmentation)**, the author discusses the cleaning process for the CDS data, which further confirms the focus on this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. Since the EMIR dataset is based on regulatory data, it may not have a traditional citation like other datasets. However, I will note that the dataset is derived from the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) and is accessed through the Bank of France.

The citation for the EMIR dataset can be summarized as follows:
> European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) dataset, accessed through the Bank of France.

Finally, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the EMIR dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the EMIR dataset, which is central to the analysis of competition in the OTC CDS market.
