To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DR2: Diffusion-based Robust Degradation Remover for Blind Face Restoration" by Zhixin Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various datasets, indicating that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Implementation)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and testing their model. Here, they mention several datasets:

1. **CelebA-Test**: This dataset is derived from CelebA-HQ and is used for testing the performance of the proposed method under various degradation conditions. The authors describe how they synthesize degraded images from high-quality images using a specific degradation model.

2. **WIDER-Face**: The authors mention selecting 400 critical cases from this dataset to form the WIDER-Critical dataset and another 400 regular cases for the WIDER-Normal dataset.

3. **CelebChild**: This dataset consists of 180 child faces of celebrities collected from the Internet, which are noted to be mildly degraded.

4. **LFW-Test**: This dataset contains low-quality images with mild degradation, specifically selected from the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **CelebA-HQ**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3730–3738, 2015.

- For **WIDER-Face**, the citation is:
  > Shuo Yang, Ping Luo, Chen-Change Loy, and Xiaoou Tang. *Wider Face: A Face Detection Benchmark*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 5525–5533, 2016.

- For **LFW**, the citation is:
  > Gary B. Huang, Marwan Mattar, Tamara Berg, and Eric Learned-Miller. *Labeled Faces in the Wild: A Database for Studying Face Recognition in Unconstrained Environments*. In Workshop on Faces in ‘Real-Life’ Images: Detection, Alignment, and Recognition, 2008.

The **CelebChild** dataset does not have a specific citation provided in the references, as it is a collection of images sourced from the Internet.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or citations related to the datasets used in the research.
