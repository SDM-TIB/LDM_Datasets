To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Context-Gated Convolution" by Xudong Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details about their characteristics or usage.

In **subsection 4.1 (Implementation Details)**, the authors mention six benchmark datasets used for their experiments: **ImageNet**, **CIFAR-10**, **ObjectNet**, **Something-Something (v1)**, **Kinetics**, and **IWSLT’14 De-En**. I will take note of these datasets and their specific roles in the experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used.

1. **ImageNet**: The citation is:
   > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3), 211–252, 2015.

2. **CIFAR-10**: The citation is:
   > Krizhevsky, A., et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Tech. Rep., Citeseer, 2009.

3. **ObjectNet**: The citation is:
   > Barbu, A., Mayo, D., Alverio, J., Luo, W., Wang, C., Gutfreund, D., Tenenbaum, J., Katz, B. *ObjectNet: A Large-Scale Bias-Controlled Dataset for Pushing the Limits of Object Recognition Models*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 9448–9458, 2019.

4. **Something-Something (v1)**: The citation is:
   > Goyal, R., Ebrahimi Kahou, S., Michalski, V., Materzynska, J., Westphal, S., Kim, H., Haenel, V., Fruend, I., Yianilos, P., Mueller-Freitag, M., Hoppe, F., Thurau, C., Bax, I., Memisevic, R. *The “Something Something” Video Database for Learning and Evaluating Visual Common Sense*. In The IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2017.

5. **Kinetics**: The citation is:
   > Carreira, J., Zisserman, A. *Quo Vadis, Action Recognition? A New Model and the Kinetics Dataset*. In CVPR, 2017.

6. **IWSLT’14 De-En**: The citation is:
   > Cettolo, M., Niehues, J., Stüker, S., Bentivogli, L., Federico, M. *Report on the 11th IWSLT Evaluation Campaign, IWSLT 2014*.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
