To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AutoCLIP: Auto-tuning Zero-Shot Classifiers for Vision-Language Models" by Jan Hendrik Metzen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that AutoCLIP is evaluated across a broad range of datasets, which indicates that multiple datasets are likely discussed in the paper. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is typically where datasets used for evaluation are detailed. The authors explicitly list the datasets they used for their experiments, which include:

1. **CUB200**: This dataset is referenced as a benchmark for fine-grained image classification, specifically for bird species.
2. **EuroSAT**: This dataset is mentioned for land use and land cover classification tasks.
3. **Food101**: This dataset is used for food classification tasks.
4. **Oxford Pets**: This dataset is utilized for classifying images of cats and dogs.
5. **ImageNet**: A well-known dataset for large-scale image classification.
6. **ImageNetV2**: A variant of the original ImageNet dataset.
7. **ImageNet-R**: A dataset that includes images with various corruptions and transformations.
8. **ImageNet-C**: A dataset that focuses on robustness against common corruptions.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
