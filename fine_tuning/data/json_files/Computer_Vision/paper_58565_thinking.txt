To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Q-Diffusion: Quantizing Diffusion Models" by Xiuyu Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed method to various tasks, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their use in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset is commonly used for image classification tasks and consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The authors mention using it for evaluating their method in the context of unconditional image generation.

2. **LSUN Bedrooms**: This dataset contains images of bedrooms and is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method in generating high-resolution images. The authors specify that they use 256x256 images from this dataset.

3. **LSUN Churches**: Similar to the Bedrooms dataset, this dataset contains images of churches and is also used for high-resolution image generation evaluations.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **LSUN Bedrooms**, the citation is:
  > Fisher Yu, Ari Seff, Yinda Zhang, Shuran Song, Thomas Funkhouser, and Jianxiong Xiao. *LSUN: Construction of a Large-Scale Image Dataset Using Deep Learning with Humans in the Loop*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.03365, 2015.

- For **LSUN Churches**, the citation is the same as for the Bedrooms dataset, as they are part of the same LSUN dataset collection.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented for future reference or analysis.
