To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodal Multi-Head Convolutional Attention with Various Kernel Sizes for Medical Image Super-Resolution" by Mariana-Iuliana Georgescu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three datasets, which suggests that I should look for specific names and details in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Data Sets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **IXI Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 3D multimodal MRI scans with three modalities (T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and Proton Density). The dataset is split into 500 training scans, 6 validation scans, and 70 testing scans, with each scan comprising 96 slices of 240 × 240 pixels.

2. **NAMIC Brain Multimodality Dataset**: This dataset consists of 20 3D MRI scans, each with two modalities (T1-weighted and T2-weighted). The authors mention that the dataset is split into 10 training and 10 testing scans, with 2 scans used for validation.

3. **Coltea-Lung-CT-100W Dataset**: This dataset includes 100 triphasic lung CT scans, each with three modalities (native, arterial, and venous). The dataset is divided into 70 training scans, 15 validation scans, and 15 testing scans, with a total of 12,430 slices of 512 × 512 pixels.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **IXI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > "IXI Dataset." *Brain Development*. Available at: http://brain-development.org/ixi-dataset/

- For the **NAMIC Brain Multimodality Dataset**, the citation is:
  > "NAMIC Brain Multimodality Dataset." *National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NAMIC)*. Available at: https://www.na-mic.org/wiki/Downloads

- For the **Coltea-Lung-CT-100W Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ristea, N.-C., Miron, A.-I., Savencu, O., Georgescu, M.-I., Verga, N., Khan, F. S., & Ionescu, R. T. (2021). *CyTran: Cycle-Consistent Transformers for Non-Contrast to Contrast CT Translation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.06400.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
