To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Slot Machines: Discovering Winning Combinations of Random Weights in Neural Networks" by Maxwell Mbabilla Aladago and Lorenzo Torresani, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of their method on **CIFAR-10** and **MNIST**, indicating that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about their experimental setup. In **subsection 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, they mention using **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10** for their experiments. They describe the architectures used for these datasets, specifically mentioning the **Lenet-300-100** architecture for MNIST and various convolutional architectures for CIFAR-10.

In **subsection 4.2**, they compare the performance of their method against traditionally-trained networks on both datasets, confirming that both **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10** are indeed the datasets utilized for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, University of Toronto, 2009. [http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
