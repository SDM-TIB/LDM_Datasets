To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uniform Ck-Approximations for Symmetric & Antisymmetric Functions" by Soumya Ganguly, Khoa Tran, and Rahul Sarkar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract typically provides a concise overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets, such as **"Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology."** These sections usually contain explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the research.

As I read through these sections, I will take note of any datasets mentioned. For instance, if the authors refer to a dataset used for training or testing their models, I will record the name of the dataset and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, types of data included, and any specific characteristics that are highlighted.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets easily. I will look for papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail, ensuring that I capture the correct citation format.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will find the corresponding citation, which might look like:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted datasets are clearly documented, with attention to detail regarding their usage in the research, to facilitate further analysis or replication of the study.
