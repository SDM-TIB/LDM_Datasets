To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Idea-2-3D: Collaborative LMM Agents Enable 3D Model Generation from Interleaved Multimodal Inputs" by Junhao Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides an overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the introduction and experiments sections, where datasets are more likely to be discussed.

In the **introduction**, the authors describe the novel framework and its capabilities, but they do not mention specific datasets. I will then look for sections that might detail the experimental setup or datasets used.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**. Here, the authors discuss their experimental setup and evaluation protocols. They mention using various models and configurations, but I need to look for any specific datasets that were utilized in their experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors refer to a set of user-generated IDEAs for evaluation, but they do not provide specific dataset names or citations. Instead, they mention that the evaluation set consists of 20 diverse user-generated IDEAs, which include examples of multimodal inputs.

Since there are no explicit datasets mentioned in the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the models or methods discussed. However, the references primarily focus on related works and models rather than specific datasets.

Given that the paper does not provide specific datasets or their citations, I will conclude that there are no formal datasets to extract from this paper. Instead, I will summarize the findings regarding the evaluation set of user-generated IDEAs, noting that these are not formal datasets with citations.

In summary, I will document that the paper does not explicitly mention or provide citations for any datasets, focusing instead on the user-generated IDEAs used for evaluation. If any datasets were referenced indirectly through the models, I would note those references, but in this case, it appears there are none.

Thus, I will prepare a summary of my findings without any dataset entries, as there are no formal datasets to cite from this research paper.
