To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Effective Two-stage Training Paradigm Detector for Small Dataset" by Zheng Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in the VIPriors Challenge 2023, which suggests that a specific dataset is used for their experiments. The introduction confirms that the dataset used in the object detection track is **DelftBikes**, which contains 10,000 bike pictures.

Next, I will look for a dedicated section that discusses datasets in detail. In this case, the **introduction** provides a brief overview of the **DelftBikes dataset**, stating that it is split into 8,000 training images and 2,000 testing images, with 22 densely annotated parts per image. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

To ensure I have all necessary details, I will also check the **experiments** section to see if there are any additional insights or confirmations regarding the dataset's use. The authors mention achieving a 30.4% average precision on the **DelftBikes test set**, which reinforces that this dataset is central to their work.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the **DelftBikes dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Osman Semih Kayhan, Bart Vredebregt, and Jan C Van Gemert. *Hallucination in object detection—a study in visual part verification*. In 2021 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP), pages 2234–2238. IEEE, 2021.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will summarize the dataset details and prepare to format them according to the specified requirements. The key dataset extracted from this paper is:

1. **DelftBikes Dataset**: Contains 10,000 bike pictures with 22 densely annotated parts per image, split into 8,000 training and 2,000 testing images.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
