        "dcterms:description": "The Head-Mounted Display (HMD) dataset has images captured from cameras mounted on a head-mounted display (HMD). There are 123 different identities in total. For each identity, a diverse set of expressions and sentences are recorded in frames and are labeled as 'neutral face', 'smile', 'frown', 'raise cheeks' and others. For each frame, we capture different views such as the mouth, left eyes, and right eyes. During preprocessing, we sample the images near the peak frame of each expression, resulting in around 1,500 images for each identity. The images are gray-scale and are normalized and resized to 256x256 before given to the network as input. We also train a keypoint detector to extract the keypoints near the mouth, nose and the eyes.",
