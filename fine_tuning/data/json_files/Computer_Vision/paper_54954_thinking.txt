To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convolutional Fine-Grained Classification with Self-Supervised Target Relation Regularization" by Kangjun Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the method is evaluated on "a number of diverse benchmarks of multiple visual classification tasks," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they explicitly mention the datasets they used:

1. **CUB-200-2011 Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a widely used benchmark for fine-grained image classification. The authors state that it contains 200 classes of birds, with a total of 5,994 training images.

2. **Stanford Cars Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as another benchmark, consisting of 196 classes of cars with 8,144 training images.

3. **FGVC Aircraft Dataset**: The authors refer to this dataset, which contains 100 classes of aircraft with 6,667 training images.

4. **iNaturalist 2018 Dataset**: This dataset is noted for its large scale, containing 8142 classes with 437,513 training images.

5. **CIFAR Dataset**: The authors also mention using CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, which are standard datasets for image classification tasks.

6. **DTD (Describable Textures Dataset)**: This dataset is referenced for texture classification tasks, containing 47 classes.

7. **MIT Scene Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned for scene classification, containing 67 classes.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CUB-200-2011 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*.

- For **Stanford Cars Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Krause, J., Stark, M., Deng, J., & Fei-Fei, L. (2013). *3D Object Representations for Fine-Grained Categorization*.

- For **FGVC Aircraft Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Maji, S., Rahtu, E., Kannala, J., Blaschko, M., & Vedaldi, A. (2013). *Fine-Grained Visual Classification of Aircraft*.

- For **iNaturalist 2018 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Van Horn, G., Mac Aodha, O., Song, Y., Cui, Y., Sun, C., Shepard, A., Adam, H., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2018). *The iNaturalist Species Classification and Detection Dataset*.

- For **CIFAR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*.

- For **DTD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cimpoi, M., Maji, S., Kokkinos, I., Mohamed, S., & Vedaldi, A. (2014). *Describing Textures in the Wild*.

- For **MIT Scene Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Quattoni, A., & Torralba, A. (2009). *Recognizing Indoor Scenes*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
