To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LION: Latent Point Diffusion Models for 3D Shape Generation" by Xiaohui Zeng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that LION achieves state-of-the-art generation performance on multiple ShapeNet benchmarks, indicating that ShapeNet is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** section, particularly in subsections that detail the experimental setup. In the experiments, the authors explicitly state that they use the **ShapeNet** dataset for evaluating their model. They mention training on three categories: airplane, chair, and car, which provides insight into the specific subsets of the dataset they utilized.

I will also check the **background** and **related work** sections to see if any additional datasets are referenced. However, the primary focus remains on ShapeNet, which is a widely recognized dataset in the field of 3D shape generation.

In the **results** section, the authors provide performance metrics for their model on the ShapeNet dataset, reinforcing its significance in their experiments. They also mention using the **TurboSquid** dataset for training on animal shapes, which is another dataset that needs to be documented.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The citations are as follows:

1. **ShapeNet Dataset**:
   > Angel X. Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, Leonidas Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qixing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Hao Su, Jianxiong Xiao, Li Yi, and Fisher Yu. *ShapeNet: An Information-Rich 3D Model Repository*. Technical Report arXiv:1512.03012 [cs.GR], Stanford University — Princeton University — Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, 2015.

2. **TurboSquid Dataset**:
   > TurboSquid. *TurboSquid Data Repository*. Available at: https://www.turbosquid.com. Custom license obtained for use.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that the full citations are included for each dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
