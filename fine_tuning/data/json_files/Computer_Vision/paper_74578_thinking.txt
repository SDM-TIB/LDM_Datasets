To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CollaFuse: Collaborative Diffusion Models" by Simeon Allmendinger et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on the **CelebA dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely significant for their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly state that they trained and evaluated their collaborative diffusion models on the **CelebA dataset**. They provide details about the dataset, including its size and the attributes associated with the images.

In this section, the authors describe the **CelebA dataset** as follows:
- It consists of over **200,000 facial images** of celebrities, each annotated with **40 binary attribute labels** such as gender, age, hair color, and facial expressions. The dataset is noted for its diversity, featuring celebrities from various ethnicities and backgrounds.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CelebA dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 373â€“378, 2015.

Since the paper primarily discusses the CelebA dataset, I will focus on this dataset for extraction.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will allow for easy reference and use in future research or applications.
