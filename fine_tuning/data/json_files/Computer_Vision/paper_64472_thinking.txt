To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Delving into Multimodal Prompting for Fine-grained Visual Classification" by Xin Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting extensive experiments on four FGVC datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their evaluations:

1. **CUB-200-2011**: This dataset comprises 11,788 bird images from 200 bird species, split into 5,994 training images and 5,794 test images.

2. **Stanford Dogs**: This dataset contains 20,580 images depicting 120 dog variants, with 12,000 images for training and 8,580 for testing.

3. **NABirds**: This dataset includes 48,562 images showcasing North American birds across 555 subcategories, divided into 23,929 training images and 24,633 test images.

4. **Food101**: This dataset encompasses 101 different kinds of foods, totaling 101,000 images, with 750 training images and 250 test images per class.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CUB-200-2011**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C.; Branson, S.; Welinder, P.; Perona, P.; and Belongie, S. J. 2011. *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*.

- For **Stanford Dogs**, the citation is:
  > Khosla, A.; Jayadevaprakash, N.; Yao, B.; and Fei-Fei, L. 2011. *Novel Dataset for Fine-Grained Image Categorization*. In CVPR Workshop, volume 2.

- For **NABirds**, the citation is:
  > Horn, G. V.; Branson, S.; Farrell, R.; Haber, S.; Barry, J.; Ipeirotis, P.; Perona, P.; and Belongie, S. J. 2015. *Building a Bird Recognition App and Large Scale Dataset with Citizen Scientists: The Fine Print in Fine-Grained Dataset Collection*. In CVPR, 595–604.

- For **Food101**, the citation is:
  > Bossard, L.; Guillaumin, M.; and Gool, L. V. 2014. *Food-101 - Mining Discriminative Components with Random Forests*. In ECCV, volume 8694, 446–461.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
