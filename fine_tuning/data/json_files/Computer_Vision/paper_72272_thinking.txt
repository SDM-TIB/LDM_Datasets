To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FlashSpeech: Efficient Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis" by Zhen Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the efficiency of the FlashSpeech system but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments** sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention advancements in zero-shot speech synthesis and refer to the use of large-scale datasets. However, they do not specify any dataset names here. I will proceed to the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training and evaluation.

In **section 4.1.1 (Data and Preprocessing)**, the authors explicitly state that they used the **Multilingual LibriSpeech (MLS)** dataset, which includes 44.5k hours of transcribed audiobook data and features 5490 distinct speakers. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, and I will note its details.

Next, I will look for the full citation of the **Multilingual LibriSpeech (MLS)** dataset in the **References section**. The citation is as follows:
> Vineel Pratap, Qiantong Xu, Anuroop Sriram, Gabriel Synnaeve, and Ronan Collobert. *MLS: A Large-Scale Multilingual Dataset for Speech Research*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2012.03411, 2020.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about the dataset, including its name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that the full citation is included for clarity and proper attribution. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
