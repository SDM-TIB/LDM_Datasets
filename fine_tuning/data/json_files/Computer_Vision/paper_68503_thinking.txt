To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SnapCap: Efficient Snapshot Compressive Video Captioning" by Jianqiao Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "two widely-used VC datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4). In **Section 4.1**, the authors explicitly state the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **MSRVTT Dataset**: This dataset consists of 10,000 video clips, each with 20 captions. The authors mention that it is divided into 6,513 training samples, 497 validation samples, and 2,990 testing samples.

2. **MSVD Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 1,200 training videos, 100 validation videos, and 670 testing videos.

Both datasets are widely recognized in the video captioning community, and their mention here confirms their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MSRVTT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jun Xu, Tao Mei, Ting Yao, and Yong Rui. *MSR-VTT: A Large Video Description Dataset for Bridging Video and Language*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 5288–5296, 2016.

- For the **MSVD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > David Chen and William B Dolan. *Collecting Highly Parallel Data for Paraphrase Evaluation*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 190–200, 2011.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be used for further processing or documentation.
