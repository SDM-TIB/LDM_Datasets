To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhanced sampling of Crystal Nucleation with Graph Representation Learnt Variables" by Ziyue Zou and Pratyush Tiwary, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors examined the nucleation of various allotropes and polymorphs of iron and glycine, indicating that datasets related to these materials are likely included.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly **section II.B (Dataset Preparation)**, where the authors describe how they prepared the datasets for their study. Here, they mention two primary systems: iron and glycine. 

1. **Iron Dataset**: The authors state that the training data for iron allotropes was generated by LAMMPS simulations, which included various configurations of iron particles (α-Fe, γ-Fe, ϵ-Fe, and molten Fe). They constructed supercells and performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, resulting in 2000 frames of MD snapshots.

2. **Glycine Dataset**: The authors describe obtaining crystal structures of glycine polymorphs from the Crystallography Open Database. They prepared different supercells for α-glycine, β-glycine, γ-glycine, and liquid glycine, conducting MD simulations to generate 2000 frames for training.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **Crystallography Open Database**, the citation is:
  > Gražulis, S., Chateigner, D., Downs, R. T., Yokochi, A. F. T., Quirós, M., Lutterotti, L., Manakova, E., Butkus, J., Moeck, P., & Le Bail, A. (2009). Crystallography Open Database – an open-access collection of crystal structures. *Journal of Applied Crystallography*, 42, 726–729.

- For the **LAMMPS simulations**, while there is no specific dataset citation, the software itself is referenced:
  > Thompson, A. P., Aktulga, H. M., Berger, R., Bolintineanu, D. S., Brown, W. M., Crozier, P. S., in ’t Veld, P. J., Kohlmeyer, A., Moore, S. G., Nguyen, T. D., Shan, R., Stevens, M. J., Tranchida, J., Trott, C., & Plimpton, S. J. (2022). LAMMPS - a flexible simulation tool for particle-based materials modeling at the atomic, meso, and continuum scales. *Comp. Phys. Comm.*, 271, 108171.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited according to the requirements.
