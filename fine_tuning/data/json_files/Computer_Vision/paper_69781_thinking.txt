To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Uncanny Valley: A Comprehensive Analysis of Diffusion Models" by Karam Ghanem and Danilo Bzdok, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference "recent studies" and "various datasets" but do not specify any names. I will continue to the methods section, where the authors describe their experimental setup.

In the **methods section**, particularly in subsection 3.2, the authors mention that they trained various diffusion models on multiple datasets, including **CIFAR10** and **FFHQ**. This is a crucial finding as it identifies specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **results section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors provide further details about the datasets used. The results section primarily discusses the performance of the models on the mentioned datasets but does not introduce any new datasets.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors do not provide specific citations for CIFAR10 and FFHQ within the text, so I will use known references for these datasets:

1. **CIFAR10**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2009.

2. **FFHQ**: The citation is:
   > Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. *A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 4401-4410, 2019.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. 

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- **CIFAR10** with citation: Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2009.
- **FFHQ** with citation: Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. *A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 4401-4410, 2019.

Now, I will prepare to present this information in the required format.
