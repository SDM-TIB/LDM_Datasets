To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion Models with Implicit Guidance for Medical Anomaly Detection" by Cosmin I. Bercea et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of THOR for detecting and segmenting anomalies in brain MRIs and wrist X-rays, suggesting that datasets related to these medical imaging tasks are likely included.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4**, where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In **section 4.1**, they mention two datasets for the brain MRI experiments:

1. **IXI Dataset**: This dataset includes 582 T1-weighted MRI scans used for training, along with 217 healthy samples from the ATLAS v2.0 dataset. The authors also mention that the ATLAS dataset is used for testing, which contains 655 T1w MRI scans with expertly segmented lesion masks.

2. **ATLAS v2.0 Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as providing healthy samples and is also used for testing with segmented lesion masks.

In **section 4.2**, the authors describe the dataset used for the pediatric wrist X-ray experiments:

3. **GRAZPEDWRI-DX Dataset**: This dataset consists of 10,643 X-rays of pediatric wrist injuries from 6,091 individual patients, annotated with bounding boxes for various anomalies.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **IXI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > IXI dataset. https://brain-development.org/ixi-dataset/, accessed: 2023-02-15.

- For the **ATLAS v2.0 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Liew, S.L., Lo, B.P., Miarnda R. Donnelly, et al. *A large, curated, open-source stroke neuroimaging dataset to improve lesion segmentation algorithms*. Scientific Data 9 (2022).

- For the **GRAZPEDWRI-DX Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nagy, E., Janisch, M., Hržić, F., et al. *A pediatric wrist trauma x-ray dataset (grazpedwri-dx) for machine learning*. Scientific Data 9, 222 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01328-z.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets utilized in the research.
