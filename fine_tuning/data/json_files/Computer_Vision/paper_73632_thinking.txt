To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Infinite 3D Landmarks: Improving Continuous 2D Facial Landmark Detection" by P. Chandran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention using a studio dataset consisting of dense facial skin landmarks and an in-the-wild synthetic dataset containing sparse landmark annotations. This indicates that there are at least two datasets to extract.

I will then gather detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any specific features that are relevant to the research. For instance, the studio dataset contains 37,344 images with 47,022 dense facial skin landmarks, while the synthetic dataset includes 100,000 in-the-wild images with 68 sparse facial landmarks.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

The citations I will look for include:
1. For the studio dataset, I will find the citation for the work by Chandran et al. (2020) that describes the dataset.
2. For the synthetic dataset, I will locate the citation for the work by Wood et al. (2021) that details the dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset descriptions along with their full citations to ensure that they are accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
