To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Autoencoded Image Compression for Secure and Fast Transmission" by Aryan Kashyap et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but the dataset details are likely to be found in the **Dataset section**.

In **section III (Dataset)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for training and evaluation:

1. **Stanford Dogs Dataset**: This dataset contains 20,580 color images of 120 different dog breeds. The authors note that these images were gathered from the ImageNet dataset. They also mention that while the dataset includes annotations such as class labels and bounding box coordinates, only the image data was utilized for their work.

2. **Animals 10 Dataset**: This dataset comprises 26,200 images across 10 categories (dog, cow, horse, elephant, butterfly, cat, chicken, sheep, spider, and squirrel), obtained from Google Images.

Additionally, for evaluation, the authors used the **Natural Images Dataset**, which consists of images from various classes, with eight images selected for testing.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Stanford Dogs Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Khosla, N. Jayadevaprakash, B. Yao, and F.-F. Li. *Novel dataset for fine-grained image categorization: Stanford dogs*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2011.

- For the **Animals 10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. Alessio. *Animals-10 dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10, 2020.

- For the **Natural Images Dataset**, the citation is:
  > P. Roy, Saumik Bhattacharya, and S. Ghosh. *Natural images dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naturalprasunroy/natural-images, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
