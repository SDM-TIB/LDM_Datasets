To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FaceHop: A Light-Weight Low-Resolution Face Gender Classification Method" by Mozhdeh Rouhsedaghat et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the effectiveness of the FaceHop method is demonstrated by experiments on two benchmarking datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In this section, they state that they adopt the **LFW dataset** and the **CMU Multi-PIE dataset** for their experiments. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for the evaluation of their proposed method.

I will then gather detailed descriptions of each dataset from the text:

1. **LFW Dataset**: The authors describe it as consisting of 13,233 face images of 5,749 individuals, collected from the web. They also mention that a 3D aligned version of LFW is used in their experiments.

2. **CMU Multi-PIE Dataset**: This dataset contains more than 750,000 images of 337 subjects recorded in four sessions. The authors specify that they select a subset of the 01 session, which includes frontal and slightly non-frontal face images with various expressions and illumination conditions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **LFW dataset**, the citation is:
  > G. B. Huang, M. Ramesh, T. Berg, and E. Learned-Miller. "Labeled faces in the wild: A database for studying face recognition in unconstrained environments." University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Tech. Rep. 07-49, October 2007.

- For the **CMU Multi-PIE dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Gross, I. Matthews, J. Cohn, T. Kanade, and S. Baker. "Multi-pie." Image and Vision Computing, vol. 28, no. 5, pp. 807â€“813, 2010.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will allow for proper documentation and referencing in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
