To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Is Diffusion Model Safe? Severe Data Leakage via Gradient-Guided Diffusion Model" by Jiayang Meng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments using various datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will move to the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their contents or characteristics.

Upon reviewing section 4.1 (Experimental Setup), I find that the authors mention using several datasets, specifically:

1. **CIFAR_10**: This dataset consists of 32 × 32 pixel images and is commonly used for image classification tasks.
2. **CelebA-HQ**: This dataset contains high-resolution images (256 × 256 pixels) of celebrity faces, often used for tasks involving facial recognition and generation.
3. **LSUN_Bedroom**: Another high-resolution dataset (256 × 256 pixels) that contains images of bedrooms, used for various image generation tasks.
4. **LSUN_Church**: Similar to the LSUN_Bedroom dataset, this one contains images of churches, also at a resolution of 256 × 256 pixels.
5. **ImageNet**: A well-known large-scale dataset with images at a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels, widely used for training and evaluating image classification models.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each of these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **CIFAR_10**:

- **CelebA-HQ**:
  > Tero Karras, Timo Aila, Samuli Laine, and Jaakko Lehtinen. "Progressive growing of gans for improved quality, stability, and variation." arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.10196, 2017.

- **LSUN_Bedroom**:

- **LSUN_Church**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
