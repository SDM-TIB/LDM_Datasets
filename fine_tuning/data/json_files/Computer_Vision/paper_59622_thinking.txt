To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatically Predict Material Properties with Microscopic Image: Example Polymer Miscibility" by Zhilong Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors collected **517 SEM images of polymers** from literature and a database, which suggests that this is a key dataset for their study.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** and **methods sections** to gather more details about the datasets. In the introduction, the authors discuss the importance of polymer miscibility and the use of SEM images, but I need to look for specific dataset names and their sources.

In **section 2.1 (Dataset)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset they used. They mention that they extracted **8625 images from literature** and specifically focused on **517 SEM images** that describe the miscibility of polymer blends. They also reference the **PoLyInfo database**, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's origin.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the **PoLyInfo database** and provides a citation for it in the references section. The citation for the PoLyInfo database is:

- **PoLyInfo Database**: Otsuka, S.; Kuwajima, I.; Hosoya, J.; Xu, Y.; Yamazaki, M. In *PoLyInfo: Polymer Database for Polymeric Materials Design*, 2011 International Conference on Emerging Intelligent Data and Web Technologies, 7-9 Sept. 2011; pp 22-29.

Additionally, the authors mention that the SEM images were collected from various literature sources. I will need to identify specific papers that contributed to the dataset. They reference two specific studies for SEM images:

1. **Calvão et al. (2005)**: Calvão, P. S.; Yee, M.; Demarquette, N. R. *Effect of composition on the linear viscoelastic behavior and morphology of PMMA/PS and PMMA/PP blends*. Polymer 2005, 46 (8), 2610-2620.

2. **Aravind et al. (2009)**: Aravind, I.; Eichhorn, K.-J.; Komber, H.; Jehnichen, D.; Zafeiropoulos, N. E.; Ahn, K. H.; Grohens, Y.; Stamm, M.; Thomas, S. *A Study on Reaction-Induced Miscibility of Poly(trimethylene terephthalate)/Polycarbonate Blends*. J. Phys. Chem. B 2009, 113 (6), 1569-1578.

With these citations, I have now gathered the necessary information about the datasets used in the study. I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
