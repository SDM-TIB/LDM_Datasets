To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Segment Any Change" by Zhuo Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors perform extensive experiments on several change detection datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of capturing global changes via remote sensing, hinting at the datasets used for this purpose.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly list four datasets used for evaluation:

1. **LEVIR-CD**: This dataset is referenced as a building-centric change detection dataset. I will need to find the full citation in the references section.

2. **S2Looking**: Another building-centric dataset mentioned for change detection. I will also look for its citation.

3. **xView2**: This dataset is noted as a binary change detection dataset. I will check the references for its full citation.

4. **SECOND**: This dataset is described as a multi-class urban change detection dataset. I will find its citation as well.

After identifying these datasets, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:

- For **LEVIR-CD**, the citation is:
  > Chen, H., & Shi, Z. (2020). A spatial-temporal attention-based method and a new dataset for remote sensing image change detection. *Remote Sensing*, 12(10), 1662.

- For **S2Looking**, the citation is:
  > Shen, L., Lu, Y., Chen, H., Wei, H., Xie, D., Yue, J., Chen, R., Lv, S., & Jiang, B. (2021). S2looking: A satellite side-looking dataset for building change detection. *Remote Sensing*, 13(24), 5094.

- For **xView2**, the citation is:
  > Gupta, R., Hosfelt, R., Sajeev, S., Patel, N., Goodman, B., Doshi, J., Heim, E., Choset, H., & Gaston, M. (2019). xbd: A dataset for assessing building damage from satellite imagery. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.09296*.

- For **SECOND**, the citation is:
  > Yang, K., Xia, G.-S., Liu, Z., Du, B., Yang, W., Pelillo, M., & Zhang, L. (2021). Asymmetric siamese networks for semantic change detection in aerial images. *IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing*, 60, 1-18.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
