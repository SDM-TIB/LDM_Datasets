To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generate E-commerce Product Background by Integrating Category Commonality and Personalized Style" by Haohan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the construction of a dataset called **BG60k**, which is a significant indicator that I should look for more details about this dataset throughout the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (BG60k)**, where the authors provide a comprehensive description of the dataset. Here, they mention that BG60k consists of over 60,000 product images from more than 2,000 categories. They also detail the criteria for selecting images, such as ensuring high click-through rates and the absence of text or human bodies in the images.

In **section 4.2 (Dataset Construction and Analysis)**, the authors elaborate on the dataset's construction process, emphasizing the quality and relevance of the images collected from a famous e-commerce platform. They also mention the creation of two additional testing datasets: **BG1k** and **BG-pair**. 

1. **BG60k**: This dataset includes 63,293 advertising images across 2,032 categories, with each image associated with its category name and product masks. The dataset aims to facilitate research in e-commerce product background generation.

2. **BG1k**: This is a testing dataset consisting of 1,000 products and their original backgrounds from over 200 categories, designed to evaluate the generated backgrounds against the original ones.

3. **BG-pair**: Another testing dataset that includes 1,600 pairs of product images and reference images, used to assess the ability to generate backgrounds with personalized styles.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since BG60k is a newly constructed dataset by the authors, it may not have a separate citation in the references. Instead, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **BG60k**:
  > Haohan Wang, Wei Feng, Yang Lu, Yaoyu Li, Zheng Zhang, Jingjing Lv, Xin Zhu, Junjie Shen, Zhangang Lin, Lixing Bo, Jingping Shao. *Generate E-commerce Product Background by Integrating Category Commonality and Personalized Style*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2023.

- For **BG1k** and **BG-pair**, since they are subsets of BG60k and described in the same paper, I will reference them similarly:
  > Haohan Wang, Wei Feng, Yang Lu, Yaoyu Li, Zheng Zhang, Jingjing Lv, Xin Zhu, Junjie Shen, Zhangang Lin, Lixing Bo, Jingping Shao. *Generate E-commerce Product Background by Integrating Category Commonality and Personalized Style*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2023.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
