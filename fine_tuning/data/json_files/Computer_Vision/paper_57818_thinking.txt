To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3D Highlighter: Localizing Regions on 3D Shapes via Text Descriptions" by Dale Decatur et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will move on to the introduction.

Next, I will carefully read through the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss their method and its applications but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **method** section, where the authors describe their approach in detail. This section may provide insights into whether any datasets were used for training or evaluation.

In the **experiments** section, the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any subsections that explicitly mention datasets. In this paper, the authors state that they do not rely on any specific 3D datasets or annotations, which indicates that they may not have used traditional datasets for training their model.

I will also check the **related work** section, as it often references datasets used in previous studies. The authors mention several datasets, including **COSEG**, **TurboSquid**, **Thingi10K**, **Toys4k**, **ModelNet**, and **ShapeNet**. These datasets are relevant to the context of their research, even if they did not use them directly.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **references** section of the paper. Here are the citations I found:

1. **COSEG**:
   > Oliver van Kaick, Andrea Tagliasacchi, Oana Sidi, Hao Zhang, Daniel Cohen-Or, Lior Wolf, and Ghassan Hamarneh. *Prior knowledge for part correspondence*. Computer Graphics Forum, 30(2):553–562, 2011.

2. **TurboSquid**:
   > TurboSquid. *Turbosquid 3D model repository*, 2021. Available at: https://www.turbosquid.com/.

3. **Thingi10K**:

4. **Toys4k**:
   > James Matthew Rehg. *Toys4k dataset*, 2022. Available at: https://github.com/rehg-lab/lowshot-3d/shapebias/tree/main/toys4k.

5. **ModelNet**:
   > Wu, Zhirong, et al. *3D ShapeNets: A deep representation for volumetric shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 1912–1920, 2015.

6. **ShapeNet**:
   > Angel X Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, Leonidas Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qixing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Hao Su, et al. *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

After compiling this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets relevant to the research presented in the paper.
