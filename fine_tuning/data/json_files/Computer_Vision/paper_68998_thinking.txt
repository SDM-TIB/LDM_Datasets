To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Wind speed super-resolution and validation: from ERA5 to CERRA via diffusion models" by Fabio Merizzi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **CERRA** dataset and the **ERA5** dataset, indicating that these are key datasets for the study. The introduction further elaborates on the significance of these datasets in the context of climate-related tasks.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **ERA5**: This dataset is characterized as a low-resolution baseline with a spatial resolution of approximately 30 km. It provides hourly estimates of various atmospheric, land, and oceanic climate variables from 1940 to the present.

2. **CERRA**: This is identified as a high-resolution regional reanalysis dataset with a spatial resolution of about 5.5 km, specifically designed for the European region. It utilizes ERA5 as a boundary condition.

3. **IGRA V2**: This dataset is used for validation and consists of in-situ measurements from global radiosounding profiles, including temperature, humidity, and wind measurements.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **ERA5**, the citation is:
  > Hersbach, H., et al. (2018). *ERA5 hourly data on single levels from 1940 to present*. Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) Climate Data Store (CDS). Accessed on 22-11-2023.

- For **CERRA**, the citation is:
  > Schimanke, S., et al. (2021). *CERRA sub-daily regional reanalysis data for Europe on single levels from 1984 to present*. Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) Climate Data Store (CDS). https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.622a565a. Accessed on 22-11-2023.

- For **IGRA V2**, the citation is:

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
