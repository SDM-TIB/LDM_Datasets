To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simultaneously exploring multi-scale and asymmetric EEG features for emotion recognition" by Yihan Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of the **DEAP** and **DREAMER** datasets for evaluating the proposed method, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into the **Materials and Methods** section, specifically **section 2.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, I will find the following information:

1. **DEAP Dataset**: The authors describe it as a multimodal dataset presented by Koelstra et al. (2012), involving 32 healthy subjects who rated their emotional responses while watching music videos. The EEG and peripheral physiological signals were recorded, and participants rated their emotional states across four dimensions.

2. **DREAMER Dataset**: This dataset is introduced as being presented by Katsigiannis and Ramzan (2018), involving 23 subjects who watched emotional film clips while their EEG was recorded. The authors provide details about the number of electrodes used and the self-assessment ratings for emotional dimensions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **DEAP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Koelstra, S., Muhl, C., Soleymani, M., Lee, J.S., Yazdani, A., Ebrahimi, T., Pun, T., Nijholt, A., Patras, I. (2012). DEAP: A database for emotion analysis using physiological signals. *IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing*, 3(1), 18-31.

- For the **DREAMER Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Katsigiannis, S., Ramzan, N. (2018). Dreamer: A database for emotion recognition through EEG and ECG signals from wireless low-cost off-the-shelf devices. *IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics*, 22(1), 98-107.

Now that I have the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
