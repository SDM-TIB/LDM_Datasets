To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stationary Diffusion State Neural Estimation for Multiview Clustering" by Chenghua Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on several multiview datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. This section provides a clear overview of the datasets, including their characteristics and the number of classes or instances.

The datasets mentioned in this section are:

1. **BBC Sport**: A document dataset containing 544 documents across five classes (athletics, cricket, football, rugby, tennis). Two different features are extracted for each document.

2. **MSRC-v12**: An image dataset consisting of seven classes (tree, building, airplane, cow, face, car, bicycle), with 30 images in each category and six views per image.

3. **100 Leaves**: An image dataset with 100 classes of leaves, containing 16 images per class and three different features (shape, margin, texture).

4. **Three Sources**: A document dataset with 169 stories from BBC, Reuters, and the Guardian, each annotated with one of six topical labels (business, entertainment, health, politics, sport, technology).

5. **Scene-15**: A dataset comprising 4485 images across 15 scene categories, with three features extracted for each image (GIST, PHOG, LBP).

6. **Reuters**: A subset of the Reuters dataset containing 18,758 articles across six classes, with each article having five views (English, French, German, Italian, Spanish).

After identifying these datasets, I will then look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
