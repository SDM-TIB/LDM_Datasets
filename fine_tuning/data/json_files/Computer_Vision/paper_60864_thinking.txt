To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Autoencoder-based prediction of ICU clinical codes" by Tsvetan R. Yordanov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used the **MIMIC-III dataset**, which is a significant dataset in the context of their research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the problem of predicting clinical codes for ICU patients. They mention the use of autoencoders and reference the MIMIC-III dataset again, reinforcing its importance in their study.

In the **methods section**, the authors provide a detailed description of the MIMIC-III dataset. They specify that it contains 57,786 ICU hospital admissions from 46,476 patients, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's scope and relevance. They also mention the use of the **International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems version 9 (ICD9)** for coding, which is important for context but not a dataset itself.

I will also check the **results section** to confirm that the MIMIC-III dataset is indeed the primary dataset used for their experiments. The authors discuss the performance metrics derived from this dataset, which further validates its role in their research.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the MIMIC-III dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **MIMIC-III Dataset**: 
  > Johnson, A.E.W., T.J. Pollard, L. Shen, L.-w.H. Lehman, M. Feng, M. Ghassemi, et al. *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific Data, 2016. 3(1): p. 160035.

Since the ICD9 is a classification system and not a dataset, I will not include it in my dataset extraction.

Finally, I will compile the information regarding the MIMIC-III dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
