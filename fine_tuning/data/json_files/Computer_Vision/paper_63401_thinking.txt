To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Correlating Medi-Claim Service by Deep Learning Neural Networks" by Jayanthi Vajiram et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions the use of a **public dataset** for the study, which indicates that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will look closely at the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their approach to predicting organized fraud in healthcare service providers. They mention that they used a **public dataset** from Kaggle, but I need to find more specific details about this dataset, including its name and any relevant characteristics.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the outcomes of their analysis and the performance metrics, but they do not provide additional details about the dataset. Therefore, I will need to refer to the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset used in the study.

Since the paper indicates that the dataset is from Kaggle, I will search for the specific Kaggle dataset referenced in the paper. I will look for any additional information provided in the references that might point to the original source of the dataset or any related studies that utilized the same dataset.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. If the authors do not provide a specific citation for the Kaggle dataset, I will use the general citation format for datasets from Kaggle, which typically includes the dataset title, the author or organization that created it, and the URL.

Finally, I will ensure that all dataset entries are clearly documented and formatted correctly, ready for inclusion in any structured output or further analysis.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections for dataset mentions.
2. Identify the public dataset from Kaggle and any specific details about it.
3. Check the references for citations related to the dataset.
4. Compile the dataset information, including full citations.
5. Document the findings clearly for further use.
