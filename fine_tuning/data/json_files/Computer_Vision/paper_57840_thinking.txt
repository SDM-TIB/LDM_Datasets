To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Co-evolving morphology and control of soft robots using a single genome" by Fabio Tanaka and Claus Aranha, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of methods on various tasks, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section V)**, where the authors describe the tasks used for evaluation. They mention four tasks: **Walker-v0, ObstacleTraverser-v1, Climber-v2, and Thrower-v0**. I will check if these tasks are associated with specific datasets or if they are part of a larger framework or library.

In the **related work section (Section II)**, the authors reference a library called **Evogym**. I will investigate this library further, as it may contain datasets or benchmarks used for the experiments. The authors also cite previous works that may have their own datasets.

I will then look at the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or libraries mentioned. For instance, the paper cites the **Evogym** library, which is crucial for understanding the context of the experiments. The citation for Evogym is:
> Jagdeep Bhatia, Holly Jackson, Yunsheng Tian, Jie Xu, Wojciech Matusik. (2022). *Evolution Gym: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Evolving Soft Robots*.

Additionally, I will check if any other datasets are explicitly mentioned in the context of the tasks or methodologies used in the paper.

After gathering all the relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset identified in the paper.
