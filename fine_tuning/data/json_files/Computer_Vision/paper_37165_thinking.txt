To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Visual Analytics to Interpret Predictive Machine Learning Models" by Josua Krause et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of visual analytics for model interpretation but does not specify any datasets. I will then check the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that describe the visual analytics systems, as they may reference datasets used for demonstration or evaluation.

In **section 5 (Prospector)**, the authors describe a visual analytics system called Prospector, which is designed to help analysts understand predictive models. They mention that it is used in a disease prediction task based on electronic health records. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name here.

Next, I will look at **section 6 (Class Signatures)**, where the authors describe a workflow for interpreting predictive associations. They mention using a binary classifer but do not specify a dataset either.

Since the paper does not explicitly name any datasets, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. The references include various studies and methodologies related to machine learning and visual analytics, but they do not provide specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors did not provide specific datasets used in their research. They discuss concepts and systems but do not cite any particular datasets or provide full citations for them.

In conclusion, I will note that while the paper discusses the use of visual analytics in interpreting predictive models, it does not explicitly mention or provide citations for any datasets. Therefore, I will document this finding and indicate that no datasets were extracted from this paper.
