To extract datasets from the research paper titled "METEOR: A Dense, Heterogeneous, and Unstructured Traffic Dataset With Rare Behaviors" by Rohan Chandra et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** of the paper. The authors introduce the METEOR dataset, highlighting its characteristics, such as the number of videos, annotated frames, and the types of behaviors it captures. This indicates that the METEOR dataset is the primary focus of the paper.

Next, I will look into the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the motivation behind creating METEOR and compare it with existing datasets. They mention that METEOR is designed to address the limitations of other datasets in capturing rare behaviors and heterogeneous traffic patterns. This section reinforces the importance of the METEOR dataset.

I will then proceed to the **datasets section** (Section III), where the authors provide detailed information about METEOR. They describe its structure, including the number of video clips, annotated frames, bounding boxes, and the unique agent categories. This section is crucial as it contains specific details about the dataset's organization and annotations.

In the **experiments and analysis section**, the authors evaluate the performance of various models on the METEOR dataset. They discuss how existing models struggle with this dataset, further emphasizing its significance in the field of autonomous driving research.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to gather full citations for any datasets mentioned. The METEOR dataset itself is the primary dataset discussed, but the authors also reference other datasets like Argoverse, Waymo, and nuScenes in their comparisons. I will ensure to extract the full citations for these datasets as well.

The full citation for the METEOR dataset is:

In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2023.

Additionally, I will extract citations for the other datasets mentioned in the paper:
- For the Argoverse dataset:

- For the Waymo Open Motion Dataset:

- For the nuScenes dataset:
  > H. Caesar, V. Bankiti, A. H. Lang, S. Vora, V. E. Liong, Q. Xu, A. Krishnan, Y. Pan, G. Baldan, and O. Beijbom. *nuScenes: A Multimodal Dataset for Autonomous Driving*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.11027, 2019.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries and their citations for further processing or review.
