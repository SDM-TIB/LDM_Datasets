To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MA2GCN: Multi Adjacency relationship Attention Graph Convolutional Networks for Traffic Prediction using Trajectory data" by Zhengke Sun and Yuliang Ma, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiment sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of vehicle trajectory data for traffic prediction, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that traditional traffic prediction methods rely on sensor data and that their work focuses on trajectory data. This indicates a shift in dataset type but does not specify any datasets yet.

Next, I will look closely at the **experiment section**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for validation. They state that they validate their model on the **Shanghai taxi GPS trajectory dataset**. The description provided indicates that this dataset includes GPS trajectory data from 4316 taxis in Shanghai, collected on February 20, 2007, with specific fields for each taxi's data.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Shanghai taxi GPS trajectory dataset. However, the paper does not provide a separate citation for this dataset, as it is described as being collected by the Smart City Research Group of HKUST. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is associated with this research group.

The details I have gathered about the dataset are as follows:

1. **Shanghai taxi GPS trajectory dataset**: This dataset contains GPS trajectory data of 4316 taxis in Shanghai, collected on February 20, 2007. Each entry includes fields such as taxi ID, timestamp, longitude, latitude, instantaneous speed, angle, and current status.

Since there is no formal citation provided in the references for the dataset, I will mention the source as the Smart City Research Group of HKUST.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and source. This will help in organizing the extracted information for further use or analysis.
