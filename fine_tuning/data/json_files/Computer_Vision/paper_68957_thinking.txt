To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Manifold GCN: Diffusion-based Convolutional Neural Network for Manifold-valued Graphs" by Martin Hanik et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions "numerical examples on synthetic data as well as on triangle meshes of the right hippocampus to classify Alzheimer’s disease," indicating that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In the **experiments section**, the authors describe two main datasets:

1. **Synthetic Graphs Dataset**: This dataset consists of graphs created using three different algorithms: Erdős-Rényi, Barabási-Albert, and Watts-Strogatz. Each graph has 100 nodes, and the number of edges varies based on the algorithm used. The authors mention that the dataset is balanced, containing the same number of graphs for each algorithm.

2. **Hippocampus Mesh Dataset**: This dataset includes 60 subjects diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and 60 cognitive normal (CN) controls. The data is derived from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, which provides magnetic resonance images of brains with segmented hippocampi. The authors use triangle meshes derived from these images, with vertex normals as features.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Synthetic Graphs Dataset**, the authors reference the benchmark for graph classification algorithms, which is likely a compilation of datasets used in previous works. However, they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset in the references.

- For the **Hippocampus Mesh Dataset**, the authors mention the ADNI database, which can be cited as:
  > Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. "ADNI Database." [Online]. Available: http://adni.loni.usc.edu/

Since the synthetic dataset does not have a specific citation, I will note that it is based on established algorithms rather than a formal dataset with a citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
