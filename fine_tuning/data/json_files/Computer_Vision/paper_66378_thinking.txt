To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Collaborative Word-based Pre-trained Item Representation for Transferable Recommendation" by Shenghao Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on multiple public datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, they mention using mixed-domain user interaction data for pre-training and several downstream datasets for evaluation. 

In **Table II**, the authors provide statistics for the datasets used, which include:

1. **Pre-trained Datasets**:
   - **Grocery and Gourmet Food**: A dataset from the Amazon dataset containing user interactions related to food items.
   - **Home and Kitchen**: Another dataset from Amazon focusing on home and kitchen products.
   - **CDs and Vinyl**: This dataset includes interactions related to music products.
   - **Kindle Store**: A dataset for e-books and related items.
   - **Movies and TV**: This dataset includes interactions related to movies and television shows.

2. **Downstream Datasets**:
   - **Industrial and Scientific**: A dataset from Amazon that includes user interactions with industrial and scientific products.
   - **Prime Pantry**: Another Amazon dataset focused on grocery items.
   - **Musical Instruments**: This dataset includes interactions related to musical instruments.
   - **Arts, Crafts and Sewing**: A dataset for arts and crafts products.
   - **Office Products**: This dataset includes user interactions with office supplies.
   - **Online Retail**: A UK online shopping dataset containing transaction records.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are typically found in the references of the papers that introduced them. 

For example, the citation for the **Grocery and Gourmet Food** dataset might be:
> J. Ni, J. Li, and J. McAuley. "Justifying recommendations using distantly-labeled reviews and fine-grained aspects." In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), 2019.

I will repeat this process for each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring that I accurately capture the full citation for each dataset.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.
