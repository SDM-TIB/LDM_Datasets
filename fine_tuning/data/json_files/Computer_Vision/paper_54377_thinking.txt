To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SPI-GAN: Denoising Diffusion GANs with Straight-Path Interpolations" by Jinsung Jeon and Noseong Park, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on **CIFAR-10** and **CelebA-HQ-256**, which suggests these are the datasets used.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors provide details about the datasets used for evaluation. In section 4, they explicitly mention:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset is described as having a resolution of 32x32 pixels and is commonly used for image classification tasks. 

2. **CelebA-HQ-256**: This dataset contains high-resolution images (256x256 pixels) of celebrity faces, which is often used for generative tasks in deep learning.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *The CIFAR-10 dataset*. online: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/kriz/cifar.html, 55(5), 2014.

- For **CelebA-HQ-256**, the citation is:
  > Tero Karras, Timo Aila, Samuli Laine, and Jaakko Lehtinen. *Progressive growing of GANs for improved quality, stability, and variation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.10196, 2018.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
