To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DA-DGCEX: Ensuring Validity of Deep Guided Counterfactual Explanations with Distribution-Aware Autoencoder Loss" by Jokin Labaien et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of deep learning and counterfactual explanations but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of explainable AI but do not mention specific datasets. I will then look into **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments.

In **section 5.1**, the authors specifically mention the **MNIST dataset**. They describe it as a widely used dataset for handwritten digit classification, containing 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. They note that 60,000 images were used for training and 10,000 for evaluation.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- **MNIST Dataset**:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J. Burges. *MNIST Handwritten Digit Database*. 2010.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section to find specific datasets used.
3. Identify the MNIST dataset and its details.
4. Retrieve the full citation from the references.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately extract and cite the dataset used in the research paper.
