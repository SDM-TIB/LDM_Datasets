To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Multimodal Instance Segmentation Guided by Natural Language Queries" by Edgar Margffoy-Tuay et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors compare their method against state-of-the-art approaches in four standard datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will navigate to **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **ReferIt**: A crowd-sourced database containing images and referring expressions to objects in those images, with 130,525 expressions referring to 96,654 distinct objects across 19,894 photographs.

2. **UNC**: Collected interactively in the ReferIt game, this dataset consists of 142,209 referring expressions for 50,000 objects in 19,994 images.

3. **UNC+**: Similar to UNC but with an additional restriction that expressions must be based only on appearance rather than location, containing 142,209 referring expressions.

4. **GRef**: Collected on Amazonâ€™s Mechanical Turk, this dataset contains 85,474 referring expressions for 54,822 objects in 26,711 images.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are as follows:

- For **ReferIt**, the citation is:
  > Kazemzadeh, S., Ordonez, V., Matten, M., & Berg, T.L. (2014). *ReferIt game: Referring to objects in photographs of natural scenes*. In EMNLP.

- For **UNC**, the citation is:
  > Yu, L., Poirson, P., Yang, S., Berg, A.C., & Berg, T.L. (2016). *Modeling context in referring expressions*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

- For **UNC+**, the citation is the same as UNC since it is an extension of that dataset:
  > Yu, L., Poirson, P., Yang, S., Berg, A.C., & Berg, T.L. (2016). *Modeling context in referring expressions*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

- For **GRef**, the citation is:
  > Mao, J., Huang, J., Toshev, A., Camburu, O., Yuille, A.L., & Murphy, K. (2016). *Generation and comprehension of unambiguous object descriptions*. In Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the specified requirements, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.
