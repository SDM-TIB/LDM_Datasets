To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Traffic Signal Prediction on Transportation Networks Using Spatio-Temporal Correlations on Graphs" by Semin Kwak, Nikolas Geroliminis, and Pascal Frossard, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for validation or testing.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference existing datasets. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks that are relevant to their work.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any subsections that detail the datasets used for training and testing the proposed model. This section typically contains the most comprehensive information about the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any preprocessing steps taken.

I will also check the **figures and tables** throughout the paper, as they may summarize dataset information or provide visual representations of the data used in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For this paper, I expect to find at least one dataset mentioned, likely the **PEMS-BAY dataset**, which is commonly used in traffic prediction studies. I will look for the citation details, which typically include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation in a clear and organized manner.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information for structured output, ensuring that it is ready for review or further processing.
