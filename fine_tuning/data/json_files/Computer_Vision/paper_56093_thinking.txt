To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Automated Audio Captioning via Fusion of Low- and High-Dimensional Features" by Jianyuan Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that their experimental results show that their model achieves the best performance on the **Clotho** and **AudioCaps** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically section III, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. They mention:

1. **Clotho Dataset**: This dataset consists of audio clips sourced from the Freesound archive, with each clip having five captions annotated by different individuals. The authors specify that the Clotho v2 version is used, which includes 3,839 development clips, 1,045 validation clips, and 1,045 evaluation clips. They also mention that the training dataset consists of 4,884 audio clips.

2. **AudioCaps Dataset**: This is described as the largest audio captioning dataset, containing 50,000 audio clips, each lasting 10 seconds. The dataset is divided into three parts: 49,274 clips for training, 497 for validation, and 957 for testing. Each audio clip has one caption in the training dataset and five captions in the validation and test datasets.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Clotho Dataset**, the citation is:
  > K. Drossos, S. Lipping, and T. Virtanen. "Clotho: An audio captioning dataset." In IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2020, pp. 736–740.

- For the **AudioCaps Dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. D. Kim, B. Kim, H. Lee, and G. Kim. "AudioCaps: Generating captions for audios in the wild." In Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1, 2019, pp. 119–132.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will prepare the information for any required structured output or further analysis.
