To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Custom Extended Sobel Filters" by Victor Bogdan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of edge detection algorithms and mentions comparisons using different image sets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors reference various applications of the Sobel filter and edge detection. They mention using the **BSDS500 benchmark tool** and image sets from **Arbelaez et al. (2011)** for comparison results. This indicates that BSDS500 is a dataset used in their experiments.

In the **simulation results section**, the authors explicitly state that they used the **BSDS500 dataset** for their comparisons. They describe it as containing 500 test images split into three different sets, which is crucial information for the dataset entry.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the BSDS500 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Arbelaez, P., Maire, M., Fowlkes, C., and Malik, J. (2011). *Contour detection and hierarchical image segmentation*. IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell., 33(5):898â€“916.

Since the paper primarily discusses the use of the BSDS500 dataset for their experiments, I will focus on this dataset for extraction.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
