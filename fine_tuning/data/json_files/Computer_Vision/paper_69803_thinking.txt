To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Balanced Data Sampling for Language Model Training with Clustering" by Yunfan Shao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to get an overview of the paper's focus and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions the use of **Open-Orca** and **Proof-Pile-2** datasets, indicating that these are likely the primary datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experimental Setups)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. In **subsection 4.2 (Training Datasets)**, the authors explicitly mention:

1. **Open-Orca**: This dataset is described as an open-source implementation of Orca, which collects outputs from GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for various NLP tasks, totaling about 1 billion tokens.

2. **Proof-Pile-2**: This dataset is aimed at enhancing mathematical reasoning capabilities and consists of three components: code files, web pages, and scientific papers, leading to a total of 55 billion tokens.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **Open-Orca**:
  > Lianmin Zheng, Wei-Lin Chiang, Ying Sheng, Siyuan Zhuang, Zhanghao Wu, Yonghao Zhuang, Zi Lin, Zhuohan Li, Dacheng Li, Eric P. Xing, Hao Zhang, Joseph E. Gonzalez, and Ion Stoica. *Judging llm-as-a-judge with mt-bench and chatbot arena*. CoRR, abs/2306.05685, 2023.

- For **Proof-Pile-2**:
  > Zhangir Azerbayev, Hailey Schoelkopf, Keiran Paster, Marco Dos Santos, Stephen McAleer, Albert Q. Jiang, Jia Deng, Stella Biderman, and Sean Welleck. *Llemma: An open language model for mathematics*. CoRR, abs/2310.10631, 2023.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, facilitating further exploration or replication of the study.
