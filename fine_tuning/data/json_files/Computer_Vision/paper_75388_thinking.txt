To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Chromosomal Structural Abnormality Diagnosis by Homologous Similarity" by Juren Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses experiments on real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Preliminaries)**, particularly the **subsection 2.1 (Dataset and Preprocessing)**. This section is likely to provide detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors mention that they collected data from four hospitals, specifying the number of chromosomes from both patients with structural abnormalities and healthy individuals. 

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Dataset from Hospital #1 (Hos#1)**: Contains 14,196 pairs of normal homologous chromosomes and 428 pairs of homologous chromosomes with structural abnormalities.
2. **Dataset from Hospital #2 (Hos#2)**: Contains 14,840 pairs of normal homologous chromosomes and 457 pairs of homologous chromosomes with structural abnormalities.
3. **Dataset from Hospital #3 (Hos#3)**: Contains 16,920 pairs of normal homologous chromosomes and 590 pairs of homologous chromosomes with structural abnormalities.
4. **Dataset from Hospital #4 (Hos#4)**: Contains 13,496 pairs of normal homologous chromosomes and 378 pairs of homologous chromosomes with structural abnormalities.
5. **Dataset from healthy individuals**: Contains 458,876 pairs of homologous chromosomes from 1,581 healthy individuals.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from real-world patient data and not publicly available datasets, they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets. Instead, I will note that the datasets are collected from specific hospitals and provide a general citation for the paper itself.

The citation for the paper is:
> Juren Li, Fanzhe Fu, Ran Wei, Yifei Sun, Zeyu Lai, Ning Song, Xin Chen, and Yang Yang. 2024. Chromosomal Structural Abnormality Diagnosis by Homologous Similarity. In Proceedings of the 30th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD ’24), August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 12 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3637528.3671642

Now, I will compile the dataset information along with the citation into a structured format for clarity.

1. **Dataset from Hospital #1 (Hos#1)**:
   - Description: 14,196 pairs of normal homologous chromosomes and 428 pairs of homologous chromosomes with structural abnormalities.
   - Citation: Juren Li et al. (2024).

2. **Dataset from Hospital #2 (Hos#2)**:
   - Description: 14,840 pairs of normal homologous chromosomes and 457 pairs of homologous chromosomes with structural abnormalities.
   - Citation: Juren Li et al. (2024).

3. **Dataset from Hospital #3 (Hos#3)**:
   - Description: 16,920 pairs of normal homologous chromosomes and 590 pairs of homologous chromosomes with structural abnormalities.
   - Citation: Juren Li et al. (2024).

4. **Dataset from Hospital #4 (Hos#4)**:
   - Description: 13,496 pairs of normal homologous chromosomes and 378 pairs of homologous chromosomes with structural abnormalities.
   - Citation: Juren Li et al. (2024).

5. **Dataset from healthy individuals**:
   - Description: 458,876 pairs of homologous chromosomes from 1,581 healthy individuals.
   - Citation: Juren Li et al. (2024).

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that it is presented clearly and accurately for any further processing or review.
