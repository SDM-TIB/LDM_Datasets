To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Few-shot Fine-tuning is All You Need for Source-free Domain Adaptation" by Suho Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on various domain adaptation benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention five benchmark datasets:

1. **Office31**: This dataset consists of images from three domains (Amazon, DSLR, and Webcam) with a total of 4,652 images across 31 categories.

2. **OfficeHome**: This dataset contains images from four domains (Art, Clipart, Product, and Real World) with a total of 15,500 images across 65 categories.

3. **VisDA-C 2017**: A large-scale dataset for synthetic-to-real domain adaptation, containing 152,000 synthetic images for the source domain and 55,000 real-world images for the target domain across 12 categories.

4. **VLCS**: This dataset is a combination of subsets from four different datasets (PASCAL VOC2007, LabelMe, Caltech-101, and SUN09), containing 10,729 images across 5 categories.

5. **TerraIncognita**: This dataset consists of photographs of wild animals captured at different locations, comprising four domains (L100, L38, L43, and L46) with a total of 24,788 images across 10 categories.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
