To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Cross-Modal Alignment for Multi-Person 3D Pose Estimation" by Jogendra Nath Kundu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention key datasets used for evaluation or training. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of multi-person 3D pose estimation and may reference datasets that are commonly used in this field. I will look for specific names of datasets or any references to prior works that might indicate the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly where the authors describe their approach and any datasets they utilized. In this paper, they mention two types of datasets: unpaired multi-person images and synthesized multi-person 3D poses. 

1. **MuCo-3DHP Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a training dataset created by compositing images from the MPI-INF-3DHP dataset. It is used for training purposes in the experiments.
   
2. **MuPoTS-3D Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as a test set for evaluating the multi-person 3D pose estimation performance. It contains sequences capturing multiple persons in various poses.

3. **Human 3.6M Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a source of single-person 3D poses collected in a controlled environment, which is used for comparison in the experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MuCo-3DHP**, the citation is:
  > Mehta, D., Sotnychenko, O., Mueller, F., Xu, W., Sridhar, S., Pons-Moll, G., & Theobalt, C. (2018). Single-shot multi-person 3D pose estimation from monocular RGB. In *3DV*.

- For **MuPoTS-3D**, the citation is:
  > Mehta, D., Sotnychenko, O., Mueller, F., Xu, W., Sridhar, S., Pons-Moll, G., & Theobalt, C. (2018). MuPoTS-3D: A multi-person 3D pose estimation dataset. In *3DV*.

- For **Human 3.6M**, the citation is:
  > Ionescu, C., Papava, D., Olaru, V., & Sminchisescu, C. (2014). Human3.6M: Large scale datasets and predictive methods for 3D human sensing in natural environments. *TPAMI*, 36(7), 1325-1339.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their full citations.
