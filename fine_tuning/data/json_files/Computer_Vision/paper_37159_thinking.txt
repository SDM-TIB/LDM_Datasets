To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recurrent neural network models for disease name recognition using domain invariant features" by Sunil Kumar Sahu and Ashish Anand, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors compare their models with state-of-the-art results on the **NCBI disease dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the **NCBI dataset**. They describe it as the most comprehensive publicly available dataset annotated with disease mentions, categorized into four types: specific disease, disease class, composite disease, and modifier. This section provides essential details about the dataset's purpose and structure.

The authors also reference the **AZDC dataset** as an extension of the NCBI dataset, which is important to note as it provides context for the NCBI dataset's development. However, the primary dataset used in their experiments is the NCBI dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the NCBI dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **NCBI disease dataset**, the citation is:
  > Rezarta Islamaj Dogan, Robert Leaman, and Zhiyong Lu. *NCBI disease corpus: A resource for disease name recognition and concept normalization*. Journal of Biomedical Informatics, 47:1â€“10, 2014.

The authors also mention that the NCBI dataset was manually annotated by medical practitioners, which adds credibility to its use in their research.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the NCBI dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. 

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured.
