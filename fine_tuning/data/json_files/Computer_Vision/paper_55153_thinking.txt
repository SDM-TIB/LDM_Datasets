To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Riemannian Diffusion Models" by Chin-Wei Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate the expressive power of their models on various smooth manifolds, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors describe their empirical validation on several datasets:

1. **Earth and Climate Science Events Dataset**: This dataset includes events such as volcanoes, earthquakes, floods, and fires. The authors reference the sources for these datasets, which is crucial for citation.

2. **Protein Dataset**: The authors mention using a list of 500 high-resolution proteins compiled by Lovell et al. (2003) and RNA sequences from Murray et al. (2003). This indicates that there are specific datasets related to protein and RNA structures.

3. **Synthetic Datasets**: The authors also refer to synthetic datasets used for testing their models on hyperbolic manifolds, which may not have specific citations but are important to note.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **Earth and Climate Science Events Dataset**, the citations are:
  > NGDC/WDS. Ncei/wds global significant earthquake database. https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/metadata/landing-page/bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ngdc.mgg.hazards:G012153, 2022a.
  > NGDC/WDS. Ncei/wds global significant volcanic eruptions database. https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/metadata/landing-page/bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ngdc.mgg.hazards:G10147, 2022b.
  > Brakenridge, G. Global active archive of large flood events. http://floodobservatory.colorado.edu/Archives/index.html, 2017.
  > EOSDIS. Land, atmosphere near real-time capability for eos (lance) system operated by nasa’s earth science data and information system (esdis). https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/firms/active-fire-data, 2020.

- For the **Protein Dataset**, the citations are:
  > Lovell, S. C., Davis, I. W., Arendall III, W. B., De Bakker, P. I., Word, J. M., Prisant, M. G., Richardson, J. S., and Richardson, D. C. Structure validation by Cα geometry: φ, ψ and Cβ deviation. *Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics*, 50(3):437–450, 2003.
  > Murray, L. J., Arendall, W. B., Richardson, D. C., and Richardson, J. S. RNA backbone is rotameric. *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, 100(24):13904–13909, 2003.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
