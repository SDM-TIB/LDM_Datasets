To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Synthesis with Explicit Dependencies" by Priyanka Golia, Subhajit Roy, and Kuldeep S. Meel, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work and may mention datasets used for evaluation or comparison.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may mention specific datasets that are relevant to their work. I will look for any phrases that indicate the use of datasets, such as "we evaluated our method on," "we used the following datasets," or similar expressions.

Then, I will examine the **experimental results section** in detail, as this section typically contains information about the datasets used for experiments, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics. I will look for specific names of datasets, the number of instances, and any other pertinent details that describe the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "DQBF track of QBFEval," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references section to provide a complete citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset and its citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a comprehensive overview that includes all necessary citations.
