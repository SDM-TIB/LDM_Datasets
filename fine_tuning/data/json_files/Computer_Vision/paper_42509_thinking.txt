To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Realistic River Image Synthesis using Deep Generative Adversarial Networks" by Akshat Gautam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the creation of an extensive repository of overhead river images for training, which indicates that datasets are involved. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of having access to large repositories of river data for hydrological research, hinting at the datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Methodology)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **Dataset A**: This dataset consists of 1,000 images sampled from the Mississippi, Missouri, and Iowa Rivers, captured at a resolution of 1024x1024. The authors applied data augmentation techniques to increase the dataset size to 10,000 images.

2. **Dataset B**: This is a larger dataset comprising 110,000 images collected from major rivers in the United States, including the Mississippi, Missouri, Colorado, Rio Grande, and Arkansas Rivers. Similar data augmentation techniques were applied to this dataset as well.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for Dataset A and Dataset B since they are original datasets created by the authors. Instead, I will note that these datasets will be shared with the community through a GitHub repository, as mentioned in the methodology section.

Now, I will summarize the datasets extracted:

- **Dataset A**: 1,000 images from Mississippi, Missouri, and Iowa Rivers, augmented to 10,000 images.
- **Dataset B**: 110,000 images from major rivers in the United States.

Since these datasets are original and created by the authors, I will note that they do not have traditional citations but will be available in a GitHub repository for community access.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
