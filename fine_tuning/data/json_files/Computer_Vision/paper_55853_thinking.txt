To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Human Motion Diffusion Model" by Guy Tevet et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the model achieves state-of-the-art results on leading benchmarks for text-to-motion and action-to-motion, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluation. In **subsection 4.1 (Text-to-Motion)**, they mention two datasets:

1. **HumanML3D**: This dataset is described as containing 14,616 motions annotated by 44,970 textual descriptions, derived from the AMASS and HumanAct12 collections. This dataset is crucial for evaluating text-to-motion tasks.

2. **KIT Dataset**: The authors note that this dataset contains 3,911 samples and is commonly used in text-to-motion research, making it important for their evaluations as well.

In **subsection 4.2 (Action-to-Motion)**, the authors specify two additional datasets:

1. **HumanAct12**: This dataset consists of approximately 1,200 motion clips organized into 12 action categories, with varying numbers of samples per label. It is used for evaluating action-to-motion models.

2. **UESTC**: This dataset includes 40 action classes and 25,000 samples, split into training and testing sets. It is also used for action-to-motion evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **HumanML3D**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
