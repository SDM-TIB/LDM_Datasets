To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Low-rank based motion correction followed by automatic frame selection in DT-CMR" by Fanwen Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, but I will focus on the methods section, as it typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of motion artifacts in DT-CMR imaging, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the **methods section**. Here, the authors describe the scanning process involving **12 healthy volunteers** and the imaging techniques used (STEAM and SE-EPI). However, they do not specify a named dataset at this point.

Next, I will check the **results section** for any references to datasets. The authors discuss the performance of their proposed method and compare it with an in-house workflow, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the methods or results. The references include various studies related to diffusion tensor imaging and image registration, but they do not explicitly mention a dataset name.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets or provide specific dataset names. Instead, they conducted their experiments on data collected from their own cohort of healthy volunteers.

Since there are no datasets to extract with full citations, I will summarize my findings:

1. The study involved **12 healthy volunteers** scanned using specific imaging techniques, but no named datasets were referenced.
2. The authors relied on their own data collection rather than established datasets.

In conclusion, while I have followed the necessary steps to extract datasets, this particular paper does not provide any named datasets with citations. I will document this finding for clarity in future reference.
