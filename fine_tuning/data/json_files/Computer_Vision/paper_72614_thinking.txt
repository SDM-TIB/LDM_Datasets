To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MVP-Shot: Multi-Velocity Progressive-Alignment Framework for Few-Shot Action Recognition" by Hongyu Qu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on multiple standard few-shot benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this case, they refer to four datasets: **HMDB51**, **UCF101**, **Kinetics**, and **SSv2-small**. I will take note of any specific details provided about these datasets, such as their characteristics or the number of classes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

The citations I will extract are as follows:

1. **HMDB51**:
   > Kuehne, H., Jhuang, H., Garrote, E., Poggio, T., & Serre, T. (2011). *HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 2556–2563.

2. **UCF101**:
   > Soomro, K., Zamir, A. R., & Shah, M. (2012). *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402.

3. **Kinetics**:
   > Carreira, J., & Zisserman, A. (2017). *Quo vadis, action recognition? A new model and the kinetics dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 6299–6308.

4. **SSv2-small**:
   > Goyal, R., Ebrahimi Kahou, S., Michalski, V., Materzynska, J., Westphal, S., Kim, H., Haenel, V., Freund, I., Yianilos, P., & Mueller-Freitag, M. (2017). *The “Something Something” video database for learning and evaluating visual common sense*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 5842–5850.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited in any subsequent work.
