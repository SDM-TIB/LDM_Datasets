To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Slim-neck by GSConv: A better design paradigm of detector architectures for autonomous vehicles" by Hulin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section (Section 4.1)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets they used for their experiments. They mention four datasets:

1. **WiderPerson**: A pedestrian detection benchmark dataset that includes images from various scenarios, particularly focusing on dense crowds and occlusions.

2. **PASCAL VOC 2007+12**: A well-known dataset used for object detection, which includes images and annotations for various object classes.

3. **SODA10M**: A dataset designed for testing real-world performance in traffic environments, specifically for autonomous driving applications.

4. **DOTA1.0**: A large-scale dataset for object detection in aerial images.

Next, I will check the **data availability section** to confirm the sources and access links for these datasets. The authors provide URLs for each dataset, which is crucial for proper citation.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the references section of the paper or from the provided URLs:

- For **WiderPerson**, the citation is:

- For **PASCAL VOC**, the citation is:

- For **SODA10M**, the citation is:
  > Han, J., Liang, X., Xu, H., Chen, K., Hong, L., Ye, C., Zhang, W., Li, Z., Liang, X., Xu, C. (2021). SODA10M: Towards large-scale object detection benchmark for autonomous driving. arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.11118. DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2106.11118.

- For **DOTA1.0**, the citation is:
  > Xia, G. S., Bai, X., Ding, J., Zhu, Z., Belongie, S., Luo, J., Datcu, M., Pelillo, M., Zhang, L. (2018). DOTA: A Large-Scale Dataset for Object Detection in Aerial Images. In *2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition* (CVPR), Salt Lake City, UT, USA. DOI: 10.1109/CVPR.2018.00418.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further analysis or integration into other systems or research efforts.
