To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scale-wise Convolution for Image Restoration" by Yuchen Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of scale-invariance in image restoration tasks, which suggests that they will reference specific datasets later in the paper. 

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention multiple datasets for different image restoration tasks:

1. **DIV2K Dataset**: Used for image super-resolution, consisting of 800 high-resolution images. The authors note that this dataset is relatively large and contains high-quality (2K resolution) images.

2. **Berkeley Segmentation Dataset (BSD)**: Used for image denoising, with 200 training and 200 testing images.

3. **91 images dataset**: Referenced for compression artifacts removal, along with 200 training images from the BSD dataset.

4. **Benchmark evaluation sets**: These include Set5, Set14, BSD100, and Urban100 for image super-resolution, and Set12 and BSD64 for image denoising.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **DIV2K Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **91 images dataset**, the citation is:

- For the benchmark evaluation sets (Set5, Set14, BSD100, Urban100), I will refer to the original papers that introduced these datasets:
  - **Set5**: Bevilacqua, M., Roumy, A., Guillemot, C., and Alberi-Morel, M. L. *Low-Complexity Single-Image Super-Resolution Based on Nonnegative Neighbor Embedding*. In Proceedings of the British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC), pages 135.1–135.10, 2012.
  - **Set14**: Zeyde, R., Elad, M., and Protter, M. *On Single Image Scale-Up Using Sparse Representations*. In International Conference on Curves and Surfaces, pages 711–730, 2010.
  - **BSD100**: Martin, D., Fowlkes, C., Tal, D., and Malik, J. *A Database of Human Segmented Natural Images and Its Application to Evaluating Segmentation Algorithms and Measuring Ecological Statistics*.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details for future reference or processing.
