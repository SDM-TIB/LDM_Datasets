To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepRepair: Style-Guided Repairing for DNNs in the Real-world Operational Environment" by Bing Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental design sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or experimentation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research problem.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental design section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. The authors mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset** as the training dataset and generating multiple failure datasets based on various degradation factors. 

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The CIFAR-10 dataset is a well-known dataset, and its citation is as follows:
- **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset of images*. 2009. [Online]. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

Additionally, the paper mentions generating 15 failure datasets based on different degradation factors, but these are not standard datasets with specific citations. Instead, they are derived from the CIFAR-10 dataset, so I will note that they are based on CIFAR-10 but do not have separate citations.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset and clearly indicate that the failure datasets are derived from it without separate citations.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
