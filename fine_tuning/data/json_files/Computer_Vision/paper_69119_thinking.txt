To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Task-Oriented Diffusion Model Compression" by Geonung Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of their method to **InstructPix2Pix** and **StableSR**, which suggests that these may involve specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as it often contains detailed information about the datasets used for validation and testing. In Section 4.1, the authors mention that they validate their method using **InstructPix2Pix** and **StableSR**, but I need to confirm if specific datasets are referenced.

In the **implementation details** subsection of Section 4, the authors state that they utilized the **synthetic DIV2K validation set** for quantitative comparisons in StableSR. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **DIV2K dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Eirikur Agustsson and Radu Timofte. *Ntire 2017 challenge on single image super-resolution: Dataset and study*. In The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) Workshops, 2017.

Additionally, I will note that while the paper discusses **InstructPix2Pix** and **StableSR**, they are not datasets themselves but rather models or methods. Therefore, I will focus on the **DIV2K dataset** as the primary dataset mentioned.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with its full citation, ensuring that it is ready for any structured output or further processing.
