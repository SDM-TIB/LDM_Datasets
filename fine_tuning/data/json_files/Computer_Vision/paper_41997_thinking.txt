To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "A Robust Pose Transformational GAN for Pose Guided Person Image Synthesis" by Arnab Karmakar and Deepak Mishra, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on two large datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **DeepFashion**: This dataset consists of 52,712 in-shop clothes images and 200,000 cross-pose/scale pairs, with images of 256×256 resolution. The authors follow a standard split to create a training set of 146,680 pairs of images of the same person in different poses.

2. **Market-1501**: This dataset contains 32,668 images of 1,501 persons, with significant variations in pose, illumination, viewpoint, and background. The images are of size 128×64, and the authors construct a training set of 439,420 pairs of images of the same person in different poses.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For **DeepFashion**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Qiu, S., Wang, X., Tang, X. (2016). *Deepfashion: Powering robust clothes recognition and retrieval with rich annotations*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 1096–1104.

- For **Market-1501**, the citation is:
  > Zheng, L., Shen, L., Tian, L., Wang, S., Wang, J., Tian, Q. (2015). *Scalable person re-identification: A benchmark*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 1116–1124.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
