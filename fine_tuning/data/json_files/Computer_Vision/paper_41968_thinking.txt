To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Water Supply Prediction Based on Initialized Attention Residual Network" by Yuhao Long et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **WSSS Dataset**: This dataset was collected from an area in the southwest district of Shanghai, covering the time period from September 4, 2016, to May 4, 2019. The authors specify that the first two years of historical flow records were used for training, while the remaining data served as the test set.

2. **WSCS Dataset**: This dataset was collected in real-time from several senior stations across the central district of Shanghai, covering the period from January 1, 2017, to September 1, 2019. The authors used 80% of the flow data for training and the remaining 20% for testing.

3. **WSRS Dataset**: This dataset was collected from a reservoir in Shanghai, aggregated into hourly intervals from every second data sample. The time range for this dataset is from October 23, 2018, to September 24, 2019.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that these three datasets were used to evaluate their proposed model, which reinforces the importance of these datasets in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely proprietary or internal datasets collected by the authors or their institution. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are described in the paper but do not have external citations.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **WSSS Dataset**: Collected from the southwest district of Shanghai, covering September 4, 2016, to May 4, 2019. Training set consists of the first two years of historical flow records.

2. **WSCS Dataset**: Collected in real-time from the central district of Shanghai, covering January 1, 2017, to September 1, 2019. 80% of the data used for training, 20% for testing.

3. **WSRS Dataset**: Collected from a reservoir in Shanghai, aggregated into hourly intervals from October 23, 2018, to September 24, 2019.

Since these datasets do not have formal citations, I will note that they are described in the paper and are part of the authors' research contributions.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset descriptions into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
