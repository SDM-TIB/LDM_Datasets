To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Government intervention modeling in microeconomic company market evolution" by Michał Chorowski and Ryszard Kutner, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and subsequent sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the impact of technology and government intervention on market dynamics but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **methodology** section, where they describe their model and simulations. Here, they mention using Monte Carlo simulations but do not provide specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **results** section, where the authors present findings from their simulations. They discuss various scenarios of government intervention but again do not reference any external datasets. 

Finally, I will check the **conclusion** section to see if they summarize any datasets used or referenced throughout the paper. However, it appears that the authors primarily focus on theoretical modeling and simulation results rather than utilizing external datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets or provide citations for them, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none are present.

In summary, I will document my findings as follows:
- No datasets were identified in the paper "Government intervention modeling in microeconomic company market evolution" by Michał Chorowski and Ryszard Kutner.
