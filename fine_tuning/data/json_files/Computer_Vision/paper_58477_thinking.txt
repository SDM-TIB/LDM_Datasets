To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion Model for Generative Image Denoising" by Yutong Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the diffusion model for image denoising and hints at the use of benchmark datasets for evaluation. This suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention using two benchmark datasets: **Kodak dataset** and **CSet9** for evaluation. They also reference **DIV2K** and **CBSD500** as training datasets. 

I will then gather details about each dataset:

1. **Kodak Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for image processing tasks, particularly in denoising and super-resolution. It consists of a collection of images that serve as a standard benchmark.

2. **CSet9**: This dataset is also used for image denoising tasks, providing a set of images for testing the performance of denoising algorithms.

3. **DIV2K Dataset**: This dataset is widely used for image super-resolution tasks and consists of high-quality images.

4. **CBSD500 Dataset**: This dataset is a collection of images used for various image processing tasks, including denoising.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further research and validation of the findings.
