To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretable Representation Learning of Cardiac MRI via Attribute Regularization" by Maxime Di Folco et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of "short-axis cardiac Magnetic Resonance images of the UK Biobank," indicating that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.3 (Dataset and Implementation details)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset used in their study. Here, they specify that they processed the Cine MRI acquisitions of the short-axis view from the UK Biobank study. They mention that they selected 5,360 subjects who self-declared not to have cardiovascular disease and describe the criteria for including subjects based on segmentation masks.

The authors also detail how the dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and usage.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the UK Biobank dataset in the **References section**. The relevant citation is:

- For the **UK Biobank** dataset, the citation is:
  > Petersen, S.E., Matthews, P.M., Francis, J.M., et al. *UK Biobankâ€™s cardiovascular magnetic resonance protocol*. J Cardiovasc Magn Reson (2016).

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information regarding the UK Biobank dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry based on the extracted information, ensuring it is ready for any structured output format that may be needed later.
