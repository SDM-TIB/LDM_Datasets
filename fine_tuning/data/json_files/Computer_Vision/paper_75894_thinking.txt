To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion Models as Optimizers for Efficient Planning in Offline RL" by Renming Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on the **D4RL benchmarks**, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors refer to the **D4RL dataset**, which provides benchmark datasets for reinforcement learning. They mention using various environments from this dataset, including **Gym-locomotion, Adroit, and Kitchen** tasks. This indicates that these environments are part of the datasets used for their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the D4RL dataset. The relevant citation is:
> Fu, J., Kumar, A., Nachum, O., Tucker, G., & Levine, S. (2020). *D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219.

Additionally, I will note that the paper discusses specific environments within the D4RL dataset, such as **HalfCheetah, Hopper, and Walker2d**, but these are not separate datasets; they are tasks within the D4RL framework.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the D4RL dataset as it is the primary dataset referenced in the paper.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **D4RL dataset**: A benchmark dataset for reinforcement learning that includes various environments such as Gym-locomotion, Adroit, and Kitchen tasks.

The full citation for the D4RL dataset is:
> Fu, J., Kumar, A., Nachum, O., Tucker, G., & Levine, S. (2020). *D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219.

With this information, I am ready to create the dataset entry in the required format.
