To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Weakly Supervised Convolutional LSTM Approach for Tool Tracking in Laparoscopic Videos" by Chinedu Innocent Nwoye et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their approach on a specific dataset, which is a good starting point.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of surgical tool tracking and mention that their method is evaluated on the **Cholec80 dataset**. This is a clear indication that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used. Here, they describe the **Cholec80 dataset** as consisting of 80 videos of cholecystectomy surgeries, recorded at a frame rate of 25 fps and downsampled to 1 fps for binary presence annotations. They also mention the resolution of the videos and how they are split into training, validation, and testing sets.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citation for the **Cholec80 dataset** is as follows:
> Twinanda, A.P., Shehata, S., Mutter, D., Marescaux, J., De Mathelin, M., Padoy, N. "Endonet: A deep architecture for recognition tasks on laparoscopic videos." *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 36(1), 86â€“97, 2017.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the information about the dataset:

1. **Cholec80 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 80 videos of laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgeries, with binary presence annotations for 7 surgical tools. The videos are recorded at 25 fps and downsampled to 1 fps for annotation purposes. The dataset is split into training (40 videos), validation (10 videos), and testing (30 videos) sets.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included.
