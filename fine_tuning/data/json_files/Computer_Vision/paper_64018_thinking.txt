To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dual-Decoder Consistency via Pseudo-Labels Guided Data Augmentation for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation" by Yuanbin Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the method is evaluated on three representative medical image segmentation datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset and Preprocessing)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will look for explicit mentions of dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of images, and any preprocessing steps.

In this section, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **Pancreas-CT dataset**: This dataset consists of 82 3D abdominal contrast-enhanced CT scans. The authors provide details about the imaging equipment, resolution, and how the dataset was split into training and testing sets.

2. **LA (Left Atrium) dataset**: This dataset includes 154 gadolinium-enhanced MR scans, with specific details about the isotropic resolution and the number of labeled samples used for training and testing.

3. **ACDC (Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge) dataset**: This dataset comprises cardiac MR imaging samples from 100 patients, with detailed annotations for various cardiac structures.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Pancreas-CT dataset**:

- For the **LA dataset**:
  > Xiong, Z., Xia, Q., Hu, Z., Huang, N., Bian, C., Zheng, Y., Vesal, S., Ravikumar, N., Maier, A., Yang, X., et al. (2021). A global benchmark of algorithms for segmenting the left atrium from late gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. *Medical Image Analysis*, 67, 101832.

- For the **ACDC dataset**:
  > Bernard, O., Lalande, A., Zotti, C., Cervenansky, F., Yang, X., Heng, P.A., Cetin, I., Lekadir, K., Camara, O., Ballester, M.A.G., et al. (2018). Deep Learning Techniques for Automatic MRI Cardiac Multi-Structures Segmentation and Diagnosis: Is the Problem Solved? *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 37, 2514–2525.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
