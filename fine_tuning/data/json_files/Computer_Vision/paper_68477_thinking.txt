To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stable Generative Modeling Using Diffusion Maps" by Georg Gottwald et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses experiments on synthetic datasets, which suggests that there are datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on synthetic datasets with increasing dimensions. However, they do not specify the names of these datasets in the abstract or introduction.

I will then check the **numerical experiments section** (Section 6) for more details about the datasets used. The authors describe generating samples using synthetic datasets but do not provide specific names or citations for these datasets. They mention using a polar representation for one-dimensional manifolds and generating data from a d-dimensional standard normal distribution for multi-dimensional manifolds, but again, no specific dataset names are provided.

Since the paper primarily discusses synthetic datasets generated by the authors, there may not be formal citations for these datasets as they are not publicly available datasets but rather generated for the purpose of the experiments.

After reviewing the **references section**, I will note that there are no specific datasets cited, as the experiments rely on synthetic data created by the authors. Therefore, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Synthetic Datasets**: The authors generated synthetic datasets for their experiments, including one-dimensional and multi-dimensional datasets. These datasets are not publicly available and are created specifically for the study.

Since there are no formal citations for these synthetic datasets, I will document them as described without specific references.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that reflects the datasets used in the research, ensuring clarity and completeness in the description.
