To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Language-driven Scene Synthesis using Multi-conditional Diffusion Model" by An Dinh Vuong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by scanning the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention that they evaluate their method using specific datasets, which indicates that I should look for their names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **PRO-teXt**: This dataset is described as an extension of PROXD and PROXE, containing 200 interactions for training and testing. The authors note that it integrates text prompts with human motions.

2. **HUMANISE**: This dataset consists of 160 interactions derived from ScanNet V2, which provides excellent instance segmentation and aligns human motions with scenes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations I need to extract are:

- For **PRO-teXt**, the citation is:
  > Hassan, M., Choutas, V., Tzionas, D., & Black, M. J. (2019). Resolving 3D human pose ambiguities with 3D scene constraints. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2282â€“2292.

- For **HUMANISE**, the citation is:
  > Wang, Y., Chen, Z., Liu, Y., Zhu, W., Liang, S., & Huang, S. (2022). HUMANISE: Language-conditioned human motion generation in 3D scenes. arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.09729.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have a clear and organized representation of the datasets used in the research paper, complete with their full citations.
