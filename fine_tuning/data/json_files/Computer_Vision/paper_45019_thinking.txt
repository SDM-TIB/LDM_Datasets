To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequence-to-Sequence Load Disaggregation Using Multi-Scale Residual Neural Network" by Gan Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the algorithm is tested on a real-house public dataset, which suggests that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. In section IV.A, they state that they employed the **UK Domestic Appliance Level Electric (UK-DALE)** dataset for their experiments. This section provides details about the dataset, including its structure and the appliances involved.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the UK-DALE dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Kelly, J., & Knottenbelt, W. (2015). The UK-DALE dataset, domestic appliance-level electricity demand and whole-house demand from five UK homes. *Scientific Data*, 2(1), 150007. doi:10.1038/sdata.2015.7.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **UK-DALE Dataset**: This dataset records appliance-level power data from five houses, with active power sampled every 6 seconds. It includes various appliances such as kettles, fridges, washing machines, microwaves, and dishwashers.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the necessary details, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper referencing. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
