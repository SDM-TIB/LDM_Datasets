To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep MMD Gradient Flow without adversarial training" by Alexandre Galashov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention achieving competitive empirical performance in unconditional image generation on several datasets, specifically **CIFAR10**, **MNIST**, **CELEB-A (64x64)**, and **LSUN Church (64x64)**. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 8) to gather more details about how these datasets were utilized. The authors explicitly state that they study the performance of their method on **CIFAR10**, **MNIST**, **CELEB-A**, and **LSUN Church**, confirming their involvement in the research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

1. **CIFAR10**: The citation is:
   > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

2. **MNIST**: The citation is:
   > Lecun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., and Haffner, P. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278â€“2324, 1998.

3. **CELEB-A**: The citation is:
   > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., and Tang, X. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. 2015.

4. **LSUN Church**: The citation is:
   > Yu, F., Seff, A., Zhang, Y., Song, S., Funkhouser, T., and Xiao, J. *LSUN: Construction of a large-scale image dataset using deep learning with humans in the loop*. 2016.

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets used in the research paper:

- **CIFAR10**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits, consisting of 70,000 images (60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing).
- **CELEB-A**: A large-scale face attributes dataset with more than 200,000 celebrity images, each annotated with 40 attribute labels.
- **LSUN Church**: A dataset containing images of churches, part of the LSUN dataset collection, which includes various scene categories.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
