To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Are Structural Concepts Universal in Transformer Language Models? Towards Interpretable Cross-Lingual Generalization" by Ningyu Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets or sources of data that are critical to their research. This section often outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include dataset information.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used for experiments. This section typically contains specifics about the data collection process, the types of data, and any preprocessing steps taken. The authors mention using data from **Universal Dependencies (UD) v2.10**, which is a key dataset for their analyses.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any additional insights or references to datasets that were particularly impactful in their findings. This may include performance metrics on specific datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. For example, the authors refer to the Universal Dependencies dataset, which I will need to cite properly.

The citation for the Universal Dependencies dataset is:
> de Marneffe, C., Manning, C. D., Nivre, J., & Zeman, D. (2021). Universal Dependencies. *Computational Linguistics*, 47(2), 255-308.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, along with their proper references.
