To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ViT-BEVSeg: A Hierarchical Transformer Network for Monocular Birds-Eye-View Segmentation" by Pramit Dutta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their approach on the **nuScenes dataset**, which is a clear indication that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. In this case, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation** section, particularly **section IV.B (Dataset Setup)**, where the authors provide a comprehensive description of the nuScenes dataset. They mention that the dataset consists of 1000 driving scenes, approximately 1.4 million images, and various annotations, which confirms its relevance and importance in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the nuScenes dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H Lang, et al. “nuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving”. In: Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2020, pp. 11621–11631.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the nuScenes dataset, I will ensure to document this dataset thoroughly, including its characteristics and the citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the dataset used in the research, ready for any further processing or review.
