To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Relational Autoencoder for Feature Extraction" by Qinxue Meng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that their proposed model is evaluated on a set of benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section V (Datasets)**, where the authors provide specific details about the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **MNIST**: This dataset is described as a well-known database of handwritten digits, containing a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 samples.

2. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 images labeled with 10 classes, with each class containing 6,000 images. The training set has 50,000 samples, while the test set has 10,000 samples.

In this section, the authors provide a brief overview of each dataset, which is crucial for understanding their relevance to the experiments conducted.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/kriz/cifar.html

Having gathered this information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
