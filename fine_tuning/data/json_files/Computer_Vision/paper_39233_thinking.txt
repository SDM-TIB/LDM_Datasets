To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BAE-NET: Branched Autoencoder for Shape Co-Segmentation" by Zhiqin Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that BAE-NET is evaluated on several datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to extract. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the significance of shape co-segmentation and mention that they demonstrate results on various datasets. This suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Network design choices and insights)** and **subsection 4.2 (Evaluation of unsupervised learning)**. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention:

1. **ShapeNet**: A comprehensive dataset for 3D models, which is a foundational dataset in the field of shape analysis.
2. **ShapeNet part dataset**: A subset of ShapeNet that includes part-level annotations for various categories of shapes.
3. **Tags2Parts**: A dataset used for weakly supervised part labeling, which contains shapes with associated tags indicating the presence of specific parts.

In **subsection 4.3**, the authors provide further details about the Tags2Parts dataset, confirming its relevance to their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **ShapeNet**, the citation is:
  > Angel X. Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, Leonidas Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qixing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Hao Su, Jianxiong Xiao, Li Yi, and Fisher Yu. *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

- For **ShapeNet part dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li Yi, Vladimir G. Kim, Duygu Ceylan, I Shen, Mengyan Yan, Hao Su, Cewu Lu, Qixing Huang, Alla Sheffer, Leonidas Guibas, et al. *A scalable active framework for region annotation in 3D shape collections*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 2016.

- For **Tags2Parts**, the citation is:
  > Sanjeev Muralikrishnan, Vladimir G. Kim, and Siddhartha Chaudhuri. *Tags2Parts: Discovering semantic regions from shape tags*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the requirements. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
