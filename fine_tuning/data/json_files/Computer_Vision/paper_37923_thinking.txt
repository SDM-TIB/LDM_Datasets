To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stellar Cluster Detection using GMM with Deep Variational Autoencoder" by Arnab Karmakar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the use of machine learning techniques for detecting stellar clusters, which suggests that datasets related to astronomical images might be involved.

Next, I will examine the **Data Collection** section, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. In this section, the authors mention two specific datasets:

1. **UKIDSS K-band Data**: This dataset is sourced from the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS) 10PLUS Galactic Plane Survey. It has a resolution of approximately 1 arcsec and a limiting magnitude of K = 18.1 mag.

2. **2MASS Data**: The authors refer to the Near Infrared (NIR) data from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), which includes both point source catalog data and images around specific cluster positions.

I will also check the **Data Format** subsection to understand how the data is structured and what specific properties are included in the datasets. This will help in providing a comprehensive description of each dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will look into the **References** section to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **UKIDSS K-band Data**, the citation is:
  > Dye, Simon, et al. "The UKIRT infrared deep sky survey early data release." *Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society* 372.3 (2006): 1227-1252.

- For the **2MASS Data**, the citation is:
  > Skrutskie, M. F., et al. "The two micron all sky survey (2MASS)." *The Astronomical Journal* 131.2 (2006): 1163.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly describes each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included for reference.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research and provide proper attribution to the original sources.
