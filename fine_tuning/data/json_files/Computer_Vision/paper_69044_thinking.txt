To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Hyperedge Interaction-aware Hypergraph Neural Network" by Xiaobing Pei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention five datasets:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset with 2,708 nodes, 1,579 edges, a maximum hyperedge size of 5, 1,433 features, and 7 classes.

2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network dataset with 3,312 nodes, 1,079 edges, a maximum hyperedge size of 26, 3,703 features, and 6 classes.

3. **Pubmed**: A citation network dataset with 19,717 nodes, 7,963 edges, a maximum hyperedge size of 171, 500 features, and 3 classes.

4. **ModelNet40**: A visual object dataset with 12,311 nodes, 12,311 edges, a maximum hyperedge size of 5, 100 features, and 67 classes.

5. **NTU2012**: Another visual object dataset with 2,012 nodes, 2,012 edges, a maximum hyperedge size of 5, 100 features, and 40 classes.

The authors also provide a table (Table 2) summarizing the statistics of these datasets, which confirms the details mentioned.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **Cora**, the citation is:
  > Srivastava, N., Hinton, G., Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., & Salakhutdinov, R. (2014). Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting. *J. Mach. Learn. Res.*, 15(1), 1929–1958.

- For **Citeseer**, the citation is:

- For **Pubmed**, the citation is:

- For **ModelNet40**, the citation is:

- For **NTU2012**, the citation is:

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
