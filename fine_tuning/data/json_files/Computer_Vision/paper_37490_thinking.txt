To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatially-sparse convolutional neural networks" by Benjamin Graham, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the **CASIA-OLHWDB1.1 dataset**, which is a strong indication that it is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. In this case, I will focus on **section 3 (Results)**, where the author discusses various datasets used for experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **Pendigits Dataset**: This dataset contains handwritten digits (0-9) with about 750 training characters for each of the ten classes.

2. **UJIpenchars Dataset**: This dataset includes 26 lowercase letters, with the training set containing 80 characters for each of the 26 classes.

3. **Online Handwritten Assamese Characters Dataset**: This dataset consists of 45 samples of 183 Indo-Aryan characters, with 36 samples used for training and 9 for testing.

4. **CASIA-OLHWDB1.1 Dataset**: This dataset contains online handwriting samples of 3755 Chinese characters, with approximately 240 training characters and 60 test characters per class.

5. **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, consisting of 28 × 28 pixel images.

6. **CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 Datasets**: These datasets each contain 50,000 32 × 32 color training images, split between 10 and 100 categories, respectively.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CASIA-OLHWDB1.1**, the citation is:
  > C.-L. Liu, F. Yin, D.-H. Wang, and Q.-F. Wang. *CASIA online and offline Chinese handwriting databases*. In Proc. 11th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), Beijing, China, pages 37–41, 2011.

- For **Pendigits**, the citation is:
  > K. Bache and M. Lichman. *UCI machine learning repository*, 2013.

- For **UJIpenchars**, the citation is:
  > K. Bache and M. Lichman. *UCI machine learning repository*, 2013.

- For **Online Handwritten Assamese Characters**, the citation is:
  > K. Bache and M. Lichman. *UCI machine learning repository*, 2013.

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

- For **CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E. Hinton. *Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks*. In NIPS, pages 1106–1114, 2012.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
