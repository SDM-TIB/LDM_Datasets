To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Descriptive Image Quality Assessment in the Wild" by Zhiyuan You et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces a new dataset called **DQ-495K**, which is a significant clue that there is a dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Task Paradigm and Dataset Construction)**, where the authors describe the construction of the DQ-495K dataset in detail. They mention that this dataset is designed for image quality assessment tasks and consists of 495,000 samples. This section will provide insights into the dataset's structure, purpose, and the types of tasks it supports.

In this section, the authors also reference other datasets used in their experiments, such as:

1. **BAPPS**: A dataset for perceptual image restoration.
2. **KADID-10K**: A large-scale artificially distorted IQA database.
3. **PIPAL**: A dataset for perceptual image quality assessment.

I will note down the details of these datasets, including their specific contributions to the research.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution. The citations I will look for include:

- For **DQ-495K**, since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper, I will use the paper itself as the citation:
  > Zhiyuan You, Jinjin Gu, Zheyuan Li, Xin Cai, Kaiwen Zhu, Chao Dong, Tianfan Xue. *Descriptive Image Quality Assessment in the Wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2312.08962, 2023.

- For **BAPPS**, I will find the original paper that introduced it:
  > J. Gu, H. Cai, H. Chen, X. Ye, J. Ren, and C. Dong. *PIPAL: A large-scale image quality assessment dataset for perceptual image restoration*. In ECCV, 2020.

- For **KADID-10K**, I will also find its original citation:
  > H. Lin, V. Hosu, and D. Saupe. *KADID-10k: A large-scale artificially distorted IQA database*. In International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX), 2019.

- For **PIPAL**, I will reference its original paper:
  > J. Gu, H. Cai, H. Chen, X. Ye, J. Ren, and C. Dong. *PIPAL: A large-scale image quality assessment dataset for perceptual image restoration*. In ECCV, 2020.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
