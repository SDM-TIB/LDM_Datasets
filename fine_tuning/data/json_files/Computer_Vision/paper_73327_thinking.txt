To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Discretize Denoising Diffusion ODEs" by Vinh Tong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on **5 datasets**, which indicates that there are multiple datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically provide details about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets they tested their method on. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets and their characteristics.

Upon reviewing the experiments section, I find that the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR10**: A well-known dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
2. **FFHQ**: The Flickr-Faces-HQ dataset, which consists of high-quality images of human faces.
3. **AFHQv2**: A dataset for animal face generation, containing images of various animals.
4. **LSUN-Bedroom**: A dataset containing images of bedrooms, used for scene generation tasks.
5. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset for image classification, containing millions of images across thousands of categories.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

The citations I find are as follows:

- **CIFAR10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- **FFHQ**:
  > Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. *A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 4401–4410, 2019.

- **AFHQv2**:
  > Yunjey Choi, Youngjung Uh, Jaejun Yoo, and Jung-Woo Ha. *Stargan v2: Diverse image synthesis for multiple domains*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 8188–8197, 2020.

- **LSUN-Bedroom**:
  > Fisher Yu, Ari Seff, Yinda Zhang, Shuran Song, Thomas Funkhouser, and Jianxiong Xiao. *LSUN: Construction of a large-scale image dataset using deep learning with humans in the loop*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.03365, 2015.

- **ImageNet**:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *Imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge*. International journal of computer vision, 115:211–252, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations for future use.
