To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MATLABER: Material-Aware Text-to-3D via LAtent BRDF auto-EncodeR" by Xudong Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize large-scale real-world BRDF collections, which suggests that specific datasets will be referenced.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention several large-scale BRDF material datasets, specifically **MERL BRDF**, **Adobe Substance3D materials**, and **TwoShotBRDF**. This is a strong indication that these datasets are crucial to their work.

In the **method section**, particularly in the subsection discussing the latent BRDF auto-encoder, the authors provide a detailed description of the **TwoShotBRDF dataset**. They mention that it contains 11,250 high-quality SVBRDF maps collected from various online sources, which is essential information for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if any additional datasets are mentioned or if there are any specific details about how these datasets were used in the experiments. However, the primary datasets have already been identified.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations I need to extract are:

1. **TwoShotBRDF**:
   > Boss, M., Jampani, V., Kim, K., Lensch, H., & Kautz, J. (2020). *Two-shot spatially-varying BRDF and shape estimation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 3982–3991.

2. **MERL BRDF**:
   > Matusik, W., Pfister, H., Brand, M., & McMillan, L. (2003). *A data-driven reflectance model*. ACM Transactions on Graphics, 22(3), 759–769.

3. **Adobe Substance3D materials**:
   > Adobe. *Substance3D*. Retrieved from https://substance3d.adobe.com/assets.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets relevant to the research presented in the paper.
