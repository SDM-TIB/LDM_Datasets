To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Affordable Indoor Navigation Solution via Line Color Identification Using Mono-Camera for Autonomous Vehicles" by Nizamuddin Maitlo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often discusses the context and previous work, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. This section typically details the experimental setup and may specify the datasets used for testing or validation. I will pay close attention to any figures, tables, or references that might indicate the presence of datasets.

In this paper, the authors discuss their proposed method, Affordable Indoor Navigation Solution (AINS), but they do not explicitly mention any datasets in the methodology or results sections. Therefore, I will check the **literature review** and **references** sections for any datasets that might have been utilized in previous studies cited by the authors.

Upon reviewing the references, I will identify any datasets that are commonly used in the field of indoor navigation for autonomous vehicles. For instance, if the authors reference well-known datasets like the "Indoor Positioning Dataset" or "Robot Operating System (ROS) datasets," I will note these down.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will ensure to retrieve the full citations for each dataset from the references section. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors referenced the "Indoor Positioning Dataset," I would look for the citation in the references section, which might look something like this:
> Morales, E. S., et al. "High precision indoor navigation for autonomous vehicles." 2019 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN). IEEE, 2019.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all relevant datasets from the research paper.
