To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative Modeling with Phase Stochastic Bridges" by Tianrong Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context of the research and may specify the datasets utilized.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. This is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for training and testing their models. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets, including their sizes, types, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets like **CIFAR-10**, **AFHQv2**, and **ImageNet-64**, as these are commonly used in generative modeling research. I will note down any details provided about these datasets, such as the number of images, categories, and any preprocessing steps mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the paper mentions the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, I will look for its citation, which typically includes the authors, title, conference or journal name, and year of publication. I will do the same for any other datasets mentioned.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset descriptions along with their full citations into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's details.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a comprehensive overview that includes all necessary citations.
