To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NeuroBind: Towards Unified Multimodal Representations for Neural Signals" by Fengyu Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses various neural signal modalities, which suggests that datasets related to these modalities might be included.

Next, I will examine **section 4.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. This section is crucial as it will likely contain the names, descriptions, and any specific details about the datasets.

In section 4.2, the authors mention four datasets:

1. **Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD)**: This dataset is described as a high-resolution fMRI dataset collected from eight human participants, consisting of responses to 70,566 distinct images. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Emily J Allen, Ghislain St-Yves, Yihan Wu, Jesse L Breedlove, Jacob S Prince, Logan T Dowdle, Matthias Nau, Brad Caron, Franco Pestilli, Ian Charest, et al. *A massive 7t fmri dataset to bridge cognitive neuroscience and artificial intelligence*. Nature neuroscience, 25(1):116â€“126, 2022.

2. **EEG ImageNet Dataset**: This dataset includes EEG recordings from six subjects viewing 2,000 images from 40 object categories, with a total of 12,000 EEG sequences. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Simone Palazzo, Concetto Spampinato, Isaak Kavasidis, Daniela Giordano, Joseph Schmidt, and Mubarak Shah. *Decoding brain representations by multimodal learning of neural activity and visual features*. 2020.

3. **V4 Widefield Calcium Imaging Dataset**: This dataset comprises recordings from three awake macaque monkeys in response to over 20,000 color natural images. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Tianye Wang, Haoxuan Yao, Tai Sing Lee, Jiayi Hong, Yang Li, Hongfei Jiang, Ian Max Andolina, and Shiming Tang. *A large calcium-imaging dataset reveals a systematic v4 organization for natural scenes*. 2023.

4. **V1 Spiking Dataset**: This dataset consists of electrophysiological recordings from the V1 of two awake rhesus macaques, capturing data from 166 isolated neurons. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Santiago A. Cadena, George H. Denfield, Edgar Y. Walker, Leon A. Gatys, Andreas Savas Toli, Matthias Bethge, and Alexander S. Ecker. *Deep convolutional models improve predictions of macaque v1 responses to natural images*. PLoS Computational Biology, 15, 2017.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the relevant details for each dataset, including their names, descriptions, and citations.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that can be used for further analysis or integration into a database, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its full citation.
