To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Disentangling Transfer in Continual Reinforcement Learning" by Maciej Wołczyk et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on continual reinforcement learning and mentions the use of the **Continual World benchmark**. This indicates that there may be datasets associated with this benchmark.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Background)**, where the authors describe the **Continual World** benchmark in detail. They mention that it consists of a set of realistic robotic tasks where a simulated Sawyer robot manipulates everyday objects. This section provides important context about the dataset's structure, including the observation and action spaces.

In **section 3.3**, the authors elaborate on the **Continual World** benchmark, stating that it includes sequences of tasks (CW10 and CW20) and describes the nature of the tasks and the data used. This section confirms that the **Continual World** benchmark is indeed a dataset used for their experiments.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see how the datasets are utilized in the context of their experiments. The authors mention using the **CW10** and **CW20** sequences for evaluation, which reinforces the importance of these datasets in their study.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The **Continual World benchmark** is cited as follows:
- For the **Continual World benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Maciej Wołczyk, Michał Zajac, Razvan Pascanu, Łukasz Kuciński, and Piotr Miłos. *Continual World: A Robotic Benchmark for Continual Reinforcement Learning*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 34, 2021.

After compiling this information, I will prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
