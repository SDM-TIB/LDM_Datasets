To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PromptFix: You Prompt and We Fix the Photo" by Yongsheng Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a **large-scale instruction-following dataset** for various image-processing tasks, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data Curation)**, where the authors detail their dataset collection process. Here, they mention several datasets used for different tasks:

1. **Object Removal and Creation Dataset**: This dataset consists of 300,000 image pairs based on the GQA dataset. The authors describe how they segment objects and generate instructions for object removal and creation.

2. **Image Dehazing Dataset**: This dataset combines synthetic datasets (RESIDE, SRRS) and real-world datasets (Dense-Haze, O-Haze), totaling 102,230 synthetic image pairs and 100 real-world pairs.

3. **Colorization Dataset**: A subset of Laion-5b containing 46,465 images is used to generate grayscale images for colorization tasks.

4. **Super Resolution Dataset**: This dataset is compiled from subsets of Laion-5b, Flickr30K, HQ-50K, Flickr1M, and Pexels100K, resulting in 288,015 image pairs.

5. **Low Light Enhancement Dataset**: This dataset combines LOL, SID, SMID, and SDSD datasets, containing 47,139 pairs of images.

6. **Snow Removal Dataset**: This dataset is created from SRRS, CSD, RVSD, and Snow100K, totaling 60,879 pairs of images.

7. **Watermark Removal Dataset**: This dataset combines CLWD and LOGO30K, containing 124,805 pairs of images.

After identifying these datasets, I will then look into the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. Here are the citations I will include:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries and their citations into a structured format for further processing.
