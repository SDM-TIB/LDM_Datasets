To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Elliptic Kernel Unsupervised Autoencoder-Graph Convolutional Network Ensemble Model for Hyperspectral Unmixing" by Estefanía Alfaro-Mejía et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed model is assessed with benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section V (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the benchmark datasets used in their study. Here, they describe three datasets:

1. **Samson Dataset**: This dataset consists of 156 bands with wavelengths ranging from 401 to 889 nm. The authors focus on a specific region of interest (ROI) called Samson #1, which has a spatial resolution of 95 × 95 pixels and includes three endmembers: Soil, Tree, and Water.

2. **Jasper Ridge Dataset**: This dataset comprises 224 bands with a spectral resolution of 9.46 nm, recorded between 380 and 2500 nm. After noise correction, 194 bands are selected, and the region of interest spans 100 × 100 pixels, including four endmembers: Road, Soil, Water, and Tree.

3. **Urban Dataset**: This dataset consists of 210 bands, with 162 bands remaining after removing channels affected by atmospheric effects. The spectral resolution is 307 × 307 pixels, and it includes five endmembers: Grass, Asphalt, Roof, Tree, and Soil.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets, but it does mention that they are available at a specific URL.

The citation for the datasets can be summarized as follows:

- **Samson Dataset**: Available at: https://rslab.ut.ac.ir/data (accessed on 25 November 2023).
- **Jasper Ridge Dataset**: Available at: https://rslab.ut.ac.ir/data (accessed on 25 November 2023).
- **Urban Dataset**: Available at: https://rslab.ut.ac.ir/data (accessed on 25 November 2023).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and citations in a structured format for further processing.
