To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SEG&STRUCT: The Interplay Between Part Segmentation and Structure Inference for 3D Shape Parsing" by Jeonghyun Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention that their experimental results are based on **StructureNet and PartNet**, indicating that these are the datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experimental results section**. The authors state that they prepared two kinds of datasets to test their method: **PartNet** and **StructureNet**. They describe PartNet as providing point cloud data sampled on surfaces of 3D mesh from **ShapeNet** and its corresponding semantic-instance part annotation. This gives me a clear understanding of what PartNet entails.

For StructureNet, the authors explain that it is built upon PartNet with additional annotations on the structure hierarchy, part bounding boxes, and part relations. This indicates that StructureNet is a more specialized dataset derived from PartNet.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets in detail.

1. For **PartNet**, the citation is:
   > Kaichun Mo, Shilin Zhu, Angel X Chang, Li Yi, Subarna Tripathi, Leonidas J Guibas, and Hao Su. *PartNet: A large-scale benchmark for fine-grained and hierarchical part-level 3D object understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019.

2. For **StructureNet**, the citation is:
   > Kaichun Mo, Paul Guerrero, Li Yi, Hao Su, Peter Wonka, Niloy J. Mitra, and Leonidas J. Guibas. *StructureNet: Hierarchical graph networks for 3D shape generation*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both datasets as they are crucial for proper attribution and further research.

In summary, I will document the following datasets:
- **PartNet**: A dataset providing point cloud data and semantic-instance part annotations.
- **StructureNet**: A dataset built upon PartNet with additional annotations for structure hierarchy and part relationships.

I will ensure that the full citations are included for both datasets in the final output.
