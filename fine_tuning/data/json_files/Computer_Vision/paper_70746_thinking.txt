To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fed3DGS: Scalable 3D Gaussian Splatting with Federated Learning" by Teppei Suzuki, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the method is validated on several large-scale benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the author explicitly lists the datasets used for evaluation. Here, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Mill 19**: This dataset is referenced as one of the scenes used for evaluation. It is important to note the specific context in which it is used.

2. **UrbanScene3D**: This dataset is also mentioned as part of the evaluation, specifically for scenes like Residence, Sci-Art, and Campus.

3. **Quad 6k**: This dataset is highlighted as another benchmark used in the experiments.

4. **4Seasons**: This dataset is used to evaluate the framework's ability to reflect changes in scenes across different seasons.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **Mill 19**:
  > Turki, H., Ramanan, D., Satyanarayanan, M. *Mega-nerf: Scalable construction of large-scale nerfs for virtual fly-throughs*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 12922–12931, 2022.

- For **UrbanScene3D**:
  > Liu, Y., Xue, F., Huang, H. *Urbanscene3d: A large scale urban scene dataset and simulator*. 2021.

- For **Quad 6k**:
  > Turki, H., Zhang, J.Y., Ferroni, F., Ramanan, D. *Suds: Scalable urban dynamic scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 12375–12385, 2023.

- For **4Seasons**:
  > Wenzel, P., Wang, R., Yang, N., Cheng, Q., Khan, Q., von Stumberg, L., Zeller, N., Cremers, D. *4Seasons: A cross-season dataset for multi-weather SLAM in autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the German Conference on Pattern Recognition, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
