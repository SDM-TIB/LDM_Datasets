To extract datasets from the research paper titled "INVGC: Robust Cross-Modal Retrieval by Inverse Graph Convolution" by Xiangru Jian and Yimu Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the representation degeneration problem and its impact on cross-modal retrieval, mentioning various benchmarks. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets that are referenced.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly section 4.2, where the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention several datasets:

1. **MSCOCO**: A widely used dataset for image captioning and object detection, consisting of 123,000 images, each with five captions. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge J. Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Computer Vision - ECCV 2014 - 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V, volume 8693 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pages 740–755. Springer.

2. **Flickr30k**: This dataset contains 31,000 images collected from Flickr, each accompanied by five reference sentences. The citation is:
   > Bryan A. Plummer, Liwei Wang, Chris M. Cervantes, Juan C. Caicedo, Julia Hockenmaier, and Svetlana Lazebnik. *Flickr30k Entities: Collecting Region-to-Phrase Correspondences for Richer Image-to-Sentence Models*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 123(1):74–93, 2017.

3. **MSR-VTT**: A large video description dataset containing approximately 10,000 videos, each with 20 captions. The citation is:
   > Jun Xu, Tao Mei, Ting Yao, and Yong Rui. *MSR-VTT: A Large Video Description Dataset for Bridging Video and Language*. In 2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, CVPR 2016, Las Vegas, NV, USA, June 27-30, 2016, pages 5288–5296. IEEE Computer Society.

4. **MSVD**: This dataset consists of 1,970 videos and about 80,000 captions. The citation is:
   > David Chen and William Dolan. *Collecting Highly Parallel Data for Paraphrase Evaluation*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 190–200, Portland, Oregon, USA. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2011.

5. **ActivityNet**: Contains 20,000 videos and approximately 100,000 descriptive sentences. The citation is:
   > Fabian Caba Heilbron, Victor Escorcia, and Juan Carlos Niebles. *ActivityNet: A Large-Scale Video Benchmark for Human Activity Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 961–970, 2015.

6. **CLOTHO**: This dataset consists of audio samples with event descriptions. The citation is:
   > Andreea-Maria Oncescu, A. Sophia Koepke, João F. Henriques, Zeynep Akata, and Samuel Albanie. *Audio Retrieval with Natural Language Queries: A Benchmark Study*. IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, pages 1–1, 2022.

7. **AudioCaps**: Comprises sound samples with event descriptions. The citation is:
   > Chris Dongjoo Kim, Byeongchang Kim, Hyunmin Lee, and Gunhee Kim. *AudioCaps: Generating Captions for Audios in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pages 119–132, Minneapolis, Minnesota. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2019.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile their details and citations accurately for further processing or documentation. This structured approach will help in maintaining clarity and thoroughness in the extraction process.
