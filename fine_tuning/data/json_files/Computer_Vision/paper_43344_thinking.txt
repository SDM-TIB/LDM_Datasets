To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Autoencoders for Strategic Decision Support" by Sam Verboven et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental validation sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "two large industry-provided human resources datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors describe the datasets as "proprietary datasets obtained from a European HR services provider." This suggests that the datasets are specific to the context of the study and are not publicly available.

In the **methodology section**, the authors provide more details about the datasets:
1. **Dataset D1**: This dataset consists of 128,820 observations of employees and includes five dimensions.
2. **Dataset D2**: This dataset consists of 1,864 observations of employers and includes eleven dimensions.

The paper emphasizes that these datasets are crucial for evaluating the proposed autoencoder approach in the context of strategic decision-making.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets. However, since these datasets are proprietary and not publicly available, there may not be formal citations like those for publicly accessible datasets. Instead, I will note that the datasets are proprietary and provide a brief description of their origin.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper itself and clearly describe each dataset.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Sam Verboven, Jeroen Berrevoets, Chris Wuytens, Bart Baesens, Wouter Verbeke. *Autoencoders for Strategic Decision Support*. Preprint, May 5, 2020.

The datasets will be described as follows:
1. **Dataset D1**: Proprietary dataset from a European HR services provider, consisting of 128,820 observations of employees with five dimensions.
2. **Dataset D2**: Proprietary dataset from a European HR services provider, consisting of 1,864 observations of employers with eleven dimensions.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare to format it according to the required structure for downstream processing.
