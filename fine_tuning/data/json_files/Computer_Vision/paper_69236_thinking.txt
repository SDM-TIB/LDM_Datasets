To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extreme Two-View Geometry From Object Poses with Diffusion Models" by Yujing Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the method is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of dataset names.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) closely, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **GSO Dataset**: This dataset is described as a synthetic object dataset containing about 1,000 3D-scanned household objects. The authors selected 23 objects and rendered 21 images for each object for evaluation.

2. **Navi Dataset**: This is a real object dataset that contains images of the same object captured in different environments and viewpoints, with accurate calibrations for both intrinsic and extrinsic matrices. The dataset includes 36 objects, of which 27 were selected for evaluation.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For the **GSO Dataset**:
  > Downs, L., Francis, A., Koenig, N., Kinman, B., Hickman, R., Reymann, K., McHugh, T. B., & Vanhoucke, V. (2022). Google scanned objects: A high-quality dataset of 3D scanned household items. In *2022 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)* (pp. 2553â€“2560).

- For the **Navi Dataset**:
  > Jampani, V., Maninis, K.-K., Engelhardt, A., Karpur, A., Truong, K., Sargent, K., Popov, S., Araujo, A., Martin-Brualla, R., Patel, K., Vlasic, D., Ferrari, V., Liu, C., Li, Y., & Zhou, H. (2023). NAVI: Category-agnostic image collections with high-quality 3D shape and pose annotations. In *NeurIPS*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
