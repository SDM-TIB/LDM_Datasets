To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CarSpeedNet: A Deep Neural Network-based Car Speed Estimation from Smartphone Accelerometer" by Barak Or, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study utilizes **13 hours of data collected from smartphones mounted in cars navigating through various regions in Israel**. This suggests that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more specific details.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the author discusses the importance of accurate car speed estimation and the use of smartphone accelerometers. While this section provides context, it does not explicitly name any datasets.

I will then focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsection titled **Data Acquisition and Dataset Creation**. Here, the author describes the dataset in detail, stating that it was assembled using a Samsung Galaxy Smartphone, capturing accelerometer data at a frequency of 500 Hz and GPS data at 1 Hz. The dataset consists of **13.2 hours of vehicular operation** across **51 distinct driving sessions**, with one session reserved for testing and the rest for training.

The author emphasizes the importance of precise ground truth labels derived from GPS data, which were used to label the accelerometer data. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset's characteristics, including the geographical diversity of the data collection in Israel and the conditions under which the data was gathered.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is created by the author using their own data collection methods, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset:

- For the dataset, the citation is:
  > Barak Or. *CarSpeedNet: A Deep Neural Network-based Car Speed Estimation from Smartphone Accelerometer*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC), 2024.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation as required. The dataset entry will include details such as the type of data collected (accelerometer and GPS), the duration of the dataset, the number of driving sessions, and the geographical context.

After gathering all this information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset details along with the citation for future reference.
