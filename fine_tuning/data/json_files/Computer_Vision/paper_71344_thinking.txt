To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CoherentGS: Sparse Novel View Synthesis with Coherent 3D Gaussians" by Avinash Paliwal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions improvements in 3D reconstruction from sparse images, which suggests that datasets may be involved, particularly in the context of evaluating the proposed method.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention two datasets: **LLFF** and **NVS-RGBD**. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics, the number of views, and any relevant metrics used for evaluation.

In the **LLFF dataset** subsection, the authors provide quantitative comparisons, indicating that they used this dataset with varying numbers of input views (2 to 4). They also mention that their method produces better results across several metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) compared to other methods.

In the **NVS-RGBD dataset** subsection, the authors again provide numerical comparisons and highlight the performance of their method against other approaches. They specify that this dataset is used with 2 and 3 input images, which is crucial information for understanding the context of their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

1. For the **LLFF dataset**, the citation is:
   > Mildenhall, B., Srinivasan, P.P., Tancik, M., Barron, J.T., Ramamoorthi, R., & Ng, R. (2020). *Nerf: Representing scenes as neural radiance fields for view synthesis*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

2. For the **NVS-RGBD dataset**, the citation is:
   > Wang, G., Chen, Z., & Loy, C.C. (2023). *SparseNeRF: Distilling depth ranking for few-shot novel view synthesis*. In IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **LLFF Dataset**: A dataset used for evaluating novel view synthesis methods, containing images with varying input views.
- **NVS-RGBD Dataset**: A dataset designed for sparse input scenarios, used to assess the performance of the proposed method against other state-of-the-art techniques.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
