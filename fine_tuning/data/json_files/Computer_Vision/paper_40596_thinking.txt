To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LoRAS: An oversampling approach for imbalanced datasets" by Saptarshi Bej et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions benchmarking the LoRAS algorithm with **14 publicly available imbalanced datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are used.

Next, I will focus on the **section 3.1 (Datasets used for validation)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Scikit-learn imbalanced benchmark datasets**: This collection includes 27 pre-processed datasets that span various fields. The authors specifically selected 11 datasets based on criteria of high imbalance and high dimensionality.

2. **Credit card fraud detection dataset**: This dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013, with a significant imbalance ratio.

3. **Small datasets (ar1 and ar3)**: These datasets have very few data points, specifically less than 10 points in the minority class.

The paper also provides a table (Table 2) summarizing the statistics for the datasets, including their imbalance ratios, number of samples, and number of features.

Now, I will extract the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **Scikit-learn imbalanced benchmark datasets**, the citation is:
  > Guillaume Lemaˆıtre, Fernando Nogueira, and Christos K. Aridas. *Imbalanced-learn: A Python Toolbox to Tackle the Curse of Imbalanced Datasets in Machine Learning*. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 18:559–563, Jan, 2017.

- For the **Credit card fraud detection dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andrea Dal Pozzolo, Giacomo Boracchi, Olivier Caelen, Cesare Alippi, and Gianluca Bontempi. *Credit card fraud detection: A realistic modeling and a novel learning strategy*. IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 29:1–14, 09 2017.

- For the **ar1 and ar3 datasets**, the citations are not explicitly provided in the text, but they are mentioned as small datasets used for testing.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that all relevant datasets are accurately documented and cited.
