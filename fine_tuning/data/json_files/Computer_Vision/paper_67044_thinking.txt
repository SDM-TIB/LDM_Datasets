To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast ODE-based Sampling for Diffusion Models in Around 5 Steps" by Zhenyu Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method on various datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention using several datasets for their experiments, including CIFAR10, FFHQ, ImageNet, and LSUN Bedroom. I will note down these datasets and any relevant details provided about them.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide specific details about the datasets used, including their resolutions and the context in which they were applied. For example, they mention CIFAR10 with a resolution of 32x32, FFHQ with 64x64, ImageNet with 64x64, and LSUN Bedroom with 256x256. I will ensure to capture these details as they are crucial for understanding the context of the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The citations typically include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, I will look for the following datasets and their citations:
1. **CIFAR10**: 
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical Report, 2009.

2. **FFHQ**: 
   > Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. *A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 4401–4410, 2019.

3. **ImageNet**: 
   > Olga Russakovsky et al. *Imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211–252, 2015.

4. **LSUN Bedroom**: 
   > Fisher Yu et al. *LSUN: Construction of a large-scale image dataset using deep learning with humans in the loop*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.03365, 2015.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured and properly attributed.
