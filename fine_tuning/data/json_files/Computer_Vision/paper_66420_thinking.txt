To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reti-Diff: Illumination Degradation Image Restoration with Retinex-based Latent Diffusion Model" by Chunming He et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or comparison.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference datasets that are commonly used in the field. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any subsections that detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. This section typically contains the most comprehensive information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics relevant to the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

From the paper, I have identified the following datasets:

1. **LOL-v1 Dataset**: This dataset is used for low-light image enhancement tasks. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Guo, X., Li, Y., Ling, H. (2016). "LIME: Low-light image enhancement via illumination map estimation." IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 26(2), 982-993.

2. **LOL-v2-real Dataset**: This dataset is also used for low-light image enhancement and is a real-world version of the LOL dataset. The citation is:
   > Guo, X., Li, Y., Ling, H. (2016). "LIME: Low-light image enhancement via illumination map estimation." IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 26(2), 982-993.

3. **LOL-v2-syn Dataset**: This is a synthetic version of the LOL dataset used for training and evaluation. The citation is:
   > Guo, X., Li, Y., Ling, H. (2016). "LIME: Low-light image enhancement via illumination map estimation." IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 26(2), 982-993.

4. **SID Dataset**: This dataset is used for image enhancement tasks, particularly in low-light conditions. The citation is:
   > Chen, C., Chen, Q., Do, M.N., Koltun, V. (2019). "Seeing motion in the dark." In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 3185-3194.

5. **UIEB Dataset**: This dataset is used for underwater image enhancement tasks. The citation is:
   > Li, C., Guo, C., Ren, W., Cong, R., Hou, J., Kwong, S., Tao, D. (2019). "An underwater image enhancement benchmark dataset and beyond." IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 29, 4376-4389.

6. **LSUI Dataset**: This dataset is also used for underwater image enhancement. The citation is:
   > Li, C., Guo, C., Ren, W., Cong, R., Hou, J., Kwong, S., Tao, D. (2019). "An underwater image enhancement benchmark dataset and beyond." IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 29, 4376-4389.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
