To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EGIC: Enhanced Low-Bit-Rate Generative Image Compression Guided by Semantic Segmentation" by Nikolai Körber et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, I will look for specific names, descriptions, and any relevant details about the datasets, such as the number of images, classes, and any particular characteristics that are highlighted.

From the paper, I identify the following datasets:

1. **Coco2017 Panoptic Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as containing 118,287 training images and 133 semantic classes. It is used for training the model.

2. **DIV2K Dataset**: This high-resolution image dataset contains 100 images and is used for evaluating the model's performance.

3. **CLIC 2020 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 428 images and is also used for evaluation purposes.

4. **Kodak Dataset**: A widely used benchmark dataset for image compression, containing 24 images.

5. **Cityscapes Dataset**: A down-sized version of this dataset is mentioned, which contains 2,975 training images and 500 validation images, used for preliminary studies.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I find are:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for further processing or review.
