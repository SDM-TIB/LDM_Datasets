To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Anomaly Detection for Time-series Data" by Min Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method using the **Yahoo benchmark datasets** and three tunneling engineering simulation experiments. This suggests that there are specific datasets that I need to locate.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the **Yahoo Webscope anomaly detection benchmark**, which consists of a real dataset (A1 Benchmark) and three synthetic datasets (A2 Benchmark, A3 Benchmark, and A4 Benchmark). This is a clear indication that I need to extract details about these datasets.

In the **datasets section**, the authors provide a summary of the Yahoo benchmark datasets:
1. **A1 Benchmark**: Contains 67 datasets (TS1-TS67) with sizes ranging from 741 to 1461 observations.
2. **A2 Benchmark**: Contains 100 datasets (TS1-TS100) with 1421 observations each.
3. **A3 Benchmark**: Contains 100 datasets (TS1-TS100) with 1680 observations each.
4. **A4 Benchmark**: Contains 100 datasets (TS1-TS100) with 1680 observations each.

Additionally, the paper describes three engineering datasets used for tunneling projects:
1. **River Tunnel Dataset**: Collected from the C Shanghai Tunnel project, focusing on excavation chamber pressure data.
2. **Subway Tunnel Dataset**: Collected from the Y Shanghai subway tunnel project, monitoring excavation chamber pressure data.
3. **Road Tunnel Dataset**: Contains pressure data from the Wuhan S Road Tunnel project, monitored by five slurry chamber pressure sensors.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper. The Yahoo benchmark datasets are cited as follows:
- Yahoo Webscope anomaly detection benchmark: 
  > Yahoo Labs. Webscope | Yahoo Labs: S5 - A Labeled Anomaly Detection Dataset. Available: https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=s

For the engineering datasets, while specific citations may not be provided in the references, I will note that they are derived from real-world projects and mention that they are not publicly available due to restrictions.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for the Yahoo benchmark datasets and a description for the engineering datasets, noting their context and significance.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
