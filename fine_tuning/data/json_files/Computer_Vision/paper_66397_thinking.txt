To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models" by Jiaming Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on **8 image datasets**, which indicates that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed list of the datasets used in their study. They mention the following datasets:

1. **Pets Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of their method. It is commonly used for image classification tasks involving pet breeds.

2. **Flowers Dataset**: Another dataset mentioned, which is typically used for classifying various types of flowers.

3. **ImageNet**: A well-known large-scale dataset used for image classification, containing millions of labeled images across thousands of categories.

4. **Food101 Dataset**: This dataset consists of images of food items, used for classification tasks related to food recognition.

5. **SUN397 Dataset**: A dataset that includes images of various scenes, used for scene recognition tasks.

6. **DTD (Describable Textures Dataset)**: This dataset is used for texture recognition tasks.

7. **EuroSAT Dataset**: A dataset for land use and land cover classification, containing satellite images.

8. **UCF101 Dataset**: A dataset for action recognition in videos, containing various human actions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the experiments.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
