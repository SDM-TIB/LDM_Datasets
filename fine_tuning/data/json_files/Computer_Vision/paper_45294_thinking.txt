To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Graph Neural Network Framework for Causal Inference in Brain Networks" by S. Wein et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a graph neural network framework and refers to datasets related to functional and structural brain imaging, which suggests that there are specific datasets that I need to identify.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly **section 4.3 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their study. Here, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about how they were used in the research.

In this paper, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Human Connectome Project (HCP) Dataset**: This dataset includes resting-state fMRI data from 100 subjects, with each session lasting 14.4 minutes. The authors describe the acquisition parameters and preprocessing steps taken for this dataset.

2. **University of Regensburg (UR) Dataset**: This dataset consists of resting-state fMRI data from 10 subjects, collected over 7.3 minutes per session. The authors provide details about the acquisition and preprocessing similar to the HCP dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For the **Human Connectome Project (HCP) Dataset**:
  > Van Essen, D. C., Smith, S. M., Barch, D. M., Behrens, T. E. J., Yacoub, E., & Ugurbil, K. (2013). The WU-Minn Human Connectome Project: An Overview. *NeuroImage*, 80, 144-168.

- For the **University of Regensburg (UR) Dataset**:
  > This dataset is not associated with a specific publication but is described in the methods section of the paper. Therefore, I will note that it is a local dataset collected at the University of Regensburg.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
