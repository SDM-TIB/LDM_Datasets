To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Treatment Outcome Prediction for Intracerebral Hemorrhage via Generative Prognostic Model with Imaging and Tabular Data" by Wenao Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the model is trained on observational data collected from non-randomized controlled trials, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiment)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention utilizing an in-house dataset of intracerebral hemorrhage cases obtained from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority. The details provided include:

1. **Dataset Description**: The dataset comprises 504 cases diagnosed with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) who underwent head CT scans. It includes both imaging data (CT scans) and non-imaging clinical data with 17 clinical characteristics.

2. **Data Characteristics**: The authors specify that among the 504 cases, 364 received conservative treatment, and 140 underwent surgery. They also mention the systematic imbalance in the dataset due to the selection of specific cases for testing.

3. **Outcome Measurement**: The treatment outcome was assessed using the 1-year modified Rankin Scale (mRS), which is crucial for understanding the dataset's application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since this dataset is an in-house dataset and not publicly available, it may not have a formal citation like other datasets. Instead, I will note that it is an in-house dataset from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: In-house dataset of intracerebral hemorrhage cases
- **Description**: A dataset comprising 504 cases diagnosed with ICH, including both imaging (CT scans) and non-imaging clinical data with 17 characteristics.
- **Citation**: Not applicable (in-house dataset from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority).

After gathering this information, I will compile it into a structured format for further processing or review.
