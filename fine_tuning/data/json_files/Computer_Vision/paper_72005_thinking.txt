To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Emergent Language Symbolic Autoencoder (ELSA) with Weak Supervision to Model Hierarchical Brain Networks" by Ammar Ahmed Pallikonda Latheef et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, but the dataset section will contain the most detailed information.

In **section 2 (Dataset)**, the authors describe the dataset used for their analysis. They mention the **Beijing cohort dataset** from the **1000 Functional Connectomes Project**. This dataset consists of resting-state fMRI data from 198 young adults, detailing the demographics and the specifics of the data collection process.

Next, I will ensure that I gather the full citation for the dataset. In the **References section**, I will look for the citation related to the **1000 Functional Connectomes Project**. The relevant citation is:

> Kalcher, K., Huf, W., Boubela, R.N., Filzmoser, P., Pezawas, L., Biswal, B., Kasper, S., Moser, E., Windischberger, C. "Fully exploratory network independent component analysis of the 1000 functional connectomes database." *Frontiers in Human Neuroscience*, 6, 301 (2012).

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Beijing Cohort Dataset**: This dataset includes resting-state fMRI data from 198 young adults (76 males and 122 females), aged between 18 and 26 years. The fMRI data consists of 33 slices captured over 225 timepoints, and after processing, a refined dataset of 176 subjects was used for analysis.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset and its citation, ensuring that all details are accurately captured for future reference or processing.
