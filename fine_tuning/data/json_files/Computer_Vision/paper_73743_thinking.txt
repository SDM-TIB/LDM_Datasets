To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explainable Deep Learning Analysis for Raga Identification in Indian Art Music" by Parampreet Singh and Vipul Arora, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors introduce a novel dataset called "Prasarbharti Indian Music" version-1 (PIM-v1), which is a significant dataset for Hindustani Classical Music (HCM) recordings. This is a clear indication that I need to gather more details about this dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the part where the dataset is described. The authors mention that the PIM-v1 dataset comprises 501 HCM songs, totaling approximately 191.70 hours of music, and includes 144 unique Ragas performed by 169 vocal artists. This section provides essential details about the dataset's content, structure, and significance.

In addition to PIM-v1, I will also look for other datasets mentioned in the **related work section**. The authors reference the **Indian Art Music Raga Recognition Dataset (RRD)** and the **Saraga dataset**. I will extract details about these datasets as well, including their sizes and features.

For the **Indian Art Music Raga Recognition Dataset (RRD)**, the authors state it offers 116 hours of HCM with 300 recordings featuring 30 unique ragas. This dataset requires access requests for audio file viewing.

For the **Saraga dataset**, it comprises 108 recordings of HCM in 61 unique Ragas and 9 unique talas, totaling 43.6 hours. The authors note that Saraga allows download access with annotations.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for each dataset:

1. For the **Prasarbharti Indian Music version-1 (PIM-v1)** dataset, the citation is:
   > Parampreet Singh and Vipul Arora. *Explainable Deep Learning Analysis for Raga Identification in Indian Art Music*. Journal of LaTeX Class Files, vol. ..., no. ..., .... ....

2. For the **Indian Art Music Raga Recognition Dataset (RRD)**, the citation is:
   > S. Gulati, J. Serrà, K. K. Ganguli, S. Sentürk, and X. Serra. *Indian Art Music Raga Recognition Dataset (features)*. Nov. 2022.

3. For the **Saraga dataset**, the citation is:
   > A. Srinivasamurthy, S. Gulati, R. Caro Repetto, and X. Serra. *Saraga: Open datasets for research on Indian art music*. Empirical Musicology Review, vol. 16, no. 1, p. 85–98, Dec. 2021.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
