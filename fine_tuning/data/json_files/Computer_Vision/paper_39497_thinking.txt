To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generated Loss, Augmented Training, and Multiscale VAE" by Jason Chou and Gautam Hathi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention their interest in generating realistic test data, specifically referencing the **OpenAddresses Vermont state dataset** as a benchmark for their framework. This indicates that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors describe the **OpenAddresses Vermont state dataset** in detail, including its structure and how it was used in their experiments. They mention that the dataset contains a corpus of Vermont state addresses, which is essential for their model training.

Now, I will check the **appendices** for any additional datasets or details about the datasets used. The paper includes a description of how the dataset was split into training, testing, and validation sets, which is important for understanding the dataset's application in their research.

After identifying the dataset, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the **OpenAddresses Vermont state dataset**. The citation is typically formatted in a specific style, and I will ensure to capture all necessary details such as authors, title, source, and publication year.

The full citation for the **OpenAddresses Vermont state dataset** is:
> OpenAddresses. *OpenAddresses Vermont state data set*. Retrieved from https://github.com/EIFY/vermont_address.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive record of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for any further processing or review.
