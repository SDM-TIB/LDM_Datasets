To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MeshDiffusion: Score-Based Generative 3D Mesh Modeling" by Yao Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses generating realistic 3D shapes and mentions the use of a specific dataset, which indicates that there may be more details in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, the authors mention that they fit tetrahedral grids on five ShapeNet subcategories: **Chair, Airplane, Car, Rifle, and Table**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the ShapeNet dataset. The authors reference the ShapeNet dataset as follows:

- **ShapeNet Dataset**: 
  > Angel X Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, Leonidas Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qixing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Hao Su, et al. *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

Since the authors used specific subcategories from ShapeNet, I will note that while they do not provide separate citations for each subcategory, the main ShapeNet citation suffices for referencing the dataset used in their experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation for the ShapeNet dataset as it is the primary dataset referenced in the paper.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness in the citations.
