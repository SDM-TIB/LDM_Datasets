To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FC2RN: A Fully Convolutional Corner Refinement Network for Accurate Multi-Oriented Scene Text Detection" by Xugong Qin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors indicate that their method is evaluated on **four public datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **MSRA-TD500**: A multilingual dataset with 300 training images and 200 testing images, focusing on oriented text lines.
2. **ICDAR2017-RCTW**: This dataset contains 8034 training images and 4229 test images, featuring scene texts in both Chinese and English.
3. **ICDAR2015**: A dataset specifically for English text detection, comprising 1000 training images and 500 testing images.
4. **COCO-Text**: A large dataset with 63,686 images, divided into training, validation, and testing sets.

I will then verify the details of these datasets in the **experiments section** to ensure they are accurately described and confirm their relevance to the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MSRA-TD500**, the citation is:

- For **ICDAR2017-RCTW**, the citation is:

- For **ICDAR2015**, the citation is:

- For **COCO-Text**, the citation is:

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for further processing or review.
