To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Iterative Few-shot Semantic Segmentation from Image Label Text" by Haohan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on **PASCAL-5i** and **COCO-20i datasets**, indicating that these are the primary datasets used in their research.

Next, I will delve into the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors explicitly state that they evaluated their framework on the **PASCAL-5i** and **COCO-20i datasets**. They describe the evaluation process and the metrics used, which confirms that these datasets are integral to their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **PASCAL-5i Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Shaban, A., Bansal, S., Liu, Z., Essa, I., & Boots, B. (2017). One-shot learning for semantic segmentation. In *BMVC*.

2. **COCO-20i Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollar, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context. In *ECCV*.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- **PASCAL-5i** with the citation provided.
- **COCO-20i** with the citation provided.

This thorough approach ensures that I have accurately captured the relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
