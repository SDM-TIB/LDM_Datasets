To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scale-covariant and scale-invariant Gaussian derivative networks" by Tony Lindeberg, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **MNIST Large Scale dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is significant to the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. In this paper, the **experiments** section is likely to provide insights into the datasets used for training and testing the models. I will pay particular attention to any sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as **Section 5 (Experiments)** and **Section 6 (Experiments with a multi-scale-channel network)**.

In **Section 5**, the author states that they conducted experiments on the **MNIST dataset**, which is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition. They also mention the **MNIST Large Scale dataset**, which contains rescaled images from the original MNIST dataset. This dataset is crucial for evaluating the proposed methodology.

In **Section 6**, the author elaborates on the **MNIST Large Scale dataset**, indicating that it contains rescaled digits embedded in images of size 112 × 112. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations I need to extract are:

1. For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

2. For the **MNIST Large Scale dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ylva Jansson and Tony Lindeberg. *MNIST Large Scale dataset*. Zenodo, 2020. Available at: https://www.zenodo.org/record/3820247.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as they are critical for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent work or analysis. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research paper.
