To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Autocomplete Systems as a Communication Game" by Mina Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and experiments sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of collecting a supervised dataset of keywords-sentence pairs and mention the need for a dataset that captures real user interactions. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 3) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. The authors state that they trained their autocomplete system on **500K randomly sampled sentences from Yelp reviews**. This indicates that the Yelp dataset is a key dataset used in their experiments.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will refer to the **References section**. The relevant citation for the Yelp dataset is:

- **Yelp Dataset Challenge**: 
  > Yelp. *Yelp Dataset Challenge, Round 8*. https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge, 2017.

Since the authors used a specific round of the Yelp dataset, I will note that in my documentation.

Now, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset:

1. **Yelp Dataset**: The authors utilized a dataset consisting of 500K sentences sampled from Yelp reviews for training their autocomplete system.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
