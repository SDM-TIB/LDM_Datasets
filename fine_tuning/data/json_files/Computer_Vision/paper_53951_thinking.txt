To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ACT: Semi-supervised Domain-adaptive Medical Image Segmentation with Asymmetric Co-Training" by Xiaofeng Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **BraTS18 database** for cross-modality brain tumor MRI segmentation tasks, which indicates that this dataset is likely important for the research.

Next, I will check the **introduction** for any additional context or details about the datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of domain adaptation in medical imaging but does not introduce new datasets beyond what is mentioned in the abstract.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any specific details about how the datasets are used in the experiments. The authors mention using the **BraTS2018 database**, which contains MRI scans from 285 patients, and provides details about the types of MRI scans included (T1-weighted, T1-contrast enhanced, T2-weighted, and FLAIR). This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its application in the study.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their evaluation protocols and how they utilize the BraTS18 database for segmentation tasks. They mention the segmentation labels and the classes involved, which further emphasizes the importance of this dataset in their research.

Finally, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the BraTS18 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Menze, B.H., Jakab, A., Bauer, S., Kalpathy-Cramer, J., Farahani, K., Kirby, J., Burren, Y., Porz, N., Slotboom, J., Wiest, R., et al. *The multimodal brain tumor image segmentation benchmark (BRATS)*. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 34(10), 1993â€“2024, 2014.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. The key dataset extracted is the **BraTS18 database**, which is crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.
