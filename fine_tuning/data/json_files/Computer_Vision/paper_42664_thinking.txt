To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the effectiveness of convolutional autoencoders on image-based personalized recommender systems" by Eva Blanco-Mallo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets or sources of data.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of their research, particularly focusing on TripAdvisor data. This suggests that the datasets may be related to user reviews and images from TripAdvisor.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experimental results** sections. In this paper, the authors explicitly describe three datasets collected from TripAdvisor reviews in different cities: Santiago de Compostela, Barcelona, and New York. 

The details provided in the **experimental results section** include:
1. **Santiago de Compostela Dataset**: Contains 7,003 reviews with images, 16,168 images total.
2. **Barcelona Dataset**: Contains 66,904 reviews with images, 153,707 images total.
3. **New York Dataset**: Contains 111,415 reviews with images, 234,689 images total.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are derived from TripAdvisor, I will note that the citation for the source of the data is not a traditional dataset citation but rather a reference to the TripAdvisor platform itself.

The citation for the TripAdvisor data can be summarized as:
> TripAdvisor. "TripAdvisor Reviews." [https://www.tripadvisor.com](https://www.tripadvisor.com).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the names, descriptions, and citations for each dataset. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
