To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Texture Scale-Constrained Universal Adversarial Perturbation" by Yihao Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on "four classical datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors state that they evaluated their proposed method on the **ImageNet validation set**, which consists of 50,000 images. This is a well-known dataset in the field of computer vision.

Additionally, the authors mention conducting experiments on **CIFAR10**, **CIFAR100**, and **Places-365**. I will need to gather more details about these datasets, such as their characteristics and the number of classes they contain.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide the following details:
- **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset for image classification with 1,000 classes.
- **CIFAR10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images.
- **Places-365**: A scene recognition dataset with 365 classes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:
- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > O. Russakovsky et al. "ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge." *International Journal of Computer Vision*, vol. 115, no. 3, pp. 211â€“252, 2015.
  
- For **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > A. Krizhevsky, G. Hinton. "Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images." 2009.
  
- For **Places-365**, the citation is:
  > B. Zhou et al. "Places: A 10 Million Image Database for Scene Recognition." *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*, 2017.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
