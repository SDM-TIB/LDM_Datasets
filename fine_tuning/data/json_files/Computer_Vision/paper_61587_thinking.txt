To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RealignDiff: Boosting Text-to-Image Diffusion Model with Coarse-to-fine Semantic Re-alignment" by Guian Fang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that experimental results were demonstrated on the **MS-COCO benchmark**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In the **Experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets they utilized. They state that their approach is trained on the **Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS-COCO)** dataset, which contains 82,783 training and 40,504 validation text-image pairs. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Additionally, the authors mention two other datasets: **Attribute Binding Contrast set (ABC-6K)** and **Concept Conjunction 500 (CC-500)**. The ABC-6K dataset is derived from natural prompts within MS-COCO and contains prompts with color descriptors modifying distinct objects. The CC-500 dataset consists of simpler prompts that combine two concepts.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **MS-COCO Dataset**:

2. **ABC-6K Dataset**:

3. **CC-500 Dataset**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
