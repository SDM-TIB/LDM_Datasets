To extract datasets from the research paper titled "InternVideo: General Video Foundation Models via Generative and Discriminative Learning" by Yi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on **39 video datasets**, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Data for Pretraining)**, where the authors provide a detailed summary of the datasets used for pretraining their model. Here, they list several datasets along with their characteristics:

1. **Kinetics-400**: A widely used dataset for action recognition containing 240,000 video clips.
   - Citation: 
     > Joao Carreira and Andrew Zisserman. *Quo vadis, action recognition? A new model and the kinetics dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

2. **Kinetics-710**: A customized dataset that combines unique training data from Kinetics 400/600/700, containing 650,000 videos with 710 unique action labels.
   - Citation: 
     > Kunchang Li, Yali Wang, Yinan He, Yizhuo Li, Yi Wang, Limin Wang, and Yu Qiao. *Uniformer: Unified transformer for efficient spatial-temporal representation learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.09552, 2022.

3. **Something-Something V2**: A dataset for learning visual common sense, containing 169,000 video clips.
   - Citation: 
     > Raghav Goyal et al. *The "something something" video database for learning and evaluating visual common sense*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2017.

4. **AVA**: A dataset for spatio-temporally localized atomic visual actions, containing 21,000 video clips.
   - Citation: 
     > Chunhui Gu et al. *AVA: A video dataset of spatio-temporally localized atomic visual actions*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

5. **WebVid2M**: A dataset consisting of 250,000 web videos.
   - Citation: 
     > Antoine Miech et al. *HowTo100M: Learning a text-video embedding by watching hundred million narrated video clips*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019.

6. **HowTo100M**: A large-scale dataset of instructional videos, containing 1.2 million clips.
   - Citation: 
     > Antoine Miech et al. *HowTo100M: Learning a text-video embedding by watching hundred million narrated video clips*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019.

7. **Self-collected videos**: Videos collected from various sources, totaling 250,000 clips.
   - No formal citation as this is self-collected data.

Next, I will ensure to check the **References section** for any additional datasets mentioned throughout the paper that may not have been included in the primary dataset summary.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research in the field.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and use in future work.
