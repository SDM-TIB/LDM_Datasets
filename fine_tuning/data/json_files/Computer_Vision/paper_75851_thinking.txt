To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BoostMVSNeRFs: Boosting MVS-based NeRFs to Generalizable View Synthesis in Large-scale Scenes" by Chih-Hai Su et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors demonstrate their method through experiments on large-scale datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), particularly **subsection 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they list two datasets:

1. **Free Dataset**: Collected by F2-NeRF, this dataset consists of seven challenging scenes featuring narrow, long camera trajectories and focused foreground objects.

2. **ScanNet Dataset**: This dataset is known for its richly annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes and is widely used in the field.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Free Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, G., Chen, Z., Loy, C. C., & Liu, Z. (2023). F2-NeRF: Fast Neural Radiance Field Training with Free Camera Trajectories. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023.

- For the **ScanNet Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dai, A., Chang, A. X., Savva, M., Halber, M., Funkhouser, T., & Nie√üner, M. (2017). ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
