To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Accurate Binary Neural Networks via Modeling Contextual Dependencies" by Xingrun Xing et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions that the proposed BCDNet achieves results on the **ImageNet-1K classification benchmark**, indicating that this dataset is likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** for any additional datasets that might be mentioned. In section 5.1 (Implementation Details), the authors specify that they trained and evaluated their models on the **ImageNet-1K dataset**, which contains 1.28 million images for training and 50,000 images for validation. This confirms that ImageNet-1K is a primary dataset used in their research.

I will also look for any references to other datasets in the **related work** or **results sections**. In section 5.3 (Generalization to Fine-grained Datasets), the authors mention evaluating their models on several fine-grained datasets, including:

1. **CUB-200-2011**: A dataset for fine-grained image categorization of birds.
2. **Oxford Flowers 102**: A dataset for fine-grained classification of flowers.
3. **Stanford Cars**: A dataset for fine-grained classification of cars.
4. **Stanford Dogs**: A dataset for fine-grained classification of dog breeds.
5. **Aircraft**: A dataset for fine-grained classification of aircraft.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper:

- For **ImageNet-1K**, the citation is:
  > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3), 211–252, 2015.

- For **CUB-200-2011**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., Belongie, S. *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*. 2011.

- For **Oxford Flowers 102**, the citation is:
  > Nilsback, M.E., Zisserman, A. *Automated Flower Classification over a Large Number of Classes*. In: 2008 Sixth Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics & Image Processing, 722–729, 2008.

- For **Stanford Cars**, the citation is:
  > Krause, J., Stark, M., Deng, J., Fei-Fei, L. *3D Object Representations for Fine-Grained Categorization*. In: Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops, 554–561, 2013.

- For **Stanford Dogs**, the citation is:
  > Khosla, A., Jayadevaprakash, N., Yao, B., Li, F.F. *Novel Dataset for Fine-Grained Image Categorization: Stanford Dogs*. In: Proc. CVPR Workshop on Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC), 2011.

- For **Aircraft**, the citation is:
  > Maji, S., Rahtu, E., Kannala, J., Blaschko, M., Vedaldi, A. *Fine-Grained Visual Classification of Aircraft*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1306.5151, 2013.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
