To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Granularity-adjusted Pixel-level Semantic Annotation" by Rohit Kundu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on the **PASCAL VOC 2012** and **COCO-80** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are significant for their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (specifically section 4.1) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **PASCAL VOC 2012**: This dataset consists of 1,449 images with annotations for 20 object classes. It is noted for its diversity, as each image may contain multiple objects, making it a versatile benchmark for evaluating segmentation algorithms.

2. **COCO-80**: This dataset includes 80 classes and presents a complex multi-object scene understanding challenge. It features diverse object categories and rich annotations, including instance-level segmentation masks, which go beyond traditional semantic segmentation datasets.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **PASCAL VOC 2012**, the citation is:
  > M. Everingham, L. Van Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2012 (VOC2012) Results*. Available at: http://www.pascal-network.org/challenges/VOC/voc2012/workshop/index.html.

- For **COCO-80**, the citation is:
  > T. Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollar, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Computer Vision – ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V, pages 740–755. Springer, 2014.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
