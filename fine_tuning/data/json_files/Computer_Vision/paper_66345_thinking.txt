To extract datasets from the research paper titled "P3SUM: Preserving Author’s Perspective in News Summarization with Diffusion Language Models" by Yuhan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three news summarization datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present. I will note the names of these datasets for further investigation.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section (Section 4)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **CNN/DM Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a popular benchmark for text summarization tasks.
2. **XSUM Dataset**: Another dataset mentioned, known for extreme summarization tasks.
3. **POLITICS Dataset**: This dataset is specifically designed for political news articles and includes labels for political leaning.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The citations I will look for are:

- For the **CNN/DM Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nallapati, R., Zhou, B., Gulcehre, C., & Xiang, B. (2016). *Abstractive text summarization using sequence-to-sequence RNNs and beyond*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1602.06023.

- For the **XSUM Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Narayan, S., Cohen, S. B., & Lapata, M. (2018). *Don’t give me the details, just the summary!* In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 19-30.

- For the **POLITICS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Y., Sap, M., Lu, X., Swayamdipta, S., Bhagavatula, C., Smith, N. A., & Choi, Y. (2022). *POLITICS: Pretraining with same-story article comparison for ideology prediction and stance detection*. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: NAACL 2022, pages 1354-1374.

Once I have gathered the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for future reference or research.
