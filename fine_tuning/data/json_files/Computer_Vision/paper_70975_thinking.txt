To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Magic Fixup: Streamlining Photo Editing by Watching Dynamic Videos" by Hadi Alzayer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed an image dataset from video pairs, which suggests that there is a specific dataset involved in their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any relevant subsections that might provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this paper, the authors describe their dataset generation process in **section 3.5 (Training with paired supervision from video data)**. Here, they explain that they built a paired dataset from a large-scale video corpus, consisting of 12 million clips, and filtered it down to 2.5 million clips for training.

The dataset is described as follows:

1. **Paired Image Dataset**: This dataset consists of pairs of frames extracted from videos, where each pair includes a source frame and a target frame. The authors mention that they sampled these pairs from a large-scale video corpus, ensuring that the frames are taken at random time intervals to create a diverse dataset. The total number of samples in this dataset is 5 million, as they used two motion models to generate the pairs.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is constructed from a large-scale video corpus and does not have a specific citation like traditional datasets, I will note that the dataset is derived from a collection of stock videos, but no specific reference is provided in the paper.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is:

- **Paired Image Dataset**: A dataset consisting of 5 million samples of paired frames extracted from a large-scale video corpus, specifically designed for training their model.

Since there is no specific citation for the dataset, I will note that it is based on a collection of stock videos filtered for dynamic scenes.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I have accurately captured the dataset details and any relevant citations.
