To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DaLPSR: Leverage Degradation-Aligned Language Prompt for Real-World Image Super-Resolution" by Aiwen Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on several popular synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention the following datasets:

1. **DIV2K Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as being used for training, consisting of high-resolution images. The authors note that they randomly crop HR images to a size of 512×512 for their experiments.

2. **DRealSR Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as one of the real-world benchmark datasets used for evaluation. The authors describe it as containing various real-world images for testing the proposed method.

3. **RealSR Dataset**: Another real-world dataset used for evaluation, which also contains images of various sizes.

4. **RealLR200 Dataset**: This dataset is specifically noted for its practical use, containing low-resolution images of various sizes.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **DIV2K Dataset**, the citation is:
  > E. Agustsson and R. Timofte, "Ntire 2017 challenge on single image super-resolution: Dataset and study," in Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition workshops, 2017, pp. 126–135.

- For **DRealSR Dataset**, the citation is:

- For **RealSR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > P. Wei, Z. Xie, H. Lu, Z. Zhan, Q. Ye, W. Zuo, and L. Lin, "Component divide-and-conquer for real-world image super-resolution," in Proceedings of European conference computer vision, 2020, pp. 101–117.

- For **RealLR200 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Wu, T. Yang, L. Sun, Z. Zhang, S. Li, and L. Zhang, "SeeSR: Towards semantics-aware real-world image super-resolution," in Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, 2024, pp. 25 456–25 467.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
