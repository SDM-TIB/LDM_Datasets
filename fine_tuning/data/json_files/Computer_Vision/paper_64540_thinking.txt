To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Are Large Language Models Really Robust to Word-Level Perturbations?" by Haoyu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the evaluation of LLMs and hints at the use of specific datasets for this purpose. In the introduction, the authors mention that traditional evaluation methods rely on datasets like GLUE and ANLI, which suggests that these datasets are relevant to their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant subsections within the paper. In this case, I find that **section 3.1** explicitly mentions the **Natural Questions (NQ)** dataset, which is used for evaluating the generative capabilities of LLMs. The authors describe how they selected 1,000 open questions from this dataset to assess the robustness of LLMs.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Natural Questions dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Tom Kwiatkowski, Jennimaria Palomaki, Olivia Redfield, Michael Collins, Ankur Parikh, Chris Alberti, Danielle Epstein, Illia Polosukhin, Jacob Devlin, Kenton Lee, et al. *Natural Questions: A Benchmark for Question Answering Research*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 7:453â€“466, 2019.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Natural Questions (NQ)**: This dataset is a question-answering dataset that provides both short and long answer labels. However, the authors specifically selected 1,000 open questions from a larger set to leverage the generative capabilities of LLMs.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included, as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference in future research.

In summary, I have successfully extracted the relevant dataset from the paper and documented it with the necessary citation.
