To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rickrolling the Artist: Injecting Backdoors into Text Encoders for Text-to-Image Synthesis" by Lukas Struppek et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of text-to-image synthesis models and mention that they rely on large datasets of public image-text pairs. This indicates that datasets are crucial to their research, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention using the **LAION-Aesthetics v2 6.5+** dataset for injecting backdoors and the **MS-COCO 2014 validation split** for evaluation. 

1. **LAION-Aesthetics v2 6.5+**: This dataset is used for training the models to inject backdoors. It is a large-scale dataset that contains image-text pairs curated for aesthetic quality.

2. **MS-COCO 2014**: This dataset is utilized for evaluation purposes, specifically the validation split containing 40,504 samples. It is a well-known dataset in the field of computer vision, providing a rich set of images with corresponding captions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **LAION-Aesthetics v2 6.5+**, the citation is:
  > Christoph Schuhmann, Romain Beaumont, Cade W Gordon, Ross Wightman, Mehdi Cherti, Theo Coombes, Aarush Katta, Clayton Mullis, Patrick Schramowski, Srivatsa R Kundurthy, Katherine Crowson, Richard Vencu, Ludwig Schmidt, Robert Kaczmarczyk, and Jenia Jitsev. *LAION-5B: An open large-scale dataset for training next generation image-text models*. In Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), pages 25278–25294, 2022.

- For **MS-COCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge J. Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
