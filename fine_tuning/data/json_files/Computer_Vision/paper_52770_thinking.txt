To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Time-inhomogeneous diffusion geometry and topology" by Guillaume Huguet et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the paper's focus and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions the use of "diﬀusion condensation" and its applications, which may imply the use of specific datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors discuss various applications of diﬀusion condensation, which may involve specific datasets. I will pay close attention to any examples or case studies that are provided.

As I read through the paper, I will note down any datasets that are explicitly named or described, including their characteristics, such as the number of samples, dimensions, and any specific features that are highlighted. If the authors refer to datasets used in previous works, I will ensure to capture those references as well.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper attribution is necessary for academic integrity. I will look for the original papers or sources where these datasets were introduced or described.

For each dataset, I will compile the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains, including its size and any relevant features.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that it is clearly organized and formatted correctly for easy reference. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
