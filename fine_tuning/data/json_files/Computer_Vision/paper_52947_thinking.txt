To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Complex Recurrent Variational Autoencoder with Application to Speech Enhancement" by Yuying Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experiments are based on the **TIMIT dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely important for the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In **section IV (Experiment)**, the authors explicitly state that they used the **TIMIT dataset** for their experiments. They describe the dataset as containing **4620 utterances**, with specific subsets for training, validation, and testing. This section also mentions a noise dataset used in conjunction with TIMIT, which includes six different noise types.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the TIMIT dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> J. S. Garofolo, L. F. Lamel, W. Fisher, J. Fiscus, and D. Pallett. *DARPA TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus CD-ROM. NIST Speech Disc 1-1.1*. NASA STI/Recon Technical Report N, vol. 93, p. 27403, 1993.

Additionally, the authors mention a noise dataset used in their experiments, which is based on the work referenced as paper [35]. I will also look up the citation for that noise dataset. The citation is:
> M. Kolbæk, Z.-H. Tan, and J. Jensen. *Speech enhancement using long short-term memory based recurrent neural networks for noise robust speaker verification*. In IEEE SLT Workshop, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **TIMIT Dataset**: Used for training, validation, and testing in the experiments. It consists of 4620 utterances.
   - Citation: J. S. Garofolo, L. F. Lamel, W. Fisher, J. Fiscus, and D. Pallett. *DARPA TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus CD-ROM. NIST Speech Disc 1-1.1*. NASA STI/Recon Technical Report N, vol. 93, p. 27403, 1993.

2. **Noise Dataset**: Contains six different noise types used for generating noisy speech data.
   - Citation: M. Kolbæk, Z.-H. Tan, and J. Jensen. *Speech enhancement using long short-term memory based recurrent neural networks for noise robust speaker verification*. In IEEE SLT Workshop, 2016.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
