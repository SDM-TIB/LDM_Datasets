To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Development of deep learning algorithms to categorize free-text notes pertaining to diabetes" by Boyi Yang and Adam Wright, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves **2,000 EHR progress notes** from patients with diabetes, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, specifically the part that discusses the creation and annotation of data samples. Here, the authors describe how they retrieved **2,000 EHR progress notes** from Brigham and Women’s Hospital, divided into **1,000 for training** and **1,000 for testing**. Additionally, they mention another **1,000 notes from the University of Texas Physicians** for validation. This gives me three distinct datasets to document.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their models on these datasets, confirming their relevance and use in the experiments.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset from the **references section**:

1. **Brigham and Women’s Hospital Dataset**: This dataset consists of **2,000 EHR progress notes** (1,000 for training and 1,000 for testing) from patients with diabetes. The citation for the original study that introduced this dataset is:
   > Adam Wright, Allison B McCoy, Stanislav Henkin, Abhivyakti Kale, and Dean F Sittig. *Use of a support vector machine for categorizing free-text notes: assessment of accuracy across two institutions*. Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 20(5):887–890, 2013.

2. **University of Texas Physicians Dataset**: This dataset includes **1,000 EHR outpatient notes** for validation, annotated as diabetic or non-diabetic. The citation for the original study is the same as above, as it refers to the same methodology:
   > Adam Wright, Allison B McCoy, Stanislav Henkin, Abhivyakti Kale, and Dean F Sittig. *Use of a support vector machine for categorizing free-text notes: assessment of accuracy across two institutions*. Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 20(5):887–890, 2013.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing. Each dataset will be clearly defined with its citation to ensure proper attribution and reference.
