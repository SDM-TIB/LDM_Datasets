To extract datasets from the research paper titled "COTS: Collaborative Two-Stream Vision-Language Pre-Training Model for Cross-Modal Retrieval" by Haoyu Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on various datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Settings)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for pre-training and evaluation. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **CC4M**: This dataset contains 4 million images and 5.3 million captions sourced from various datasets including Conceptual Captions (CC3M), SBU, VG, and MSCOCO.

2. **CC14M**: This dataset is an extension of CC4M, consisting of 14 million images and 15.3 million captions, but it is noted to be noisier than CC4M.

3. **MSCOCO**: A well-known dataset with 123,287 images, each annotated with 5 captions. The authors mention using the Karpathy split for their experiments.

4. **Flickr30K**: This dataset contains 31,000 images and 158,915 captions, with a specific split for training, validation, and testing.

5. **MSR-VTT**: A video-text dataset comprising 10,000 YouTube videos and 200,000 captions, used for evaluating text-to-video retrieval.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MSCOCO**:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755, 2014.

- For **Flickr30K**:
  > Bryan A Plummer, Liwei Wang, Chris M Cervantes, Juan C Caicedo, Julia Hockenmaier, and Svetlana Lazebnik. *Flickr30k entities: Collecting region-to-phrase correspondences for richer image-to-sentence models*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2641–2649, 2015.

- For **Conceptual Captions (CC3M)**, **SBU**, and **VG**, I will need to look for their respective citations in the references. 

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in organizing the information effectively for further processing or review.
