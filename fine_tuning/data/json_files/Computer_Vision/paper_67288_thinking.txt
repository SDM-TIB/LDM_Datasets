To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalized Contrastive Divergence: Joint Training of Energy-Based Model and Diffusion Model through Inverse Reinforcement Learning" by Sangwoong Yoon et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and may mention datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on a **synthetic dataset** consisting of **2D 8 Gaussians data**. This indicates that there is at least one dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to see if there are any citations related to the datasets mentioned. However, since the authors only refer to a synthetic dataset, there may not be a formal citation for it. In this case, I will note that the dataset is synthetic and does not have a formal citation.

Now, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Synthetic Dataset (2D 8 Gaussians)**: This dataset is used for preliminary experimental results. It consists of samples generated from a mixture of eight Gaussian distributions in a two-dimensional space. Since this is a synthetic dataset created for the purpose of the experiments, it does not have a formal citation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry. Since the only dataset mentioned is synthetic and lacks a formal citation, I will note that in the dataset entry.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in a structured format, ensuring that I clearly indicate the nature of the dataset and the absence of a formal citation.
