To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Teaching GANs to Sketch in Vector Format" by Varshaneya V et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset called **QuickDraw**, which is a strong indicator that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for training and experimentation. Here, they mention:

1. **QuickDraw Dataset**: This dataset consists of sketches belonging to 345 different categories, with each category containing 75,000 sketches for training, 2,500 for validation, and 2,500 for testing. This dataset is crucial as it is the only large dataset with sketches in vector format used for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they trained their models (SkeGAN and VASkeGAN) on the QuickDraw dataset, which further validates its importance in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the QuickDraw dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For **QuickDraw Dataset**:
  > Ha, D., & Eck, D. (2018). A neural representation of sketch drawings. In International Conference on Learning Representations.

This citation is essential for proper attribution and should be included in the dataset entry.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
