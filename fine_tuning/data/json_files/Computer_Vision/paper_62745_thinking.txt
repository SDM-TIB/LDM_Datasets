To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-Time Percussive Technique Recognition and Embedding Learning for the Acoustic Guitar" by Andrea Martelloni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the collection of three datasets labeled according to a taxonomy of guitar body percussion. This indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to identify.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Methodology)**, particularly **subsection 3.1 (From taxonomy to datasets)**, where the authors describe the creation of the datasets. Here, they mention the following datasets:

1. **GPercRep**: This dataset consists of 3,157 examples of guitar body percussion hits, recorded at various dynamics levels. It was created by producing examples based on a taxonomy of guitar body percussion. The dataset is not publicly available.

2. **GPercHeel**: This dataset contains 601 heel hits, acquired and labeled with the same taxonomy as GPercRep. It was created to address a bias observed in the classification of heel hits.

3. **GPercPat**: This dataset consists of real-world guitar percussion patterns, recorded with a different audio interface. It contains 85 hits labeled as either "kick" or "non-kick."

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since GPercRep is not publicly available, it may not have a formal citation. I will still note the details provided in the paper for GPercHeel and GPercPat.

- For **GPercHeel**, the dataset is derived from the same taxonomy as GPercRep, but no specific citation is provided since it is also not publicly available.

- For **GPercPat**, similar to GPercHeel, it does not have a formal citation as it is a newly created dataset for this study.

Since the datasets are not publicly available and do not have formal citations, I will document the details as described in the paper without formal citations for these specific datasets.

Finally, I will summarize the findings for each dataset, ensuring to include the relevant details as outlined in the paper, while acknowledging the lack of formal citations for the non-public datasets.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that highlights the key attributes of each dataset, ready for further processing or review.
