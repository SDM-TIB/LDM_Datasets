To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Orthogonal Adaptation for Modular Customization of Diffusion Models" by Ryan Po et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their method on a **custom dataset of 12 concept identities**, each containing 16 unique images of the target concept in different contexts. This indicates that there is a specific dataset used for their experiments.

I will also check the **experiments section** for any additional details about the dataset, such as its purpose, characteristics, and how it was utilized in the study. The authors describe the dataset as being tailored for evaluating identity alignment in generated images, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

After identifying the dataset, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. Since the paper does not provide a specific external dataset reference, I will note that the dataset is a custom one created by the authors for their specific experiments.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation. Since this dataset is custom and does not have an external citation, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset created for the study.

In summary, the steps I will take are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Look for a dedicated datasets section or mentions in the methodology/experiments sections.
3. Gather details about the dataset, including its purpose and characteristics.
4. Check the references for any citations related to the dataset.
5. Compile the dataset information, ensuring to include a full citation where applicable.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
