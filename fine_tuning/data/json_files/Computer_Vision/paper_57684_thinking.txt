To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DifFace: Blind Face Restoration with Diffused Error Contraction" by Zongsheng Yue and Chen Change Loy, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the method and its capabilities, but I need to look for specific dataset names.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of blind face restoration and the need for high-quality datasets for training and evaluation. However, I need to find explicit mentions of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 6 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **CelebA-HQ Dataset**: This dataset contains 70,000 high-quality face images and is used for training the restoration model. The authors specify that they resize the images to 512x512 and synthesize low-quality images from them.

2. **LFW-Test Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,711 mildly degraded face images, each representing a different individual from the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset.

3. **WebPhoto-Test Dataset**: This dataset includes 407 face images crawled from the internet, which may contain various degrees of degradation.

4. **WIDER-Test Dataset**: This dataset comprises 970 face images with severe degradations, selected from the WIDER Face dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

- For **CelebA-HQ**, the citation is:
  > Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. *A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 4401–4410, 2019.

- For **LFW**, the citation is:
  > Gary B Huang, Marwan Mattar, Tamara Berg, and Eric Learned-Miller. *Labeled faces in the wild: A database for studying face recognition in unconstrained environments*. In Workshop on faces in ‘Real-Life’ Images: detection, alignment, and recognition, 2008.

- For **WIDER Face**, the citation is:
  > Shuo Yang, Ping Luo, Chen-Change Loy, and Xiaoou Tang. *Wider face: A face detection benchmark*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 5525–5533, 2016.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and attributed.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing.
