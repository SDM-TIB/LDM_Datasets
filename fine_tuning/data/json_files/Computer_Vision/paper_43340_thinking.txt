To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DoQA - Accessing Domain-Specific FAQs via Conversational QA" by Jon Ander Campos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the creation of a dataset called **DoQA**, which consists of 2,437 dialogues and 10,917 QA pairs collected from Stack Exchange sites. This indicates that there is a primary dataset to focus on.

Next, I will look into the **dataset collection section** (Section 3) to gather more details about the **DoQA dataset**. Here, the authors describe the dataset's characteristics, including the domains it covers (Cooking, Travel, and Movies) and the methodology used for data collection. They explain that the dialogues were created using the Wizard of Oz technique with crowdworkers, which adds context to the dataset's construction.

In Section 3.3, the authors provide specific statistics about the dataset, including the number of dialogues and questions per domain. This section confirms that the **DoQA dataset** is indeed the main dataset of interest.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **DoQA dataset**. The paper states that the dataset is available online, which is crucial for proper citation. The citation for the dataset is as follows:
> Campos, J. A., Otegi, A., Soroa, A., Deriu, J., Cieliebak, M., & Agirre, E. (2020). DoQA: Accessing Domain-Specific FAQs via Conversational QA. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 1-10.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the key details of the **DoQA dataset**:

1. **Dataset Name**: DoQA
   - **Description**: A dataset for accessing domain-specific FAQs via conversational QA, containing 2,437 dialogues and 10,917 QA pairs across three domains (Cooking, Travel, Movies).
   - **Collection Method**: Collected from Stack Exchange using the Wizard of Oz technique with crowdworkers.
   - **Domains Covered**: Cooking, Travel, Movies.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation is included for the **DoQA dataset**.
