To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Smooth p-Wasserstein Distance: Structure, Empirical Approximation, and Statistical Applications" by Sloan Nietert, Ziv Goldfeld, and Kengo Kato, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the empirical approximation of the p-Wasserstein distance and its applications, which may hint at the datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their empirical evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant.

In this paper, the authors mention using empirical distributions and refer to various statistical applications, but I need to find specific datasets. I will check for sections that might detail the datasets, such as "Data" or "Experimental Setup."

If the datasets are not explicitly named in the main sections, I will consult the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited or referenced. This could include foundational datasets used in the experiments or any datasets that the authors have created or modified for their research.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to gather the following information for each:

1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details (e.g., number of samples, features).
3. **Full Citation**: The complete citation for the dataset, which may include authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if I find a dataset named "Sample Dataset," I would note it down as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Sample Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset containing 1,000 samples for testing the p-Wasserstein distance.
- **Full Citation**: Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. Year. URL or DOI if available.

After compiling this information for each dataset, I will format it according to the required structure, ensuring that the full citations are included for proper attribution.

Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset entries.
