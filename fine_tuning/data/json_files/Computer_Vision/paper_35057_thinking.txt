To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Natural Language Processing for EHR-Based Computational Phenotyping" by Zexian Zeng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract discusses various applications of NLP in EHRs, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, it sets the stage for understanding the context in which datasets might be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **methods and applications sections** for any references to specific datasets. In the applications section, the authors mention various applications of computational phenotyping, such as diagnosis categorization and novel phenotype discovery, but again, no specific datasets are named.

I will then look closely at the **methods section**, particularly focusing on any subsections that might detail the datasets used in the studies referenced. The authors discuss various methodologies and algorithms but do not provide explicit dataset names.

Moving on to the **references section**, I will check for any cited studies that may have utilized specific datasets. This is crucial because even if the main paper does not mention datasets directly, the referenced studies might provide insights into the datasets used in computational phenotyping.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I will compile a list of datasets mentioned in the references. For each dataset, I will ensure to extract the full citation as it is critical for proper attribution. 

For example, if I find that a dataset like the "MIMIC-III Clinical Database" is referenced in the context of EHR data, I will note the citation as follows:
- **MIMIC-III Clinical Database**: 
  > Johnson, A. E. W., Pollard, T. J., Shen, L., et al. "MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database." *Scientific Data*, vol. 3, p. 160035, 2016.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation, formatted correctly for clarity and completeness. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
