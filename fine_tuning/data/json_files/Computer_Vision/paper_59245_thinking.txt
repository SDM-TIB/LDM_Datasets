To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Open-Ended Medical Visual Question Answering Through Prefix Tuning of Language Models" by Tom van Sonsbeek et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method on **three prime medical VQA benchmarks**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. They mention:

1. **Slake**: This dataset is described as having 642 images and 14,028 questions, with a mean length of questions being 4.52 and a mean length of answers being 1.21. It contains 461 unique answers.

2. **OVQA**: This dataset consists of 2,001 images and 19,020 questions, with a mean question length of 8.98 and a mean answer length of 3.31. It has 641 unique answers.

3. **PathVQA**: This dataset includes 4,998 images and 32,799 questions, with a mean question length of 6.36 and a mean answer length of 1.80. It features 3,182 unique answers.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Slake**, the citation is:
  > Liu, B., Zhan, L.M., Xu, L., Ma, L., Yang, Y., Wu, X.M. *Slake: A semantically-labeled knowledge-enhanced dataset for medical visual question answering*. In: ISBI. pp. 1650–1654. IEEE (2021).

- For **OVQA**, the citation is:
  > Huang, Y., Wang, X., Liu, F., Huang, G. *OVQA: A clinically generated visual question answering dataset*. In: ACM SIGIR. pp. 2924–2938. (2022).

- For **PathVQA**, the citation is:
  > He, X., Zhang, Y., Mou, L., Xing, E., Xie, P. *Pathvqa: 30000+ questions for medical visual question answering*. arXiv:2003.10286 (2020).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as outlined in the paper.
