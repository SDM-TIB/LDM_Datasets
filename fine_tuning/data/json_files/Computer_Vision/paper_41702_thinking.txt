To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spectral-GANs for High-Resolution 3D Point-cloud Generation" by Sameera Ramasinghe et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the synthesis and reconstruction of high-quality point-clouds, which suggests that datasets related to 3D point-clouds might be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** to identify any datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors typically describe the datasets they used to validate their model. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **ModelNet10 dataset** for their experiments. This dataset is commonly used for 3D shape classification and generation tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ModelNet10 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Wu, Zhirong, Shuran Song, Aditya Khosla, Fisher Yu, Linguang Zhang, Xiaoou Tang, and Jianxiong Xiao. "3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shapes." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 1912â€“1920, 2015.

Additionally, the paper references the **ShapeNet dataset**, which is another important dataset for 3D shape analysis. I will also look for its citation in the references. The citation for ShapeNet is:
> Yi, Li, Vladimir G. Kim, Duygu Ceylan, I Shen, Mengyan Yan, Hao Su, Cewu Lu, Qixing Huang, Alla Sheffer, and Leonidas Guibas. "A Scalable Active Framework for Region Annotation in 3D Shape Collections." ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG) 35, no. 6 (2016): 210.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets identified in the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
