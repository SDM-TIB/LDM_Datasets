To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Synthesising Electronic Health Records: Cystic Fibrosis Patient Group" by Emily Muller et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the collection of **Cystic Fibrosis EHRs** and the synthesis of new patient records, indicating that a specific dataset is being utilized. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of synthetic data in healthcare, particularly for underrepresented patient groups, which suggests that the authors are working with a specific dataset related to Cystic Fibrosis.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** section. In this paper, the authors describe the extraction of **Cystic Fibrosis patients from the IBM Explorys database**, which is a key dataset for their study. They mention that a total of **10,074 patients** were extracted, representing about one-third of all CF patients in the US.

I will also check the **results** and **discussion** sections for any additional datasets or references to other datasets that may have been used for comparison or validation purposes. However, the primary focus appears to be on the IBM Explorys dataset.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the IBM Explorys database. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the IBM Explorys database, but it is important to note that the authors reference the **US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (USCFF) 2020** report, which provides context for the dataset they are using.

The citation for the USCFF report is:
> USCFF. 2020. Patient Registry Annual Data Report. https://www.cff.org/media/23476/download. Accessed: 07-12-2021.

Since the IBM Explorys database is a proprietary dataset, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. However, I will note its significance in the context of the research.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **Cystic Fibrosis EHRs from the IBM Explorys database**: This dataset includes electronic health records of 10,074 Cystic Fibrosis patients.

The full citation for the USCFF report, which provides context for the dataset, is:
> USCFF. 2020. Patient Registry Annual Data Report. https://www.cff.org/media/23476/download. Accessed: 07-12-2021.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
