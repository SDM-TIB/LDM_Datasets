To extract datasets from the research paper titled "pose-format: Library for Viewing, Augmenting, and Handling .pose Files" by Amit Moryossef et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the toolkit's capabilities but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the complexities of managing pose data and the need for a unified interface, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned. I will continue to the **background section** to see if any datasets are referenced in relation to existing pose estimation systems.

In the **background**, the authors mention systems like OpenPose and MediaPipe Holistic, but they do not provide specific datasets. I will then check the **benchmarking section** where they compare their library against OpenPose. Here, they mention obtaining OpenPose data from the **Public DGS Corpus**.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the Public DGS Corpus. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Thomas Hanke, Marc Schulder, Reiner Konrad, and Elena Jahn. *Extending the Public DGS Corpus in size and depth*. In Proceedings of the LREC2020 9th Workshop on the Representation and Processing of Sign Languages: Sign Language Resources in the Service of the Language Community, Technological Challenges and Application Perspectives, pages 75â€“82, Marseille, France. European Language Resources Association (ELRA), 2020.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will summarize my findings. The only dataset explicitly referenced in the paper is the **Public DGS Corpus**, which is used for benchmarking against OpenPose.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Public DGS Corpus, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

After compiling this information, I will be ready to present the dataset entry in the specified format for further processing or review.
