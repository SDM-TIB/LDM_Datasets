To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Graph Federated Architecture with Privacy Preserving Learning" by Elsa Rizk and Ali H. Sayed, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses federated learning and privacy but does not specify any datasets. The introduction also focuses on the architecture and privacy aspects without naming datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experimental results section** more closely, as this is where datasets are typically described. In this section, the authors mention generating a set of data points for each client, specifically stating: "We generate a set of data points {Î³p,k(n), hp,k,n}100 n=1 for each client." However, they do not provide a specific dataset name or reference to an existing dataset.

Since the paper does not reference any publicly available datasets or provide full citations for any datasets used, I will note that there are no datasets extracted from this paper that can be cited. The authors seem to have created synthetic data for their experiments rather than using established datasets.

Finally, I will summarize my findings. There are no datasets mentioned in the paper that can be cited, as the authors generated their own data points for the experiments. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no dataset entries to create in the specified format.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were found in the paper, and thus no citations can be provided.
