To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust and Interpretable Grounding of Spatial References with Relation Networks" by Tsung-Yen Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments across three tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets or references to them in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup** section, particularly **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the tasks they performed. Here, they mention using three different datasets for their experiments:

1. **ShapeWorld**: This dataset is used for a classification task where the goal is to predict whether a given instruction matches a scene containing abstract objects. The authors provide a brief description of the dataset's structure and purpose.

2. **PuddleWorld**: This dataset is utilized for value map regression and goal navigation tasks. The authors describe the environment and the types of instructions provided, indicating how the dataset is structured.

3. **ISI (Instruction Following Dataset)**: This dataset is also used for the value map regression task. The authors describe the nature of the instructions and the objects involved in the dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **ShapeWorld**, the citation is:
  > Jacob Andreas, Dan Klein, and Sergey Levine. *Learning with latent language*. In Proceedings of the Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 2166–2179, 2018.

- For **PuddleWorld**, the citation is:
  > Dipendra Misra, John Langford, and Yoav Artzi. *Mapping instructions and visual observations to actions with reinforcement learning*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1004–1015, 2017.

- For **ISI**, the citation is:
  > Yonatan Bisk, Deniz Yuret, and Daniel Marcu. *Natural language communication with robots*. In Proceedings of the Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 751–761, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper references.
