To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TabDDPM: Modelling Tabular Data with Diffusion Models" by Akim Kotelnikov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they state that they consider a diverse set of 15 real-world public datasets for their experiments. They also provide a table (Table 2) that lists these datasets along with their properties.

I will carefully examine **Table 2** to extract the names and descriptions of each dataset. The table includes the following datasets:

1. **Abalone**: A dataset for regression tasks.
2. **Adult**: A dataset for binary classification tasks (income estimation).
3. **Buddy**: A dataset from Kaggle.
4. **California Housing**: A dataset for regression tasks related to real estate.
5. **Cardiovascular Disease**: A dataset for binary classification tasks.
6. **Churn Modelling**: A dataset for binary classification tasks.
7. **Diabetes**: A dataset for regression tasks.
8. **Facebook Comments Volume**: A dataset for binary classification tasks.
9. **Gesture Phase**: A dataset for binary classification tasks.
10. **Higgs Small**: A dataset for binary classification tasks related to simulated physical particles.
11. **House 16H**: A dataset for regression tasks.
12. **Insurance**: A dataset for regression tasks.
13. **King**: A dataset for regression tasks.
14. **MiniBooNE**: A dataset for regression tasks.
15. **Wilt**: A dataset for regression tasks.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations may be included in the context of the datasets or in the references for the papers that introduced them. For example, the citation for the **Adult dataset** is attributed to Kohavi (1996), and the citation for the **California Housing dataset** is attributed to Kelley Pace & Barry (1997).

After gathering the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
