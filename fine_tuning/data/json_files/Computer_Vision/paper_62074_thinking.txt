To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SplatFlow: Learning Multi-frame Optical Flow via Splatting" by Bo Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the performance of the proposed method on the **KITTI2015** and **Sintel** benchmarks, indicating that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention several datasets:

1. **FlyingChairs Dataset**: This is a synthetic dataset consisting of moving 2D chair images superimposed on natural backgrounds. The authors note that it has 22,232 training pairs and 640 testing pairs, but it cannot be used for multi-frame training due to the lack of temporal links.

2. **FlyingThings3D Dataset**: This dataset is generated using a large pool of rendering assets and contains 2,239 training sequences and 437 testing sequences, with each sequence providing multiple two-frame image pairs. The authors mention that they constructed a multi-frame dataset from this dataset.

3. **Sintel Dataset**: Derived from a 3D animated short film, this dataset contains 23 training sequences and 12 testing sequences, with ground truth available for most frames. The authors indicate that they created a multi-frame training dataset from this dataset as well.

4. **KITTI2015 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 400 dynamic scenes annotated with detailed 3D CAD models for all vehicles in motion. The authors mention using this dataset for both training and testing.

5. **HD1K Dataset**: This dataset includes various challenging lighting and weather conditions and contains 36 sequences. The authors note that they can build both two-frame and multi-frame datasets from it.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
