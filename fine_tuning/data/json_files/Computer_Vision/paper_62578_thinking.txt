To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DIAGNOSIS: Detecting Unauthorized Data Usages in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models" by Zhenting Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on "four datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in **section 4 (Evaluation)**, where they mention using four datasets: **Pokemon**, **CelebA**, **CUB-200**, and **Dog**. 

I will then gather detailed descriptions of each dataset from the **appendix** section, specifically **A.2**, which provides information about the datasets used in the experiments:

1. **Pokemon Dataset**: Contains 833 high-quality images of PokÃ©mon, each with a corresponding text caption generated by the BLIP model.
   
2. **CelebA Dataset**: This dataset consists of face images of various celebrities, with 1000 images randomly sampled from the original CelebA dataset, each having a caption generated by the LLaVA model.

3. **CUB-200 Dataset**: Comprises 5994 training images and 5794 testing images belonging to 200 bird species, with each image accompanied by 10 text descriptions.

4. **Dog Dataset**: Contains 5180 dog images used for training signal classifiers, sourced from the Cat-Dog-Bird dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
