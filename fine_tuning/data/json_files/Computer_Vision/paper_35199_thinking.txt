To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DialogWAE: Multimodal Response Generation with Conditional Wasserstein Auto-Encoder" by Xiaodong Gu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that they evaluate their model on "two popular datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used in their experiments. I will note this and look for specific names in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets: **SwitchBoard** and **DailyDialog**. I will take note of the details provided about each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they are used.

1. **SwitchBoard**: The authors describe it as containing 2,400 two-way telephone conversations under 70 specified topics. This dataset is widely recognized in dialogue research.

2. **DailyDialog**: This dataset consists of 13,118 daily conversations aimed at English learners, which is also a well-known resource in the field.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

- For **SwitchBoard**, the citation is:
  > John J. Godfrey and Edward Holliman. *Switchboard-1 Release 2*. Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia, 1997.

- For **DailyDialog**, the citation is:
  > Yanran Li, Hui Su, Xiaoyu Shen, Wenjie Li, Ziqiang Cao, and Shuzi Niu. *DailyDialog: A Manually Labelled Multi-turn Dialogue Dataset*. In Proceedings of the Eighth International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 986â€“995, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the extracted information is organized and ready for further use or analysis.
