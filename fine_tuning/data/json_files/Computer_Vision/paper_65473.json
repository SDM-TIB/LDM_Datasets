The dataset encompasses a total of 3779 axial contrast-enhanced abdominal CT images, with voxel spatial resolutions ranging from ([0.54-0.54] × [0.98-0.98] × [2.5-5.0]) mm³. It aims to facilitate the segmentation of eight anatomical structures, including the aorta, gallbladder, left kidney, right kidney, liver, pancreas, spleen, and stomach.",
