To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data driven approximation of parametrized PDEs by Reduced Basis and Neural Networks" by Niccol√≤ Dal Santo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for training or validation.

Next, I will look for sections that explicitly discuss datasets, such as **numerical experiments or results sections**. These sections often detail the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and how they were generated or collected.

In the **numerical experiments section**, the authors describe the use of snapshots collected from solving the problem with the finite element method (FEM) for various parameter values. They mention that they collected **ns = 19137 snapshots** for the velocity, which will be important to note.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to datasets or methodologies that may have used specific datasets. This could provide additional context or full citations for datasets that are foundational to the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will ensure to write down the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. For instance, if the authors refer to a specific dataset or methodology that has been previously published, I will include that citation.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described, including its name, purpose, and citation.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Examine the methodology and numerical experiments sections for detailed descriptions of datasets.
3. Check the references for any relevant citations related to datasets.
4. Document the datasets with full citations for each identified dataset.
