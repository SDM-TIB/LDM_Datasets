To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Class-Specific Variational Auto-Encoder for Content-Based Image Retrieval" by Mehdi Rafiei and Alexandros Iosifidis, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method is evaluated on three public and one custom dataset, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **Fashion MNIST**: This dataset consists of 70,000 fashion-related gray-scale images, categorized into 10 classes, with 60,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing.

2. **Cifar-10**: This dataset contains 60,000 RGB-color images across 10 classes, with 50,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing.

3. **Yale**: This dataset includes 165 gray-scale facial images of 15 subjects, with images taken under various lighting and expressions.

4. **X-ray Dataset**: A custom dataset containing 271 gray-scale images of fibrous products, categorized into four classes, with the non-defective class being the focus for the experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Fashion MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Xiao, H., Rasul, K., & Vollgraf, R. (2017). *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747.

- For **Cifar-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical Report, Toronto, ON, Canada.

- For **Yale**, the citation is:
  > Belhumeur, P. N., Hespanha, J. P., & Kriegman, D. J. (1996). *Eigenfaces vs. fisherfaces: Recognition using class specific linear projection*. European Conference on Computer Vision, 19(7), 43-58.

- For the **X-ray dataset**, since it is a custom dataset, it may not have a formal citation. However, I will note its description as provided in the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
