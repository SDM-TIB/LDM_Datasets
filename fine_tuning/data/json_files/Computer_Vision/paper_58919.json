        "dcterms:description": "The ogbg-molhiv dataset contains 41,127 graphs. Each graph represents a molecule, where nodes are atoms, and edges are chemical bonds. The input node features are 9-dimensional, containing atomic number, chirality, etc. The edge features are 3-dimensional, representing bond type, bond stereochemistry, and conjugation, respectively. The task associated with this dataset is to predict whether a target molecule inhibits HIV virus replication or not, which is a binary classification task.",
