To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Super Interaction Neural Networks" by Yang Yao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed model on benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) to identify any specific datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention that they evaluate their model on the **ImageNet** dataset and the **CIFAR-100** dataset. This is a clear indication that these datasets are central to their experiments.

I will then look for detailed descriptions of these datasets within the paper. The authors provide information about the **ImageNet** dataset, stating it consists of 1.28 million images for training and 50,000 images for validation across 1,000 classes. They also mention the **CIFAR-100** dataset, which contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each with a resolution of 32x32 pixels.

After gathering this information, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **ImageNet** dataset, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, and Michael Bernstein. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

- For the **CIFAR-100** dataset, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 Datasets*. 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
