To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep-Generative Hybrid Model to Integrate Multimodal and Dynamic Connectivity for Predicting Spectrum-Level Deficits in Autism" by Niharika Shimona D'Souza et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for validation. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of their research, which may include references to datasets used in previous studies or their own. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation and results section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study, including how they were collected, the number of subjects, and any preprocessing steps taken. 

In this paper, the authors mention that they validate their framework on a cohort of **57 children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)**. They describe the neuroimaging data collected, specifically mentioning **resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI)** and **diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)** scans. 

I will note the details provided about the data acquisition:
- The rs-fMRI data was acquired on a Philips 3T Achieva scanner with specific parameters (EPI, TR/TE=2500/30ms, etc.).
- The DTI data was also collected with specific parameters (EPI, SENSE factor=2.5, etc.).

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets or any related studies that may have provided the datasets. 

The authors reference the following key datasets:
1. **Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS)**: This is a standardized assessment tool for diagnosing autism spectrum disorders.
   - Citation: Payakachat, N., et al. (2012). "Autism spectrum disorders: A review of measures for clinical, health services and cost-effectiveness applications." *Expert Review of Pharmacoeconomics & Outcomes Research*, 12(4), 485-503.

2. **Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS)**: This is a questionnaire used to measure social functioning in individuals with autism.
   - Citation: Bennett, I.J., Rypma, B. (2013). "Advances in functional neuroanatomy: A review of combined DTI and fMRI studies in healthy younger and older adults." *Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews*, 37(7), 1201-1210.

3. **Praxis**: This measures the ability to perform skilled motor gestures on command.
   - Citation: Dziuk, M., et al. (2007). "Dyspraxia in autism: Association with motor, social, and communicative deficits." *Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology*, 49(10), 734-739.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as specified. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research.
