To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Logic Induced Reranking for Generative Text-to-Image Systems" by Björn Deiseroth et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of text-to-image models and mentions the "draw bench benchmark," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look for sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **experiments or evaluation sections**. In the introduction, the authors reference the use of models like DALL-E and CLIP, but I need to find specific datasets used for evaluation.

In the **Empirical Evaluation section**, the authors mention using the **MS COCO dataset** for their object counting experiments. This is a well-known dataset in the field of computer vision, particularly for object detection and image captioning tasks.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MS COCO dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Lin, T.; Maire, M.; Belongie, S. J.; Hays, J.; Perona, P.; Ramanan, D.; Dollar, P.; and Zitnick, C. L. 2014. Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context. In Computer Vision - ECCV 2014 - 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V, 740–755.

Additionally, the authors mention using the **CLEVR dataset** for fine-tuning the DETR model. I will also look for the citation for this dataset in the references. The citation is:
> Johnson, J.; Hariharan, B.; van der Maaten, L.; Fei-Fei, L.; Zitnick, C. L.; and Girshick, R. B. 2017. CLEVR: A Diagnostic Dataset for Compositional Language and Elementary Visual Reasoning. In 2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, CVPR 2017, Honolulu, HI, USA, July 21-26, 2017, 1988–1997.

Now, I have identified two datasets used in the paper: **MS COCO** and **CLEVR**. I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations for documentation.

In summary, I will document the following datasets:
1. **MS COCO Dataset**: Used for object counting experiments.
   - Citation: Lin, T.; Maire, M.; Belongie, S. J.; Hays, J.; Perona, P.; Ramanan, D.; Dollar, P.; and Zitnick, C. L. 2014. Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context. In Computer Vision - ECCV 2014 - 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V, 740–755.

2. **CLEVR Dataset**: Used for fine-tuning the DETR model.
   - Citation: Johnson, J.; Hariharan, B.; van der Maaten, L.; Fei-Fei, L.; Zitnick, C. L.; and Girshick, R. B. 2017. CLEVR: A Diagnostic Dataset for Compositional Language and Elementary Visual Reasoning. In 2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, CVPR 2017, Honolulu, HI, USA, July 21-26, 2017, 1988–1997.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
