To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating Text-to-Visual Generation with Image-to-Text Generation" by Zhiqiu Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors introduce a benchmark called **GenAI-Bench**, which suggests that there may be datasets associated with this benchmark.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. In this case, I will focus on **section 5 (GenAI-Bench)**, where the authors describe the benchmark they created. They mention that **GenAI-Bench** consists of 1,600 compositional text prompts and over 15,000 human ratings, which are crucial for evaluating text-to-visual generation models.

In addition, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The paper references several benchmarks and datasets, including:

1. **Winoground**: A benchmark for evaluating vision-language models on compositional reasoning tasks.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.
