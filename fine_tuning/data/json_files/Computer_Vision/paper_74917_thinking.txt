To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pre-Trained Vision-Language Models as Partial Annotators" by Qian-Wei Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of pre-trained models for annotating image datasets, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the application of their method to image classification tasks and mention the use of CLIP for annotating datasets. This indicates that there are datasets that have been annotated using this model.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. In **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, they list several datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.

3. **SVHN (Street View House Numbers)**: A dataset of over 600,000 digit images obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images.

4. **Fashion-MNIST**: A dataset of 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items, intended as a drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset.

5. **EuroSAT**: A dataset for land use and land cover classification, consisting of 27,000 labeled images from Sentinel-2 satellite data.

6. **FER2013**: A dataset containing facial expression images, with 35,887 labeled images across seven emotion categories.

7. **GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark)**: A dataset containing over 50,000 images of traffic signs, used for traffic sign recognition tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations to ensure that I have a complete and accurate representation of the datasets used in the research paper.
