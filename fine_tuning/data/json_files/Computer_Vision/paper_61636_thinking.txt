To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CodeTF: One-Stop Transformer Library for State-of-the-Art Code LLM" by Nghi D. Q. Bui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss datasets**. The abstract mentions that the library supports a collection of popular code benchmarks, which indicates that datasets are likely included.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the importance of code intelligence and the role of datasets in training and evaluating models. I will look for any specific dataset names mentioned.

In the **Datasets section (Section 4)**, I will carefully identify any datasets explicitly listed. The authors mention two datasets: 

1. **HumanEval**: This dataset is used for evaluating code generation models. It consists of programming problems that require generating code solutions.
2. **CodeXGLUE**: This is a benchmark dataset for various code understanding and generation tasks, which includes multiple subsets for different tasks.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

For **HumanEval**, the citation is:
> Chen, M., Tworek, J., Jun, H., Yuan, Q., Ponde de Oliveira Pinto, H., Kaplan, J., ... & Brockman, G. (2021). Evaluating large language models trained on code. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2107.03374*.

For **CodeXGLUE**, the citation is:
> Lu, S., Guo, D., Ren, S., Huang, J., Svyatkovskiy, A., Blanco, A., ... & Liu, S. (2021). Codexglue: A machine learning benchmark dataset for code understanding and generation. *In NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described clearly and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
