To extract datasets from the research paper titled "StoryGPT-V: Large Language Models as Consistent Story Visualizers" by Xiaoqian Shen and Mohamed Elhoseiny, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on "two visual story visualization benchmarks," which indicates that datasets are involved. I will note this as a starting point for my search.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In **Section 4.1 (Experimental Setups)**, they list the datasets as follows:

1. **FlintstonesSV**: This dataset contains 20,132 training stories, 2,071 validation stories, and 2,309 test stories, featuring 7 main characters and 323 backgrounds. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

2. **PororoSV**: This dataset consists of 10,191 training samples, 2,334 validation samples, and 2,208 test samples, with 9 main characters. This dataset is also essential for their experiments.

The authors also mention that they extended these datasets with referential text, which is relevant for understanding how they utilized the datasets in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **FlintstonesSV**, the citation is:
  > Tanmay Gupta, Dustin Schwenk, Ali Farhadi, Derek Hoiem, and Aniruddha Kembhavi. *Imagine this! scripts to compositions to videos*. In Proceedings of the European conference on computer vision (ECCV), pages 598–613, 2018.

- For **PororoSV**, the citation is:
  > Yanzhe Zhang, Ruiyi Zhang, Jiuxiang Gu, Yufan Zhou, Nedim Lipka, Diyi Yang, and Tong Sun. *Pororogan: An improved story visualization model on pororo-sv dataset*. In Proceedings of the 2019 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, pages 155–159, 2019.

With this information, I have successfully identified the datasets used in the paper along with their full citations. I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
