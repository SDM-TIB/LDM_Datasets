To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GecoNeRF: Few-Shot Neural Radiance Fields via Geometric Consistency" by Minseop Kwak et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method on synthetic and real datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors refer to the challenges of few-shot NeRF and mention that they demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on synthetic and real datasets. This prompts me to look for specific dataset names in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors explicitly state the datasets used for evaluation. They mention two datasets:

1. **NeRF-Synthetic**: This dataset is described as a realistically rendered 360Â° synthetic dataset comprised of 8 scenes. The authors indicate that they randomly sample 3 viewpoints out of 100 training images in each scene, with 200 testing images for evaluation.

2. **LLFF**: This dataset consists of real-life forward-facing scenes. The authors explain that they apply standard settings by selecting the test set evenly from a list of every 8th image and selecting 3 reference views from the remaining images.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. Here are the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For **NeRF-Synthetic**, the citation is:
  > Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P. Srinivasan, Rodrigo Ortiz-Cayon, Nima Khademi Kalantari, Ravi Ramamoorthi, Ren Ng, and Abhishek Kar. *Local light field fusion: Practical view synthesis with prescriptive sampling guidelines*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 2019.

- For **LLFF**, the citation is:
  > Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P. Srinivasan, Matthew Tancik, Jonathan T. Barron, Ravi Ramamoorthi, and Ren Ng. *Nerf: Representing scenes as neural radiance fields for view synthesis*. In ECCV, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
