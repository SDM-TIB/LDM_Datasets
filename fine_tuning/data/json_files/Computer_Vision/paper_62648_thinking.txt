To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Invertible Low-Dimensional Modelling of X-ray Absorption Spectra for Potential Applications in Spectral X-ray Imaging" by Raziye Kubra Kumrular and Thomas Blumensath, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly list datasets, it sets the context for what is being investigated. The introduction will likely elaborate on the motivation and background, which may include references to datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors mention various datasets in Table I, which summarizes the names and characteristics of the datasets created for their experiments. I will carefully note the names and descriptions of each dataset listed.

The datasets mentioned in the paper include:

1. **D2E**: A dataset consisting of mixtures of two elements without K-edges.
2. **D2E,0K**: A dataset of two elements without K-edges.
3. **D5E**: A dataset consisting of mixtures of five elements.
4. **D5E,0K**: A dataset of five elements without K-edges.
5. **D2E,2K**: A dataset of two elements, both having K-edges.
6. **D3E,0K**: A dataset of three elements without K-edges.
7. **D3E,1K**: A dataset of three elements with one K-edge.
8. **D3E,2K**: A dataset of three elements with two K-edges.
9. **D3E,3K**: A dataset of three elements with three K-edges.
10. **D5E,5K**: A dataset of five elements, all having K-edges.
11. **D2E,131**: A dataset generated with 131 energy levels.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. The paper cites the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) database for the linear attenuation coefficients (LAC) used in the simulations, which is relevant for understanding the datasets.

The citation for the NIST database is:
> J. H. Hubbell and S. M. Seltzer, “Tables of X-ray mass attenuation coefficients and mass energy-absorption coefficients (version 1.4),” National Institute of Standards and Technology, Githersburg, MD, USA, 2004, accessed on Jan. 2023. Available: https://www.nist.gov/pml/x-ray-mass-attenuation-coefficients

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately and comprehensively.
