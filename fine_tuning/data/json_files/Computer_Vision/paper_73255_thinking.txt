To extract datasets from the research paper titled "I2VC: A Unified Framework for Intra- & Inter-frame Video Compression" by Meiqin Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments using various compression configurations, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they state that they adopted the **Vimeo-90K Septuplet** dataset for training and utilized the **Kodak**, **JCT-VC**, and **UVG** datasets for performance evaluation. This is a clear indication that these datasets are critical to their research.

I will then look for detailed descriptions of each dataset within the paper. The authors provide some context about the datasets in the experiments section:

1. **Vimeo-90K Septuplet**: This dataset is used for training the model. It consists of video sequences that are useful for learning video compression techniques.

2. **Kodak Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of the proposed method. It is known for its high-quality images and is often used in image processing research.

3. **JCT-VC Dataset**: This dataset is part of the Joint Collaborative Team on Video Coding (JCT-VC) and is used for evaluating video compression methods. It includes various video sequences that are standard in the field.

4. **UVG Dataset**: The UVG dataset contains 4K video sequences and is used for codec analysis and development. It is also mentioned as a benchmark for performance evaluation.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **Vimeo-90K**:
  > Xue, Tianfan, et al. "Video enhancement with task-oriented flow." *International Journal of Computer Vision* 127.8 (2019): 1106-1125.

- For **Kodak Dataset**:
  > Franzen, R. "Kodak lossless true color image suite." 2013. http://r0k.us/graphics/kodak/.

- For **JCT-VC Dataset**:
  > Bossen, Frank, et al. "Common test conditions and software reference configurations." *JCTVC-L1100*, 12(7):1, 2013.

- For **UVG Dataset**:
  > Mercat, Alexandre, et al. "UVG dataset: 50/120fps 4k sequences for video codec analysis and development." In *Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on Multimedia (ACM MM)*, pages 297-302, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
