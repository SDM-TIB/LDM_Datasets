To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Creating Seamless 3D Maps Using Radiance Fields" by Sai Tarun Sathyan, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the creation of 3D object models and maps from 2D images, which suggests that datasets of 2D images are likely involved. The introduction elaborates on the use of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting techniques, indicating that a dataset of 2D images is essential for training these models.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology and experiments sections**. In the methodology, the author describes the dataset creation process, emphasizing the importance of capturing continuous images of the target scenes. The paper mentions using drone images and Google satellite views as input data for training the models. This indicates that these sources are part of the dataset.

In the **dataset creation section**, the author outlines the techniques for capturing images, including the need for overlapping images to ensure accurate 3D reconstruction. This section does not provide a formal dataset name but describes the process of dataset creation in detail.

I will also check the **results and discussion section** to see if any specific datasets are referenced or if the results are tied to particular datasets. The author mentions using over 1000 images for training the Gaussian Splatting model, but again, no formal dataset name is provided.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets used. The paper references various techniques and prior works, but it does not provide formal citations for specific datasets.

Based on my findings, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Dataset of 2D Images**: This dataset is created by capturing images using various techniques, including drone images and Google satellite views. The dataset is crucial for training the NeRF and Gaussian Splatting models.

2. **Google Satellite View**: This is specifically mentioned as a source of data for creating 3D maps, although it is not formally cited as a dataset.

3. **Drone Images**: These images are used to capture scenes for 3D reconstruction, but again, no formal citation is provided.

Since the paper does not provide formal dataset names or citations, I will note that the datasets are described in a general sense without specific references. 

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include any relevant details about the datasets, even if they lack formal citations.
