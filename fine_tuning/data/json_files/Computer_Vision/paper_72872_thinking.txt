To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLIP-Powered TASS: Target-Aware Single-Stream Network for Audio-Visual Question Answering" by Yuanyuan Jiang and Jianqin Yin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on the **MUSIC-AVQA benchmark**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they evaluated their method on the **MUSIC-AVQA dataset**, which contains 45,867 question-answer pairs distributed across 9,288 videos. This dataset is designed for studying spatio-temporal reasoning in dynamic audio-visual scenes.

I will also check the **related works and references sections** to find any additional datasets that may have been used or referenced. However, the primary focus here is on the MUSIC-AVQA dataset, as it is the main dataset utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the MUSIC-AVQA dataset from the references section. The citation is as follows:
> Li, G., Wei, Y., Tian, Y., et al. (2022). Learning to answer questions in dynamic audio-visual scenarios. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 19108â€“19118.

After compiling this information, I will prepare to create an entry for the MUSIC-AVQA dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read through the abstract and introduction to identify the main dataset.
2. Confirm the dataset's details in the experiments section.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references section.

With this information, I can now proceed to format the dataset entry appropriately.
