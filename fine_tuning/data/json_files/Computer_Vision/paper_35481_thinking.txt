To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Probabilistic Deformation Modeling for Robust Diffeomorphic Registration" by Julian Krebs et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on **330 cardiac MR sequences**, which suggests that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. Here, the authors describe using **184 short-axis datasets** from various hospitals and **150 cases from the Automatic Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC)**. This is crucial information, as it specifies the datasets used for their experiments.

In the **implementation details**, the authors mention that they used **234 cases for training** and **100 cases for testing** from the ACDC dataset, which further confirms the importance of this dataset in their work.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **ACDC dataset**, the citation is:
   > Bernard, O., et al. *Deep Learning Techniques for Automatic MRI Cardiac Segmentation and Diagnosis: A Review*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), 2018.

2. The **short-axis datasets** are not attributed to a specific citation in the paper, but they are mentioned as being acquired from different hospitals. If no specific citation is provided, I will note that this dataset is a collection of clinical data without a formal reference.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Cardiac MR Sequences**: A dataset consisting of 330 cardiac MR sequences used for evaluating the proposed registration method.
- **ACDC Dataset**: A dataset containing 150 cases from the Automatic Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge, which includes segmentation and disease label information for five cardiac diseases.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the full citation where applicable, and prepare them for structured output. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
