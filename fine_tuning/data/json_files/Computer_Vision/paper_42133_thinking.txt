To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Crowd Scene Analysis by Output Encoding" by Yao Xue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across four mainstream datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** or **Experiments** section, as these sections typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. In this paper, the **Experiments** section (specifically section IV) summarizes the evaluation benchmarks and provides a table with basic information about the datasets.

Upon reviewing the table in section IV, I identify the following datasets:

1. **ShanghaiTech-A Dataset**: This dataset consists of 482 images with an average crowd count of 501. It is referenced in the paper as a benchmark for crowd counting.

2. **ShanghaiTech-B Dataset**: This dataset contains 716 images with an average crowd count of 123. It is also mentioned as a benchmark for crowd counting.

3. **WorldExpo Dataset**: This dataset includes 3,980 images with an average crowd count of 56. It is used for evaluating the proposed method.

4. **UCF-QNRF Dataset**: This is noted as the newest and largest crowd counting and localization dataset, comprising 1,535 high-resolution images with over 1.25 million annotated heads.

Next, I will check the **References** section to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **ShanghaiTech-A Dataset**:

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, ensuring that I have accurately captured all relevant details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
