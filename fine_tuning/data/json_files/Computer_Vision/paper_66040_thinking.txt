To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion-based Radiotherapy Dose Prediction Guided by Inter-slice Aware Structure Encoding" by Zhenghao Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I accurately identify and cite the datasets used in the study.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to find any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions an "in-house dataset involving 130 rectum cancer cases," which indicates that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions in the **experiments section**. Here, the authors provide a comprehensive description of the dataset: it consists of CT images, PTV masks, OAR masks, and clinically planned dose distributions from 130 rectum cancer patients who received VMAT treatment. This section also specifies that the dataset includes demographic information (87 male and 43 female patients) and details about the treatment process.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, since the dataset is described as an "in-house dataset," it may not have a formal citation in the references. Instead, I will note that the dataset is unique to this study and does not have an external citation.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **In-house Dataset**: This dataset includes CT images, PTV masks, OAR masks, and clinically planned dose distributions from 130 rectum cancer patients treated at West China Hospital. The dataset is specifically designed for evaluating the proposed method in the context of radiotherapy dose prediction.

Since this dataset does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is an in-house dataset created for the study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I highlight the unique aspects of the dataset and its relevance to the research conducted in the paper.
