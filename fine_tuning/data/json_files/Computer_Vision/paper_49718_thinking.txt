To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Airplane Type Identification Based on Mask RCNN and Drone Images" by W.T. Alshaibani et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, as it often contains detailed information about the datasets employed in the research. In this paper, the authors mention that the dataset was built using images captured by two eBee classic drones flying over Le Bourget airport in Paris. This indicates that the dataset is likely composed of drone images of airplanes.

I will then look for any specific names or references to datasets within the text. The authors may describe the dataset's characteristics, such as the number of images, types of airplanes included, and any specific annotations or labels used for training the model.

In the **results section**, I will check if the authors discuss the performance of their model on specific datasets or if they provide any quantitative results that reference the dataset used. This can help confirm the dataset's relevance and application in their experiments.

After gathering information about the dataset, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to include their citations as well.

For this paper, the key dataset extracted is:

1. **Drone Images Dataset**: This dataset consists of images captured by eBee classic drones over Le Bourget airport, specifically designed for airplane detection and identification tasks.

The citation for the dataset is:
> W.T. Alshaibani, Mustafa Helvaci, Ibraheem Shayea, Sawsan A. Saad, Azizul Azizan, and Fitri Yakub. "Airplane Detection Based on Mask Region Convolution Neural Network." *IEEE Access*, 2021.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing or review.
