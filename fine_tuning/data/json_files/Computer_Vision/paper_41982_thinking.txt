To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TED: A Pretrained Unsupervised Summarization Model with Theme Modeling and Denoising" by Ziyi Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that TED outperforms unsupervised abstractive baselines on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly state the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention three benchmark summarization datasets:

1. **NYT Dataset**: This dataset contains 110,000 news articles. The authors specify that they filter examples with summaries of fewer than 50 words for their experiments.

2. **CNN/DM Dataset**: This dataset consists of 300,000 news articles. The authors note that input articles are truncated to 500 tokens for their evaluation.

3. **English Gigaword Dataset**: This dataset includes 3.8 million news articles. The authors mention filtering out data examples with articles containing only "UNK" tokens.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. However, the datasets themselves may not have specific citations listed in the references, as they are commonly used benchmark datasets in the field of summarization. Therefore, I will provide the standard citations for these datasets based on common knowledge:

- For the **NYT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Abigail See, Peter J Liu, and Christopher D Manning. *Get to the point: Summarization with pointer-generator networks*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1073–1083, 2017.

- For the **CNN/DM Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Abigail See, Peter J Liu, and Christopher D Manning. *Get to the point: Summarization with pointer-generator networks*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1073–1083, 2017.

- For the **English Gigaword Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Graff, C., & Cieri, C. *English Gigaword, Fifth Edition*. Linguistic Data Consortium, 2007.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
