To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TADA: Text to Animatable Digital Avatars" by Tingting Liao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that TADA generates 3D avatars from text descriptions, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in training or evaluating the model. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in these sections.

Next, I will move to the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these often contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. I will pay particular attention to any sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets," "Training Data," or "Evaluation Data." 

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, types of data (e.g., images, videos), and any specific characteristics that are highlighted.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. 

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like "TalkSHOW" for animation, I will look for the full citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Yi, H., Liang, H., Liu, Y., Cao, Q., Wen, Y., Bolkart, T., & Black, M. J. (2023). Generating holistic 3D human motion from speech. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

If the paper references datasets that are well-known, such as "SMPL-X," I will ensure to provide the original citation for that dataset as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will format the extracted information clearly and concisely, ready for any further processing or review.
