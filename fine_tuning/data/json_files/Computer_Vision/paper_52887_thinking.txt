To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Filter-based Discriminative Autoencoders for Children Speech Recognition" by Chiang-Lin Tai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the proposed method on the **CMU Kids corpus** and the **PF-STAR corpus**, indicating that these are the primary datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experimental settings section** to gather more detailed information about these datasets. In this section, the authors provide specifics about the **CMU Kids corpus (LDC97S631)**, which contains 9.1 hours of speech from 151 children aged 6 to 11 years. The training set consists of 6.34 hours of speech from 76 kids, while the test set includes 2.75 hours from 75 different kids. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's composition.

The authors also mention the **WSJ corpus** as the adult speech corpus used in conjunction with the children’s speech corpus. The WSJ corpus has a training set of 81.48 hours of speech from 283 adults, with two test sets (eval92 and dev93) containing 0.7 hours and 1.08 hours of speech, respectively.

Additionally, the **PF-STAR corpus** is described as containing 14.2 hours of speech from 152 British children aged 4 to 14 years, with a training set of 8.4 hours from 92 kids and a test set of 5.82 hours from 60 kids. This dataset is also used in the experiments, particularly for domain adaptation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

2. **PF-STAR corpus**:

3. **WSJ corpus**:
   > P. Godfrey, D. Holliman, and J. McDaniel. *SWITCHBOARD: Telephone speech corpus for research and development*. Linguistic Data Consortium, 1992.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for further processing.
