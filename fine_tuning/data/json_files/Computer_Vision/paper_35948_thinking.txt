To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PointCNN: Convolution On X-Transformed Points" by Yangyan Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "multiple challenging benchmark datasets and tasks," which suggests that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention evaluating PointCNN on several datasets for both classification and segmentation tasks. 

I will identify the datasets mentioned:

1. **ModelNet40**: This dataset consists of 12,311 3D mesh models from 40 categories, with a training/testing split of 9,843/2,468. The authors note that the models are mostly pre-aligned, which is important for understanding the dataset's structure.

2. **ShapeNet Parts**: This dataset contains 16,880 models from 16 shape categories, annotated with parts. The training/testing split is 14,006/2,874, and the task involves predicting part labels for each point.

3. **S3DIS**: This dataset includes 3D scans from indoor environments, with 271 rooms and annotations for 13 semantic categories. The authors describe how the data is processed for segmentation tasks.

4. **ScanNet**: This dataset consists of 1,513 scanned indoor scenes, with a training/testing split of 1,201/312. It is used for semantic voxel labeling across 17 categories.

5. **TU-Berlin**: A dataset for sketch classification, containing sketches from 250 categories, with 80 sketches per category.

6. **Quick Draw**: This is a large sketch dataset with sketches from 345 categories, each containing 70,000 training samples and 2,500 testing samples.

7. **MNIST**: The authors also evaluate PointCNN on the point cloud representation of the MNIST dataset, which is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit classification.

8. **CIFAR10**: Similar to MNIST, PointCNN is evaluated on the point cloud representation of the CIFAR10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
