To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Consistency2: Consistent and Fast 3D Painting with Latent Consistency Models" by Tianfu Wang, Anton Obukhov, and Konrad Schindler, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **Objaverse dataset** for evaluating their 3D painting method, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the **Objaverse dataset** in the **experiments section**. Here, the authors state that they evaluated their method using a subset of the Objaverse evaluation meshes, totaling 343 meshes in 203 categories. This confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use.

I will also check the **related work section** and **references** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or cited. The references include a citation for the Objaverse dataset, which is essential for providing a complete citation.

The full citation for the **Objaverse dataset** is:
> Matt Deitke, Dustin Schwenk, Jordi Salvador, Luca Weihs, Oscar Michel, Eli VanderBilt, Ludwig Schmidt, Kiana Ehsani, Aniruddha Kembhavi, and Ali Farhadi. *Objaverse: A universe of annotated 3D objects*. In CVPR, 2023.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the Objaverse dataset, I will ensure to document this dataset thoroughly.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will be done in a structured format for clarity and completeness.

After gathering all necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
