To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ShiftDDPMs: Exploring Conditional Diffusion Models" by Zijian Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method on various image synthesis tasks, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors conduct experiments on several datasets, which are likely to be detailed in the **experiments** section. 

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention using the following datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluating the performance of the proposed method on conditional image generation tasks. It consists of handwritten digits and is a standard benchmark in the field of machine learning.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for evaluating the performance of the proposed method on more complex image synthesis tasks. CIFAR-10 contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.

3. **LFW Dataset (Labeled Faces in the Wild)**: This dataset is used for experiments related to facial image generation based on attributes. It contains images of faces collected from the web, with labels indicating the identity of the individuals.

4. **CelebA-HQ Dataset**: This dataset is employed for image inpainting tasks. It contains high-quality images of celebrity faces, which are useful for evaluating the inpainting capabilities of the proposed method.

5. **Places2 Dataset**: This dataset is also used for image inpainting experiments. It consists of a large number of images from various scenes, providing a diverse set of backgrounds for testing the inpainting model.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
