To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Cycle-Consistent Adversarial GAN: the integration of adversarial attack and defense" by Lingyun Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that they applied their method on two public datasets: **MNIST** and **CIFAR10**. This indicates that these datasets are relevant for the research.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors mention that they trained different models on **MNIST** and **CIFAR10** and provide some context about their use in the experiments. 

In the **implementation section**, the authors provide specific references to the datasets:
- **MNIST**: This dataset is widely known for handwritten digit recognition and consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9).
- **CIFAR10**: This dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proc. IEEE, vol. 86, no. 11, pp. 2278–2324, Nov. 1998.

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets and their citations. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
