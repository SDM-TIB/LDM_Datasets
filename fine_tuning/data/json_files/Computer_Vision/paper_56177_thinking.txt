To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Anomaly Detection via Federated Learning" by Marc Vucovich et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets utilized in their experiments. This section is likely to contain detailed information about each dataset, including their characteristics and the specific features they contain.

In section IV, the authors mention four datasets:

1. **CIC-IDS2017 Dataset**: This dataset contains labeled network activity data for benign and malicious behavior, broken into 5 CSV files with 80 features each. The attacks included are various types such as DoS and DDoS.

2. **CIC-IDS2018 Dataset**: Similar to the CIC-IDS2017, this dataset is broken into 10 CSV files and contains 80 features captured from network traffic and system logs of 420 machines and 30 servers, with labels indicating benign or malicious activity.

3. **NCC-DC Dataset**: This dataset includes labeled network activity for benign and several attack types, with the same 80 features as the CIC-IDS datasets. It was created for the National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition.

4. **MAWI-Lab Dataset**: This dataset contains benign activity data with 66 features, which are a subset of the CIC-IDS/NCC-DC datasets. It includes 1,500,000 data points, primarily benign.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For the **CIC-IDS2017 Dataset**:
  > I. Sharafaldin, A. H. Lashkari, and A. A. Ghorbani. "Toward generating a new intrusion detection dataset and intrusion traffic characterization." In ICISSP, 2018.

- For the **CIC-IDS2018 Dataset**:
  > Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity. "CICIDS 2018 Dataset." [Online]. Available: https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2018.html

- For the **NCC-DC Dataset**:
  > D. Williams. [Online]. Available: https://www.nationalccdc.org/

- For the **MAWI-Lab Dataset**:
  > R. Fontugne, P. Borgnat, P. Abry, and K. Fukuda. "MAWILab: Combining Diverse Anomaly Detectors for Automated Anomaly Labeling and Performance Benchmarking." In ACM CoNEXT â€™10, Philadelphia, PA, December 2010.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
