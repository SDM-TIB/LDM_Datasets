To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DiffWA: Diffusion Models for Watermark Attack" by Xinyu Li, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on **CIFAR-10**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they trained a HiDDeN model on the **CIFAR-10 training set**. This confirms that CIFAR-10 is a dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Krizhevsky, A., Nair, V., and Hinton, G. *CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the CIFAR-10 dataset and does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered.

Now, I will create an entry for the CIFAR-10 dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing.
