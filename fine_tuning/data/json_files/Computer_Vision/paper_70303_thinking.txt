To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Noise Level Adaptive Diffusion Model for Robust Reconstruction of Accelerated MRI" by Shoujin Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the study. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on two public datasets and an in-house clinical dataset, which indicates that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 3) in detail, as it is likely to contain explicit mentions of the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors list three datasets:

1. **fastMRI Dataset**: The authors state that they randomly selected 20 samples for each contrast (T1, T1 post contrast, T2, and FLAIR) from the official validation set to form a test set of 80 samples.

2. **M4Raw Dataset**: This is described as a public low-field dataset, where 25 individuals from the test set, each with T1, T2, and FLAIR data, were used to form a test set of 75 samples in total.

3. **In-house Clinical Dataset**: The authors collected T1 and FLAIR data from 35 patients with white matter lesions using a 3T MRI Siemens scanner, with written informed consent obtained.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I need to extract are:

- For **fastMRI Dataset**:
  > Zbontar, J., Knoll, F., Sriram, A., Murrell, T., Huang, Z., Muckley, M.J., Defazio, A., Stern, R., Johnson, P., Bruno, M., et al. *fastMRI: An open dataset and benchmarks for accelerated MRI*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.08839, 2018.

- For **M4Raw Dataset**:
  > Lyu, M., Mei, L., Huang, S., Liu, S., Li, Y., Yang, K., Liu, Y., Dong, Y., Dong, L., Wu, E.X. *M4Raw: A multi-contrast, multi-repetition, multi-channel MRI k-space dataset for low-field MRI research*. Scientific Data 10(1), 264, 2023.

- For the **In-house Clinical Dataset**, since it is not a publicly available dataset, it may not have a formal citation. However, I will note that it was collected from a local hospital using a 3T MRI Siemens scanner.

Now, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference or use.
