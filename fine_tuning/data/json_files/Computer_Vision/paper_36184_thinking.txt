To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "Unsupervised 3D Reconstruction from a Single Image via Adversarial Learning" by Lingjing Wang and Yi Fang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of training deep learning models due to the imbalance between available images and 3D models, which suggests that datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.1 (Data sets and Evaluation Settings)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for testing their method. Here, they mention three benchmark datasets:

1. **ShapeNet**: This dataset is described as a large-scale organized collection of richly-annotated 3D CAD models. The authors indicate that they used a subset of ShapeNet data with rendered images from another study (3D-R2N2).

2. **PASCAL 3D**: This dataset is noted for augmenting 3D CAD models on PASCAL 2012 detection images. The authors specify that they chose a subset containing 3000 models across 4 categories, which include real-world images with complex backgrounds.

3. **SHREC 13**: This dataset consists of 20,000 human-drawn sketches categorized into 250 classes. The authors mention using all 80 sketches from the "chair category" for their experiments.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For **ShapeNet**, the citation is:
  > Angel X. Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, and Leonidas J. Guibas. *ShapeNet: An Information-Rich 3D Model Repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

- For **PASCAL 3D**, the citation is:
  > Yu Mottaghi, Roozbeh Mottaghi, and Abhinav Gupta. *Beyond PASCAL: A Benchmark for 3D Object Detection in the Wild*. In Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2014 IEEE Winter Conference on, pages 75–82, 2014.

- For **SHREC 13**, the citation is:
  > Bo Li, Yijuan Lu, and Godil. *SHREC’13 Track: Large Scale Sketch-Based 3D Shape Retrieval*. 2013.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
