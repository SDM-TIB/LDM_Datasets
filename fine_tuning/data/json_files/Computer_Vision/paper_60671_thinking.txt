To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "Polyp-SAM: Transfer SAM for Polyp Segmentation" by Yuheng Lia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to get an overview of the study's objectives and the datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on five public datasets, which is a clear indication that I need to identify these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they list five datasets:

1. **Kvasir**: This dataset consists of 1,000 polyp images collected from colonoscopy video sequences, with ground truth annotations verified by gastroenterologists. The resolution of the images varies.

2. **CVC-ClinicDB**: This dataset contains 612 images from 29 colonoscopy video sequences, with a resolution of 288×384 pixels.

3. **CVC-ColonDB**: This dataset includes 380 polyp images, manually annotated, with a resolution of 500×570 pixels.

4. **ETIS**: This dataset consists of 196 polyp images with a resolution of 966×1225 pixels.

5. **CVC-300**: This dataset includes 60 polyp images with a resolution of 500×574 pixels.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.
