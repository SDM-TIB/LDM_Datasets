To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recovering Faces from Portraits with Auxiliary Facial Attributes" by Fatemeh Shiri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a large-scale synthesized dataset for training, which indicates that there are datasets involved. The introduction further elaborates on the need for pairs of Stylized Portraits (SP) and Real Faces (RF) for training, suggesting that these datasets are crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Dataset and Preprocessing)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they mention that they obtained a large number of SP/RF training image pairs from the **CelebA dataset**. They specify that they randomly selected 110,000 real faces for training and 2,000 images for testing, which is essential information for documenting the dataset.

The authors also describe the process of synthesizing the SP images from various artistic styles, indicating that they generated 330,000 SP/RF pairs for training and 20,000 SP images for testing, which is another important dataset to note.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CelebA dataset. The citation for the CelebA dataset is as follows:
> Z. Liu, P. Luo, X. Wang, and X. Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3730â€“3738, 2015.

Additionally, I will note that the authors synthesized their own dataset of stylized portraits from a single real image, but since this dataset is not publicly available or formally cited, I will not include it in the final dataset documentation.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset in the final output. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
