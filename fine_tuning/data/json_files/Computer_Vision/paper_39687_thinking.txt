To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-to-End Multi-Channel Speech Separation" by Rongzhi Gu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the WSJ0 far-field speech separation task, which suggests that the WSJ0 dataset is used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they simulated a multi-channel reverberant version of the **Wall Street Journal (WSJ0 2-mix) corpus**. This is a crucial piece of information, as it indicates the specific dataset they utilized for their research.

In the description, the authors provide details about how the dataset was generated, including the use of a 6-element uniform circular array and the conditions under which the data was mixed. However, they do not provide a formal citation for the WSJ0 dataset in this section.

To ensure I have the correct citation, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The WSJ0 dataset is commonly referenced in the literature, and I will look for a citation that corresponds to its original source. The WSJ0 corpus is typically attributed to:

- **Wall Street Journal (WSJ0) corpus**: 
  > J. R. Hershey, Z. Chen, J. Le Roux, and S. Watanabe, “Deep clustering: Discriminative embeddings for segmentation and separation,” in 2016 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 31–35, 2016.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Wall Street Journal (WSJ0 2-mix corpus)**: This dataset was used for simulating multi-channel reverberant speech separation tasks. The authors describe the conditions under which the dataset was generated, including the use of a microphone array and specific mixing conditions.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation, ensuring that it is ready for any structured output or further processing.
