To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding and Improving Training-free Loss-based Diffusion Guidance" by Yifei Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of pretrained diffusion models and mentions "extensive applications in computer vision, reinforcement learning, and AI for science," which suggests that datasets may be involved, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention using the **CelebA-HQ dataset** for generating high-quality facial images and the **ImageNet dataset** for unconditional image generation. Both datasets are crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed methods.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **CelebA-HQ dataset**, the citation is:
> Liu, Z., Liu, Y., Yang, M., Huang, Y., & Wang, Y. (2015). *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 3730-3738.

For the **ImageNet dataset**, the citation is:
> Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L. J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 248-255.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details about each dataset, including their names, descriptions, and full citations.
