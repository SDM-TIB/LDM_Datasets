To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Energy-based Model Training for Better Calibrated Natural Language Understanding Models" by Tianxing He et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of energy-based model (EBM) training for natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 3) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. The authors mention that they fine-tune the Roberta-base model on **eight GLUE tasks**. This indicates that the GLUE benchmark is a significant dataset used in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors do not provide a detailed description of each GLUE task, but they do mention that they do not include results on STS-B because it is a regression task. The GLUE benchmark consists of several datasets, including:

1. **CoLA (Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability)**: A dataset for sentence acceptability classification.
2. **SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)**: A dataset for sentiment analysis.
3. **MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)**: A dataset for natural language inference.
4. **QNLI (Question Natural Language Inference)**: A dataset for question-answering tasks.
5. **QQP (Quora Question Pairs)**: A dataset for paraphrase identification.
6. **MRPC (Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus)**: A dataset for paraphrase identification.
7. **RTE (Recognizing Textual Entailment)**: A dataset for textual entailment.
8. **WNLI (Winograd NLI)**: A dataset for natural language inference.

I will now look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the GLUE benchmark and its constituent datasets. The GLUE benchmark is often cited as a whole, but I will also look for individual citations for the datasets mentioned.

The citation for the GLUE benchmark is:

For individual datasets, I will refer to their respective original papers:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
