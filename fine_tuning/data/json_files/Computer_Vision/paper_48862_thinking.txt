To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Voice Activity Detection for Transient Noisy Environment Based on Diffusion Nets" by Amir Ivry, Baruch Berdugo, and Israel Cohen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of voice activity detection in noisy environments and mention that they utilize a specific audio database. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find the exact details.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Database and Feature Extraction)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they adopted an audio database from a previous study, which consists of recordings from 11 different speakers reading aloud an article. They also specify that the recordings were contaminated with various types of noise, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's characteristics.

The authors provide details about the dataset, including:
- The number of speakers (11).
- The nature of the recordings (clean speech mixed with stationary and non-stationary noises).
- The types of noise included (e.g., keyboard taps, door knocks, etc.).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors refer to a previous study by Dov et al. (2014) for the audio database, which is essential for proper citation.

The citation for the dataset is:
> D. Dov and I. Cohen, “Voice activity detection in presence of transients using the scattering transform,” in Proc. 28th Convention of the Electrical & Electronics Engineers in Israel (IEEEI), IEEE, 2014, pp. 1–5.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset details, including the full citation, ensuring that I accurately represent the dataset's characteristics and its source.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited.
