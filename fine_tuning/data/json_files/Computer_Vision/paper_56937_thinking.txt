To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Denoising Diffusion Models for Out-of-Distribution Detection" by Mark S. Graham et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the validation of the proposed method on standard computer vision datasets and higher-dimensional medical datasets, indicating that datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors mention the importance of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and refer to various datasets used for evaluation, but I need to look for specific names and details in subsequent sections.

I will then focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. The paper mentions the following datasets:

1. **Fashion-MNIST**: A dataset of clothing images used as an in-distribution dataset.
2. **CIFAR10**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, also used as an in-distribution dataset.
3. **CelebA**: A large-scale face attributes dataset with over 200,000 celebrity images, used as an in-distribution dataset.
4. **SVHN**: The Street View House Numbers dataset, used as an out-of-distribution dataset.
5. **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits, used as an out-of-distribution dataset for Fashion-MNIST.
6. **MedNIST**: A dataset consisting of medical images from various modalities, used for higher-dimensional evaluations.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics for these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are as follows:

- **MedNIST**:
  > A dataset consisting of medical images from various modalities, specific citation details may need to be looked up as they are not provided in the paper.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
