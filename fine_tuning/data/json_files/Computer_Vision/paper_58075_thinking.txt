To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RangeSeg: Efficient Lidar Semantic Segmentation on Range view" by Ji-Chao Jiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive evaluations on publicly available datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be listed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention the use of "publicly available datasets, including SemanticKITTI, SemanticPOSS, and nuScenes." This gives me the names of the datasets I need to extract.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of these datasets in the **experiments section** to gather more details about each dataset, such as their characteristics and how they were used in the experiments. The authors have likely provided specific details about the datasets, including their sizes, types, and any relevant annotations.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The citations I will look for are:

1. **SemanticKITTI**: I will find the citation for the paper that introduced this dataset, which is likely to be:
   > J. Behley, M. Garbade, A. Milioto, J. Quenzel, S. Behnke, C. Stachniss, and J. Gall. "SemanticKITTI: A dataset for semantic scene understanding of lidar sequences." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, 2019, pp. 9297–9307.

2. **SemanticPOSS**: I will locate the citation for this dataset, which should be:
   > Y. Pan, B. Gao, J. Mei, S. Geng, C. Li, and H. Zhao. "SemanticPOSS: A point cloud dataset with large quantity of dynamic instances." In 2020 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), 2020, pp. 687–693.

3. **nuScenes**: The citation for this dataset is likely to be:
   > H. Caesar, V. Bankiti, A. H. Lang, S. Vora, V. E. Liong, Q. Xu, A. Krishnan, Y. Pan, G. Baldan, and O. Beijbom. "nuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving." arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.11027, 2019.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and provided proper citations for each.
