To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AR-DAE: Towards Unbiased Neural Entropy Gradient Estimation" by Jae Hyun Lim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the proposed method in various applications, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is where datasets are typically described. I will look for any mentions of datasets used for experiments, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the study.

Upon reviewing the experiments section, I find that the authors mention using several datasets:

1. **Dynamically Binarized MNIST**: This dataset is a variant of the MNIST dataset, which has been modified for the experiments. The authors use it to evaluate their method's performance in the context of variational autoencoders.

2. **Statically Binarized MNIST**: Another variant of the MNIST dataset, this dataset is used to assess the performance of the proposed method in a different setting.

3. **Mixture of Gaussians (MoG)**: The authors also use a synthetic dataset consisting of a mixture of Gaussian distributions to analyze the approximation error of their method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The MNIST dataset is widely known, and its citation is as follows:

- **MNIST Dataset**:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

For the Mixture of Gaussians, since it is a synthetic dataset created for the purpose of the experiments, it may not have a formal citation. However, I can note that it is a common benchmark in the literature.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for clarity and completeness.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Dynamically Binarized MNIST**:
   - Citation: Same as MNIST dataset.

2. **Statically Binarized MNIST**:
   - Citation: Same as MNIST dataset.

3. **Mixture of Gaussians**:
   - Citation: Not applicable (synthetic dataset).

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately identified and documented the datasets used in the research paper, along with their citations where applicable.
