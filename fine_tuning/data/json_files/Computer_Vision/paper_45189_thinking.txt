To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Topic Diffusion Discovery Based on Deep Non-negative Autoencoder" by Sheng-Tai Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a novel technique for monitoring topic diffusion, but it does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will look deeper into the introduction and experimental sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of identifying novel research areas and the use of topic modeling algorithms, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned. 

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiment and Discussion)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they state that they collected **31,904 open-access full-text articles related to Machine Learning from arXiv.org** for their experiments. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

The authors also mention that they created an **ML-related dictionary with 17,240 terms/words** extracted from the articles. While this is not a dataset in the traditional sense, it is an important component of their methodology.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset used. The dataset is derived from arXiv.org, so I will cite it accordingly:

- For the dataset of articles from arXiv.org, the citation is:
  > "arXiv.org e-Print archive." https://arxiv.org/.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: arXiv Machine Learning Articles
   - **Description**: A collection of 31,904 open-access full-text articles related to Machine Learning published between January 2007 and December 2019.
   - **Citation**: "arXiv.org e-Print archive." https://arxiv.org/.

With this information compiled, I am ready to format the dataset entry according to the required structure for further processing or review.
