To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Unified Diffusion Framework for Scene-aware Human Motion Estimation from Sparse Signals" by Jiangnan Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the study. In this case, the authors mention the importance of leveraging large-scale motion capture data, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Experiment Setup)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, I will look for explicit mentions of dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their contents or characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **CIRCLE Dataset**: This dataset contains 10 hours of full-body motion in 9 diverse scenes, paired with egocentric information of the environment. It is created by integrating real-world motion capture sequences into a high-quality artist-created virtual environment.

2. **GIMO Dataset**: This dataset consists of body pose sequences, scene scans, and eye gaze information. It is collected using Hololens and IMU-based motion capture suits for motion acquisition, along with an iPhone 12 for scene scanning.

Next, I will verify the details of these datasets in the **References section** to ensure I can provide full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **CIRCLE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jo˜ao Pedro Ara´ujo, Jiaman Li, Karthik Vetrivel, Rishi Agarwal, Jiajun Wu, Deepak Gopinath, Alexander William Clegg, and Karen Liu. *Circle: Capture in rich contextual environments*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 21211–21221, 2023.

- For the **GIMO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yang Zheng, Yanchao Yang, Kaichun Mo, Jiaman Li, Tao Yu, Yebin Liu, C Karen Liu, and Leonidas J Guibas. *GIMO: Gaze-informed human motion prediction in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 676–694. Springer, 2022.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
