To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CRF-CNN: Modeling Structured Information in Human Pose Estimation" by Xiao Chu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the effectiveness of the proposed CRF-CNN framework is demonstrated through experiments on two benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) to identify the specific datasets used. In this section, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **LSP Dataset**: The authors describe it as containing 2,000 images, with 1,000 images for training and 1,000 for testing. Each person in the dataset is annotated with 14 joints.

2. **FLIC Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as containing 3,987 training images and 1,016 testing images from Hollywood movies, specifically annotated for the upper body.

To confirm the details of these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **LSP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Johnson, S., & Everingham, M. (2010). Clustered pose and nonlinear appearance models for human pose estimation. In Proceedings of the British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC).

- For the **FLIC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sapp, B., & Taskar, B. (2013). MODEC: Multimodal decomposable models for human pose estimation. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will include the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and the full citations as required.
