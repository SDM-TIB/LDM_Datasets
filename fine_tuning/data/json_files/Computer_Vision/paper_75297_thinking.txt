To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3D Gaussian Ray Tracing: Fast Tracing of Particle Scenes" by Nicolas Moenne-Loccoz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. These sections often provide a high-level overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or comparison. In the introduction, the authors discuss their method's performance on various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their approach on several standard benchmarks, specifically referring to datasets like **MipNeRF360**, **Tanks & Temples**, and **Deep Blending**. I will note down these datasets and any relevant details provided about them.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide quantitative results for their method on these datasets, which confirms their use. I will extract the specific names of the datasets and any additional information such as the number of scenes or types of scenes included in each dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For example, the citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

- **MipNeRF360**:
  > Jonathan T. Barron, Ben Mildenhall, Matthew Tancik, Peter Hedman, Ricardo Martin-Brualla, and Pratul P. Srinivasan. *Mip-NeRF 360: Unbounded Anti-Aliased Neural Radiance Fields*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2022.

- **Tanks & Temples**:
  > Zhiwen Fan, Kevin Wang, Kairun Wen, Zehao Zhu, Dejia Xu, and Zhangyang Wang. *LightGaussian: Unbounded 3D Gaussian Compression with 15x Reduction and 200+ FPS*. arXiv:2311.17245, 2023.

- **Deep Blending**:
  > Thomas MÃ¼ller, Alex Evans, Christoph Schied, and Alexander Keller. *Instant Neural Graphics Primitives with a Multiresolution Hash Encoding*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 41(4), 2022.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format that clearly presents the information for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included for reference.
