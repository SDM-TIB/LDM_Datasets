To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A text-based, generative deep learning model for soil reflectance spectrum simulation in the VIS-NIR (400-2499 nm) bands" by Tong Lei and Brian N. Bailey, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the model was trained on an extensive dataset comprising nearly 180,000 soil spectra-property set pairs from 17 published datasets, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Datasets and models)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for training the model. They mention that 17 dry soil VIS-NIR or NIR spectral datasets were utilized, and they provide a table (Table 1) that lists these datasets along with their details.

In Table 1, I will extract the names of the datasets, the number of spectra in each dataset, and the selected wavelength ranges. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **LUCAS**: 62,596 spectra, wavelength range 400-2499 nm.
2. **ASSL**: 19,323 spectra, wavelength range 400-2499 nm.
3. **BRC**: 1,100 spectra, wavelength range 450-2499 nm.
4. **SER**: 108 spectra, wavelength range 400-2499 nm.
5. **OSSL**: 23,847 spectra, wavelength range 400-2499 nm.
6. **UKC**: 105 spectra, wavelength range 400-2499 nm.
7. **BSSL**: 16,094 spectra, wavelength range 400-2499 nm.
8. **BASE**: 695 spectra, wavelength range 400-2499 nm.
9. **KEW**: 553 spectra, wavelength range 850-2499 nm.
10. **OSSLJ**: 48,503 spectra, wavelength range 950-2499 nm.
11. **AFSIS**: 1,907 spectra, wavelength range 850-2499 nm.
12. **BEL**: 83 spectra, wavelength range 400-2449 nm.
13. **BRT**: 102 spectra, wavelength range 450-2149 nm.
14. **FRT**: 1,415 spectra, wavelength range 400-2499 nm.
15. **ITR**: 300 spectra, wavelength range 400-2499 nm.
16. **DAE**: 26 spectra, wavelength range 1350-2499 nm.
17. **GER1**: 362 spectra, wavelength range 400-2199 nm.
18. **GER2**: 362 spectra, wavelength range 400-2199 nm.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that these datasets were acquired from various sources, and I will need to identify the specific references for each dataset listed in Table 1.

For example, the citation for the **LUCAS dataset** is:
> Gergely Toth et al. "LUCAS Topsoil Survey-methodology, data and results." 2013.

The citation for the **BSSL dataset** is:
> Jos´e AM Demattˆe et al. "The Brazilian Soil Spectral Library (VIS-NIR-SWIR- MIR) Database: Open Access, July 2023."

I will continue this process for each dataset, ensuring that I accurately capture the full citation as it appears in the references.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format that can be used for further analysis or reference. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the study, along with their proper citations for academic integrity.
