To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HiGen: Hierarchy-Aware Sequence Generation for Hierarchical Text Classification" by Vidit Jain et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a new dataset called **ENZYME**, which is specifically designed for hierarchical text classification (HTC) and consists of articles from PubMed. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **ENZYME Dataset**: This dataset contains 30,523 full-text biomedical articles from PubMed, annotated with Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers. It features a hierarchical structure with four levels.

2. **Web-of-Science (WOS)**: This dataset is referenced as a benchmark dataset for hierarchical text classification, but specific details about its size or structure are not provided in the same section.

3. **New York Times (NYT)**: Similar to WOS, this dataset is mentioned as another benchmark dataset used for evaluation, but again, specific details are not elaborated upon.

To ensure I have the full citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations I need to find are:

- For the **ENZYME dataset**, the authors reference the BRENDA database, which is a key resource for enzyme classification. The citation for the BRENDA database is:
  > Chang, A., Jeske, L., Ulbrich, S., Hofmann, J., Koblitz, I., Schomburg, D., Neumann-Schaal, M., Jahn, D., & Schomburg, D. (2021). BRENDA, the elixir core data resource in 2021: new developments and updates. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 49(D1), D498–D508.

- For the **WOS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kowsari, K., Brown, D. E., Heidarysafa, M., Jafari Meimandi, K., Gerber, M. S., & Barnes, L. E. (2017). Hdltex: Hierarchical deep learning for text classification. In *2017 16th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA)*, pages 364–371.

- For the **NYT dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sandhaus, E. (2008). The New York Times Annotated Corpus. *Linguistic Data Consortium*, Philadelphia, 6(12), e26752.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation.
