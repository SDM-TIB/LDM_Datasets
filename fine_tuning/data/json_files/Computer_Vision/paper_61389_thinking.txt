To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differentially Private Synthetic Data via Foundation Model APIs 1: Images" by Zinan Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions generating differentially private synthetic data and references specific datasets used for evaluation, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they mention using the **CIFAR10 dataset** and the **Camelyon17 dataset** for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and any specific configurations used in the experiments.

1. **CIFAR10 Dataset**: The authors state that they treat CIFAR10 as private data for their experiments. CIFAR10 is a well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

2. **Camelyon17 Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 302,436 images of histological lymph node sections, which are used for classification tasks related to breast cancer metastases. The authors mention that they achieve a classification accuracy of 80.33% using this dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. 

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **Camelyon17**, the citation is:
  > Peter Bandi, Oscar Geessink, Quirine Manson, et al. *From Detection of Individual Metastases to Classification of Lymph Node Status at the Patient Level: The Camelyon17 Challenge*. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 38(2):550â€“560, 2018.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
