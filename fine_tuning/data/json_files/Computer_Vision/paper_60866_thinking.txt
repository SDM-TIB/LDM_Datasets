To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CaseEncoder: A Knowledge-enhanced Pre-trained Model for Legal Case Encoding" by Yixiao Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on multiple benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of legal case retrieval and mentions attempts to apply pre-trained language models in the legal domain, hinting at the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In **Section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, the authors explicitly list three datasets: **LeCaRD**, **CAIL2021-LCR**, and **CAIL2022-LCR**. I will take note of these datasets and look for detailed descriptions or references to their origins.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the experiments.

1. **LeCaRD**: The citation is:
   > Yixiao Ma, Yunqiu Shao, Yueyue Wu, Yiqun Liu, Ruizhe Zhang, Min Zhang, and Shaoping Ma. *LeCaRD: A Legal Case Retrieval Dataset for Chinese Law System*. Information Retrieval (IR) 2 (2021), 22.

2. **CAIL2021-LCR**: The citation is:
   > CAIL2021-LCR. *Chinese AI Legal Challenge 2021: Legal Case Retrieval*. Available at: http://cail.cipsc.org.cn/task3.html?raceID=3&cail_tag=2021.

3. **CAIL2022-LCR**: The citation is:
   > CAIL2022-LCR. *Chinese AI Legal Challenge 2022: Legal Case Retrieval*. Available at: http://cail.cipsc.org.cn/task_summit.html?raceID=1&cail_tag=2022.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will involve summarizing the key aspects of each dataset, such as its purpose and any relevant characteristics, while maintaining the integrity of the citations.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that they are ready for review or further processing.
