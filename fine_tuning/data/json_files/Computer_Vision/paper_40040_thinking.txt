To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling Music Modality with a Key-Class Invariant Pitch Chroma CNN" by Anders Elowsson and Anders Friberg, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets section** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but the **datasets section (Section 5)** is likely where the authors will detail the datasets used.

In **Section 5.1 (Datasets)**, the authors describe two datasets:

1. **Dataset D1**: This dataset consists of 100 audio excerpts of popular music, each with an average length of 30 seconds. The excerpts were produced from MIDI and rated for modality by listeners.

2. **Dataset D2**: This dataset consists of 110 audio excerpts of film music, with an average length of 15 seconds. The authors note that there were duplicates in this dataset, which were removed, resulting in 103 unique musical excerpts. Similar to D1, these excerpts were also rated for modality by listeners.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites previous works that describe these datasets:

- For **Dataset D1**, the citation is:
  > Friberg, A., Schoonderwaldt, E., Hedblad, A., Fabiani, M., & Elowsson, A. (2014). Using listener-based perceptual features as intermediate representations in music information retrieval. *Journal of the Acoustic Society of America (JASA)*, 136(4), 1951-1963.

- For **Dataset D2**, the citation is:
  > Eerola, T., & Vuoskoski, J. K. (2011). A comparison of the discrete and dimensional models of emotion in music. *Psychology of Music*, 39(1), 18-49.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the study along with their proper citations.
