To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DiffStyler: Diffusion-based Localized Image Style Transfer" by Shaoxu Li, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced or described. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the research, and while it may not mention specific datasets, it sets the context for the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study.

In the **methodology section**, the authors may also discuss any datasets used for training or testing their models. I will look for specific names of datasets, their sizes, and any relevant details that describe their content or structure.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary attribution and allows others to locate the datasets for their own research.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the **Segment Anything Model (SAM)** or **FastSAM**, I will ensure to find the original papers that describe these datasets:

1. **Segment Anything Model (SAM)**: 
   > Alexander Kirillov et al. "Segment Anything." arXiv:2304.02643, 2023.

2. **FastSAM**: 
   > Xu Zhao et al. "Fast Segment Anything." 2023.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented by the authors.
