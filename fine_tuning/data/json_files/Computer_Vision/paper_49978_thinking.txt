To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learnable Multi-level Frequency Decomposition and Hierarchical Attention Mechanism for Generalized Face Presentation Attack Detection" by Meiling Fang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method is evaluated in both intra-dataset and cross-dataset setups, which suggests that multiple datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they list four publicly available face PAD datasets:

1. **Oulu-NPU Dataset**: This dataset consists of 55 subjects and 5940 videos recorded by six mobile phones, with four protocols provided to evaluate generalizability.

2. **CASIA-MFSD Dataset**: This dataset includes 50 subjects and 600 videos captured by three different quality cameras, featuring three attack types: warped photo attack, cut photo attack, and video replay attack.

3. **Idiap Replay-Attack Dataset**: This dataset contains 50 subjects and 300 videos captured under different sensors and illumination conditions, including print and replay attacks.

4. **MSU-MFSD Dataset**: This dataset consists of 35 subjects and 440 videos captured by two different resolutions of cameras, also including printed photo attacks and replay attacks.

The authors provide a detailed description of each dataset, including the number of subjects, videos, and types of attacks, which confirms their relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are captured for future reference or processing.
