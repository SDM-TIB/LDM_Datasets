To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compressed Sensing using Generative Models" by Ashish Bora et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Models)**, where the authors describe the generative models used in their experiments. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of about 60,000 images of handwritten digits, where each image is of size 28 × 28. The authors trained a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) on this dataset.

2. **CelebA Dataset**: This dataset contains more than 200,000 face images of celebrities, with each image cropped to a size of 64 × 64 pixels. The authors used a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) on this dataset.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide additional context about how these datasets were used in their experiments, confirming their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For the **CelebA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 3730–3738, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation for each dataset, ready for structured output.
