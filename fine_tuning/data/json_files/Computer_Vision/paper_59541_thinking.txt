To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3D Data Augmentation for Driving Scenes on Camera" by Wenwen Tong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method on the **Waymo** and **nuScenes** datasets, indicating that these are the primary datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets and Metrics)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **Waymo Dataset**: This dataset is described as a large-scale dataset for autonomous driving, containing 798 training scenes and 202 validation scenes. The authors also note the image resolution and the evaluation metrics used.

2. **nuScenes Dataset**: This dataset is identified as a widely used benchmark for 3D object detection, containing 700 training scenes and 150 validation scenes. The authors provide details about the image resolution and the metrics used for evaluation.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Waymo Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pei Sun, Henrik Kretzschmar, Xerxes Dotiwalla, Aurelien Chouard, Vijaysai Patnaik, Paul Tsui, James Guo, Yin Zhou, Yuning Chai, Benjamin Caine, et al. *Scalability in perception for autonomous driving: Waymo open dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2446–2454, 2020.

- For the **nuScenes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yu Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *nuscenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 11621–11631, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets utilized in the research and their corresponding references.
