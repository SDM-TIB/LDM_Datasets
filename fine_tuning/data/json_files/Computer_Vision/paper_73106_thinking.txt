To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RemoCap: Disentangled Representation Learning for Motion Capture" by Hongsheng Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method demonstrates superior performance on benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets**. In this case, the paper has a section titled **3.3 (Datasets and metrics)**, which is likely to contain the necessary information about the datasets used in their experiments.

Upon reviewing this section, I find that the authors mention two datasets:

1. **3DPW**: This dataset is described as a comprehensive collection of multi-person 3D poses captured in real-world scenarios, featuring 60 videos recorded at 30 fps. It includes synchronized multi-view images and 2D pose annotations, making it suitable for evaluating 3D human pose estimation algorithms.

2. **Human3.6M**: This is an established benchmark dataset that captures diverse human activities in a controlled indoor environment. It includes synchronized multi-view videos, 3D joint annotations, and ground-truth camera parameters, providing a valuable resource for researchers.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **3DPW**, the citation is:
  > Timo von Marcard, Roberto Henschel, Michael J. Black, Bodo Rosenhahn, and Gerard Pons-Moll. *Recovering accurate 3D human pose in the wild using IMUs and a moving camera*. In Computer Vision – ECCV 2018, pages 614–631. Springer, 2018.

- For **Human3.6M**, the citation is:
  > Catalin Ionescu, Dragos Papava, Vlad Olaru, and Cristian Sminchisescu. *Human3.6m: Large scale datasets and predictive methods for 3D human sensing in natural environments*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 1325–1339, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
