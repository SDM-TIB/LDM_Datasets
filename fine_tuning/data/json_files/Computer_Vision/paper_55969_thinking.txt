To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Natural Color Fool: Towards Boosting Black-box Unrestricted Attacks" by Shengming Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors propose a method guided by realistic color distributions sampled from a publicly available dataset. This indicates that a dataset is involved, but I need to find its specific name and details.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Setup)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that they conducted their experiments on the **ImageNet-compatible Dataset**, which is comprised of 1,000 images and is widely used in recent transfer-based attacks. This is a clear identification of a dataset used in their research.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors refer to the **ADE20K dataset** in their methodology, which is used to build a color distribution library. The citation for the ADE20K dataset is:

- **ADE20K Dataset**:
  > Bolei Zhou, Hang Zhao, Xavier Puig, Sanja Fidler, Adela Barriuso, and Antonio Torralba. *Scene parsing through ADE20K dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format. The datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **ImageNet-compatible Dataset**: Used for experiments, consisting of 1,000 images.
2. **ADE20K Dataset**: Used for building the color distribution library.

I will ensure that I have the full citations for both datasets, as they are crucial for proper documentation and referencing in any subsequent work or analysis.
