To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quadratic growth during the COVID-19 pandemic: merging hotspots and reinfections" by Axel Brandenburg, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a model that describes the behavior of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction discusses the emergence of the pandemic and references various studies, which may lead to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **results** sections. In this paper, there is a **Code and data availability statement** towards the end, which indicates that datasets are available on Zenodo with a specific DOI. This is a crucial piece of information.

I will note that the paper references a dataset titled "Datasets for Piecewise quadratic growth during the 2019 novel coronavirus epidemic," which is linked to the DOI provided. This indicates that the author has made datasets available for public access.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The relevant citation is:

- **Datasets for Piecewise quadratic growth during the 2019 novel coronavirus epidemic**:
  > Brandenburg A. *Datasets for Piecewise quadratic growth during the 2019 novel coronavirus epidemic*. Zenodo, doi:10.5281/zenodo.4016941 (v2020.09.07).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

In summary, I have identified one dataset from the paper, and I will prepare to format this information according to the specified requirements.
