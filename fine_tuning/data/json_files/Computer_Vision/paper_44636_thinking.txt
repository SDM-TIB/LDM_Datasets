To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Scene Text Detection with Selected Anchors" by Anna Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on several standard benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **IV. DATASET section**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **COCO-Text**: This dataset contains 63,686 images with 173,589 labeled text regions. It provides bounding box locations and classifications for text legibility and category. The authors specifically mention using around 10,000 machine-printed text images for validation.

2. **ICDAR2013**: This dataset consists of 229 training images and 233 test images, primarily featuring horizontal text. The authors note that 848 text regions are cropped for training purposes.

3. **ICDAR2015**: This dataset is designed for the text localization of incidental scene text challenges, containing a total of 1500 images. It includes annotations with irregular quadrilateral bounding box vertices and orientation information.

4. **MSRA-TD500**: This dataset comprises 300 training images and 200 test images, featuring text regions of arbitrary orientations, annotated in RBOX format.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **COCO-Text**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Veit, et al. *COCO-Text: Dataset and Benchmark for Text Detection and Recognition in Natural Images*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1601.07140, 2016.

- For **ICDAR2013**, the citation is:
  > Dimosthenis Karatzas, et al. *ICDAR 2013 Robust Reading Competition*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), pp. 1484-1493, 2013.

- For **ICDAR2015**, the citation is:
  > Dimosthenis Karatzas, et al. *ICDAR 2015 Robust Reading Competition*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), pp. 1156-1160, 2015.

- For **MSRA-TD500**, the citation is:
  > C. Yao, X. Bai, W. Liu, Y. Ma, and Z. Tu. *Detecting Texts of Arbitrary Orientations in Natural Images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1083â€“1090, 2012.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
