To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UOD: Universal One-shot Detection of Anatomical Landmarks" by Heqin Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on "three widely-used public X-ray datasets in different anatomical domains (i.e., head, hand, chest)." This suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will move to the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the importance of anatomical landmark detection and the challenges faced in the field. While this section provides context, it does not explicitly name the datasets.

I will then focus on the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly the **Datasets** subsection, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **Head Dataset**: This dataset is used for the IEEE ISBI 2015 challenge and contains 400 X-ray cephalometric images, with 150 images for training and 250 for testing. Each image has 19 landmarks manually labeled by medical experts.

2. **Hand Dataset**: Collected by Gertych et al., this dataset consists of 909 X-ray images with 37 landmarks annotated. The dataset is split into a training set of 609 images and a test set of 300 images.

3. **Chest Dataset**: This dataset is a popular chest radiography database collected by the Japanese Society of Radiological Technology (JSRT), containing 247 images. It is split into a training set of 197 images and a test set of 50 images, with 6 landmarks selected from the boundary of the lung.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Head Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, C.W., Huang, C.T., Lee, J.H., Li, C.H., Chang, S.W., Siao, M.J., Lai, T.M., Ibragimov, B., Vrtovec, T., Ronneberger, O., et al. *A benchmark for comparison of dental radiography analysis algorithms*. Medical image analysis 31, 63–76 (2016).

- For the **Hand Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gertych, A., Zhang, A., Sayre, J., Pospiech-Kurkowska, S., Huang, H. *Bone age assessment of children using a digital hand atlas*. Computerized medical imaging and graphics 31(4-5), 322–331 (2007).

- For the **Chest Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shiraishi, J., Katsuragawa, S., Ikezoe, J., Matsumoto, T., Kobayashi, T., Komatsu, K.i., Matsui, M., Fujita, H., Kodera, Y., Doi, K. *Development of a digital image database for chest radiographs with and without a lung nodule: receiver operating characteristic analysis of radiologists’ detection of pulmonary nodules*. American Journal of Roentgenology 174(1), 71–74 (2000).

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
