To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AUDIOTOKEN: Adaptation of Text-Conditioned Diffusion Models for Audio-to-Image Generation" by Guy Yariv et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used for evaluation or comparison.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention leveraging a pre-trained audio encoding model and a text-to-image generation model, but they do not specify any datasets yet. I will need to look further into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Results)**, where the authors typically present their experimental setup and the datasets used. Here, they mention using the **VGGSound dataset**, which is derived from YouTube videos and contains 200,000 audio-visual samples, annotated with 309 classes. This is a significant dataset for their experiments.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm the details about the VGGSound dataset and ensure that it is the only dataset used. The authors describe how they randomly crop five-second audio clips and select corresponding frames, which further confirms the dataset's relevance.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the VGGSound dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

> H. Chen, W. Xie, A. Vedaldi, and A. Zisserman. *VGGSound: A large-scale audio-visual dataset*. In ICASSP, 2020.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction as follows:

1. **VGGSound Dataset**: A large-scale dataset derived from YouTube videos, containing 200,000 samples, each lasting ten seconds, and annotated with 309 classes.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included.
