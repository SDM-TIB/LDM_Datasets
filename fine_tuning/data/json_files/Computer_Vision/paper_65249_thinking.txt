To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ConditionVideo: Training-Free Condition-Guided Video Generation" by Bo Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the development of a training-free method for video generation but does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, I will keep an eye out for any references to datasets or benchmarks in the introduction.

Next, I will look into the **experiments** section, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. I will specifically check for any subsections that might be dedicated to datasets or experimental setups. If the authors mention any datasets used for training or evaluation, I will note their names and descriptions.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any figures or tables that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics. For instance, if there are any visual representations of the data or comparisons between different datasets, these could provide valuable insights.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as I need to ensure that I provide accurate and complete citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper.

If the paper does not provide full citations directly, I may need to look up the datasets online to find their original sources and ensure I have the correct citation format.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset descriptions and their citations in a clear and organized manner. This will include the dataset name, a brief description of its contents, and the full citation for each dataset.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a comprehensive overview that adheres to academic standards.
