To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RadiomicsFill-Mammo: Synthetic Mammogram Mass Manipulation with Radiomics Features" by Inye Na et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the development of a technique called RadiomicsFill-Mammo, which generates synthetic mammogram mass images. This suggests that there may be datasets involved in the study, particularly related to mammography.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (Method)**, specifically **subsection 2.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their study. Here, they state that they employed the **VinDr-Mammo dataset**, which contains 5,000 full-field digital mammography cases. This is a key dataset for the research, and I will note its details.

The authors provide additional context about the dataset, including its structure and how it was utilized in their experiments. They mention that the data were pre-split into training and test sets at a 4:1 ratio, focusing on samples with mass findings or no findings. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's application in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **VinDr-Mammo dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Nguyen, H.T., Nguyen, H.Q., Pham, H.H., Lam, K., Le, L.T., Dao, M., Vu, V. (2023). *VinDr-Mammo: A large-scale benchmark dataset for computer-aided diagnosis in full-field digital mammography*. Scientific Data, 10(1), 277. https://vindr.ai/datasets/mammo

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset entry for the **VinDr-Mammo dataset** and prepare it for any further processing or review.
