To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RX-ADS: Interpretable Anomaly Detection using Adversarial ML for Electric Vehicle CAN data" by Chathurika S. Wickramasinghe et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their approach on two benchmark CAN datasets: **OTIDS** and **Car Hacking**. This is a strong indication that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments** section. The authors mention that the RX-ADS approach was tested on the **OTIDS** dataset, which contains real CAN data collected from a Kia Soul vehicle during normal behavior and various attacks (DoS, Fuzzy, and impersonate). They also refer to the **Car Hacking** dataset, which includes real CAN data from a Hyundai YF Sonata, containing baseline data and data files with DoS and Fuzzy attacks.

I will then check the **references** section to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **OTIDS dataset**, the citation is:
> H. Lee, S. H. Jeong, and H. K. Kim. "OTIDS: A novel intrusion detection system for in-vehicle network by using remote frame." In 2017 15th Annual Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust (PST), 2017, pp. 57–5709. DOI: 10.1109/PST.2017.00017.

For the **Car Hacking dataset**, the citation is:
> M. E. Verma, M. D. Iannacone, R. A. Bridges, S. C. Hollifield, B. Kay, and F. L. Combs. "ROAD: the real ORNL automotive dynamometer controller area network intrusion detection dataset (with a comprehensive CAN IDS dataset survey & guide)." CoRR, vol. abs/2012.14600, 2020. arXiv: 2012.14600. Available: https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14600.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **OTIDS Dataset**: Contains real CAN data from a Kia Soul vehicle, including normal behavior and various attack scenarios.
   - Citation: H. Lee, S. H. Jeong, and H. K. Kim. "OTIDS: A novel intrusion detection system for in-vehicle network by using remote frame." In 2017 15th Annual Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust (PST), 2017, pp. 57–5709. DOI: 10.1109/PST.2017.00017.

2. **Car Hacking Dataset**: Contains real CAN data from a Hyundai YF Sonata, including baseline data and data files with DoS and Fuzzy attacks.
   - Citation: M. E. Verma, M. D. Iannacone, R. A. Bridges, S. C. Hollifield, B. Kay, and F. L. Combs. "ROAD: the real ORNL automotive dynamometer controller area network intrusion detection dataset (with a comprehensive CAN IDS dataset survey & guide)." CoRR, vol. abs/2012.14600, 2020. arXiv: 2012.14600. Available: https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14600.

With this information, I can now proceed to format the dataset entries as required.
