To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Kuramoto model based analysis reveals oxytocin effects on brain network dynamics" by Shuhan Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the study tests on fMRI data of 59 participants, which indicates that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **method section**. Here, the authors describe the participants and the data acquisition process. They mention that 59 right-handed male college students were recruited, and the fMRI scans were conducted using a 3T Siemens Tim Trio scanner. This gives me information about the dataset's size and the type of data collected.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail the fMRI acquisition and the preprocessing steps, confirming that the dataset consists of fMRI data from the participants. However, they do not provide a specific name for the dataset, so I will refer to it as the "fMRI dataset of 59 participants."

Now, I will check the **references section** to see if there are any citations related to the dataset or the methodology used for data collection. However, the paper does not cite a specific dataset but rather describes the data collection process in detail.

Since the dataset is derived from the authors' own research, I will create a citation for it based on the information provided in the paper. The citation will include the authors, title, and a note about the dataset being derived from their study.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> Zheng, S., Liang, Z., Qu, Y., Wu, Q., Wu, H., & Liu, Q. (2021). *Kuramoto model based analysis reveals oxytocin effects on brain network dynamics*. Unpublished dataset from fMRI study of 59 participants.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will allow for proper attribution and reference in any future work that utilizes this dataset.
