To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Auxiliary Knowledge-Induced Learning for Automatic Multi-Label Medical Document Classification" by Xindi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the **MIMIC-III dataset**, which is a significant indicator that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors discuss their methodology and the datasets used for evaluation. In **section 4.1 (Dataset and pre-processing)**, the authors clearly state that they are using the **MIMIC-III dataset**. They describe it as the largest publicly available clinical dataset for text, comprising hospital records associated with over 40,000 patients, specifically focusing on discharge summaries labeled with ICD-9 codes.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MIMIC-III dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **MIMIC-III Dataset**:
  > Johnson, Alistair EW, Pollard, Tom J, Shen, Lu, Lehman, Li-wei H, Feng, Mengling, Ghassemi, Mohammad, Moody, Benjamin, Szolovits, Peter, Celi, Leo Anthony, and Mark, Roger G. 2016. *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Nature Publishing Group.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation.

In summary, the steps I took include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction to identify mentions of datasets.
2. Focusing on the experiments section to confirm the dataset used.
3. Retrieving the full citation from the references section.

With this information, I am ready to create the dataset entry for the MIMIC-III dataset.
