To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing NeRF akin to Enhancing LLMs: Generalizable NeRF Transformer with Mixture-of-View-Experts" by Wenyan Cong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors discuss their experiments on various datasets, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically detail the datasets used for training and testing their models. Here, they mention specific datasets such as:

1. **Google Scanned Objects**: This dataset consists of object renderings of 1023 models, which is used for training.
2. **RealEstate10K**: A dataset containing 10,000 images of real estate properties, also used for training.
3. **Spaces Dataset**: This dataset includes 90 scenes, contributing to the training data.
4. **NMR Dataset**: This dataset contains 360° views of various objects from unseen categories, used for testing.
5. **Shiny-6 Dataset**: A dataset with challenging view-dependent optical effects, used for testing.
6. **Tanks-and-Temples Dataset**: A complex outdoor dataset containing large unbounded scenes, used for testing.
7. **NeRF Synthetic Dataset**: A dataset consisting of 8, 360° scenes of objects with complicated geometry and realistic material, used for testing.
8. **Local Light Field Fusion (LLFF)**: A dataset consisting of forward-facing captures of real-world scenes using a smartphone, also used for testing.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, the citation for the **Google Scanned Objects** dataset is:
> Downs, L., Francis, A., Koenig, N., Kinman, B., Hickman, R., Reymann, K., McHugh, T. B., & Vanhoucke, V. (2022). Google scanned objects: A high-quality dataset of 3D scanned household items. arXiv preprint arXiv:2204.11918.

Similarly, I will gather citations for the other datasets mentioned in the paper.

Once I have compiled all the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the work presented in the paper.
