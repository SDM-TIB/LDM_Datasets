To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Digital Electronics and Analog Photonics for Convolutional Neural Networks (DEAP-CNNs)" by Viraj Bangari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **MNIST handwriting dataset** as a benchmark for their DEAP CNN architecture, which indicates that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** more closely. Here, the authors state that they trained their CNN using the **MNIST dataset**. This confirms that the MNIST dataset is indeed used in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any additional datasets mentioned. The authors also refer to the **DeepBench dataset** when discussing performance benchmarks of their DEAP architecture. This dataset is used to compare the convolution times of various GPUs, which is relevant to their analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
   > Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 2010. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

2. For the **DeepBench dataset**, the citation is:
   > B. Research. *DeepBench*. Available at: https://github.com/DeepBench/DeepBench

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
