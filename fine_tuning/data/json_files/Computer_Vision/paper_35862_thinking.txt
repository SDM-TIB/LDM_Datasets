To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convolutional Analysis Operator Learning: Acceleration and Convergence" by Il Yong Chun and Jeffrey A. Fessler, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors discuss multiple datasets used for their experiments, including the **fruit dataset**, **city dataset**, and **CT datasets**. I will note the details provided for each dataset, such as the number of images, dimensions, and any specific characteristics mentioned.

In the **results section**, I will confirm the datasets used in the experiments and any performance metrics associated with them. This will help ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets relevant to the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, the paper mentions:
1. **Fruit Dataset**: L = 10, N = 100 × 100.
2. **City Dataset**: L = 10, N = 100 × 100.
3. **CT Dataset (CT-(i))**: L = 80, N = 128 × 128, created from down-sampled 512 × 512 XCAT phantom slices.
4. **CT Dataset (CT-(ii))**: L = 10, N = 512 × 512, also from down-sampled 512 × 512 XCAT phantom slices.

I will then compile the full citations for these datasets, ensuring to include all necessary details such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
