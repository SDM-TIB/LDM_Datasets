To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Effect of Demographic Stochasticity on Predatory-Prey Oscillations" by Solmaz Golmohammadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on the Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model and its dynamics, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the study. The introduction discusses the theoretical framework and previous works but does not specify any datasets.

I will then look into the **methods and results sections** to see if the authors describe any simulations or data used for their analysis. In this case, the authors mention using the Gillespie algorithm for numerical simulations of the stochastic Rosenzweig-MacArthur model, but they do not provide specific datasets or empirical data.

Since the paper primarily focuses on theoretical modeling and simulations rather than empirical datasets, I will check the **acknowledgments and references sections** for any citations that might refer to datasets or previous studies that provided data. However, the references mainly cite foundational works related to the theoretical aspects of predator-prey dynamics and stochastic processes, rather than specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that there are no explicit datasets mentioned that can be extracted with full citations. The authors rely on theoretical models and simulations rather than empirical datasets.

In conclusion, I will note that while the paper discusses important theoretical concepts and simulations, it does not provide specific datasets for extraction. Therefore, I will not create any dataset entries as there are none to report.
