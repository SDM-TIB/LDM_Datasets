To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Label Design-based ELM Network for Timing Synchronization in OFDM Systems with Nonlinear Distortion" by Chaojin Qing et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental analysis sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of an ELM-based network for timing synchronization in OFDM systems, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section V) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any references to datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing Section V, I find that the authors mention using a dataset for their simulations, but they do not provide a specific name for it. Instead, they describe the parameters and settings used in their simulations, such as the number of sub-carriers, cyclic prefix length, and signal-to-noise ratio. This indicates that they may have used synthetic data generated based on these parameters rather than a publicly available dataset.

Since no specific datasets are cited in the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the cited works provide datasets that could be relevant. I will look for papers that might have published datasets related to OFDM systems or timing synchronization.

In the References, I find several papers that could potentially relate to datasets, but none explicitly mention a dataset that was used in this study. The references primarily discuss methodologies and previous works in the field of OFDM and machine learning.

Given that the paper does not provide specific datasets or their citations, I will conclude that there are no publicly available datasets extracted from this paper. However, I will note the references that could be relevant for future research or dataset exploration.

Now, I will summarize my findings:

1. **No specific datasets were mentioned in the paper.**
2. **The experiments were conducted using parameters rather than named datasets.**
3. **Relevant references were found, but they do not provide datasets directly used in this study.**

Since I cannot provide full citations for datasets that do not exist in this context, I will document the references that may be useful for further exploration of related datasets in the field.

In conclusion, I will prepare a summary of the findings and the relevant references for future reference.
