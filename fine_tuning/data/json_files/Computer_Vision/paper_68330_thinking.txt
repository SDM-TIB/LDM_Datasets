To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DDPM based X-ray Image Synthesizer" by Thulana Abeywardane et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors used "over 3000 pneumonia X-ray images obtained from Kaggle for training." This indicates that there is a specific dataset that I need to look into further.

Next, I will review the **introduction** section to see if there are any additional details about the dataset or its source. The introduction emphasizes the challenges of obtaining positive cases for pneumonia detection, reinforcing the importance of the dataset mentioned in the abstract.

I will then check the **methodology** section, particularly where the authors discuss the dataset used for training. They mention that they trained their DDPM model on a dataset of over 3000 pneumonia X-ray images obtained from Kaggle. This confirms the dataset's relevance and its application in their research.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will look into the **references section** of the paper. However, the specific dataset from Kaggle may not have a formal citation in the references. Instead, I will need to provide a general citation for Kaggle as a source of datasets. The citation format for Kaggle typically includes the dataset title, the author (if available), and the URL.

For the pneumonia X-ray dataset, I will use the following citation:
> "Chest X-ray Images (Pneumonia)." Kaggle. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia (accessed [insert access date]).

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: Pneumonia X-ray Images
   - **Description**: A dataset containing over 3000 X-ray images of pneumonia cases, used for training the DDPM model.
   - **Source**: Kaggle
   - **Citation**: "Chest X-ray Images (Pneumonia)." Kaggle. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia (accessed [insert access date]).

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entry in the required format for further processing or review. This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details regarding the dataset used in the research paper.
