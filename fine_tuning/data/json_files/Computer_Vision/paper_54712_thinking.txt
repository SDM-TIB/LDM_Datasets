To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ReconÔ¨Ågurable Plug-and-play Distributed Model Predictive Control for Reference Tracking" by Ahmed Aboudonia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed scheme on a network of mass-spring-damper systems, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these systems.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Simulation Results)**, where the authors describe the simulation setup. They mention using a network of eight mass-spring-damper (MSD) systems, but I need to check if they provide any specific datasets or references to existing datasets.

In this section, the authors detail the dynamics of each mass and the parameters used for the simulation, such as mass, stiffness, and damping coefficients. However, they do not explicitly mention a publicly available dataset; instead, they describe the simulation parameters and the methodology used to generate the data.

Since no specific datasets are cited in the paper, I will look at the **References section** to see if any of the cited works provide datasets that could be relevant. The references include various papers on model predictive control and decentralized control, but again, they do not seem to point to any specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, I conclude that while the authors conducted simulations using a specific model (mass-spring-damper systems), they did not reference any external datasets or provide full citations for datasets used in their experiments.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were explicitly mentioned or cited in the paper, and therefore, there are no full citations to provide for datasets. If I were to summarize the findings, I would note the absence of datasets while highlighting the simulation parameters used in their experiments.
