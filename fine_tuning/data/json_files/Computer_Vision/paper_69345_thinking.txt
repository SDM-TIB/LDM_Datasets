To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AdaFlow: Imitation Learning with Variance-Adaptive Flow-Based Policies" by Xixi Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the AdaFlow framework but does not specify any datasets. Moving to the **introduction**, I will look for references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**, particularly sections that detail the experimental setup and results. This section is likely to contain explicit mentions of datasets used in the experiments. 

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using datasets in the context of their experiments. Specifically, they refer to the following datasets:

1. **RoboMimic**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the AdaFlow framework in robot manipulation tasks. The paper mentions that they follow the exact experimental setup described in previous works, which indicates that RoboMimic is a well-established dataset in the field.

2. **LIBERO**: Another dataset mentioned in the context of robot manipulation tasks. The authors specify that they use a subset of six kitchen tasks from this dataset to evaluate their method.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **RoboMimic**, the citation is:
  > Mandlekar, A., Xu, D., Wong, J., Nasiriany, S., Wang, C., Kulkarni, R., Fei-Fei, L., Savarese, S., Zhu, Y., and Martín-Martín, R. *What matters in learning from offline human demonstrations for robot manipulation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2108.03298, 2021.

- For **LIBERO**, the citation is:
  > Liu, B., Zhu, Y., Gao, C., Feng, Y., Liu, Q., Zhu, Y., and Stone, P. *Libero: Benchmarking knowledge transfer for lifelong robot learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.03310, 2023.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

1. **RoboMimic**: A benchmark dataset for robot manipulation tasks, providing a variety of demonstrations for training and evaluation.
2. **LIBERO**: A dataset designed for benchmarking knowledge transfer in lifelong robot learning, containing multiple tasks relevant to robot manipulation.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
