To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LogoSticker: Inserting Logos into Diffusion Models for Customized Generation" by Mingkang Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a novel task of logo insertion and the introduction discusses the challenges of integrating logos into diffusion models, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup, including the construction of a dataset of 20 unique logos. This indicates that there is a dataset specifically created for their experiments.

I will also check for any details about how the dataset was constructed, such as the types of logos included and the contexts in which they were tested. The authors mention that they collected a dataset of logos that includes texts with patterns, English texts, and Chinese texts with intricate calligraphy. This provides insight into the dataset's composition.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The paper does not appear to reference external datasets but rather describes the dataset they created for their own experiments. Therefore, I will document the dataset as follows:

1. **Logo Dataset**: This dataset consists of 20 unique logos, including various texts and patterns. The logos are tested in 20 different contexts to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Since the dataset is original to the authors and does not have an external citation, I will note that it is a custom dataset created for the study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper itself, as it is essential to credit the authors for their work.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Mingkang Zhu, Xi Chen, Zhongdao Wang, Hengshuang Zhao, Jiaya Jia. *LogoSticker: Inserting Logos into Diffusion Models for Customized Generation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2023.

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for further processing.
