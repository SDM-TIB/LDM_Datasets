To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Implementation of Lenia as a Reaction-Diffusion System" by Hiroki Kojima and Takashi Ikegami, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract primarily discusses the theoretical aspects of the research without mentioning specific datasets, so I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the relationship between reaction-diffusion systems and cellular automata, particularly focusing on Lenia. However, there are no datasets mentioned here either. I will continue to the **results section** where the authors describe their findings and implementations.

As I review the **results section**, I will look for any references to datasets used for simulations or experiments. The paper discusses the implementation of the asymptotic Lenia and its emulation through reaction-diffusion systems, but it does not specify any datasets that were used for validation or testing.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. The references primarily consist of theoretical papers and do not indicate any specific datasets used in the experiments.

Since the paper does not mention any datasets explicitly or implicitly, I conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this research paper. 

In summary, I will document that no datasets were found in the paper "Implementation of Lenia as a Reaction-Diffusion System" by Hiroki Kojima and Takashi Ikegami, and therefore, there are no citations to provide.
