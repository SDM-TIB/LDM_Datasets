To extract datasets from the research paper titled "COMMA: Co-Articulated Multi-Modal Learning" by Lianyu Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they state that they evaluate their method across three representative tasks, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved. I will look for a dedicated section on datasets or any mention of datasets within the experimental setup.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors list several datasets used for their evaluations:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset commonly used for image classification tasks. It contains millions of labeled images across thousands of categories.

2. **Caltech101**: A dataset consisting of images of 101 object categories, used for fine-grained classification tasks.

3. **OxfordPets**: A dataset containing images of cats and dogs, used for classification tasks.

4. **StanfordCars**: A dataset with images of cars from various manufacturers, also used for classification tasks.

5. **Flowers102**: A dataset containing images of 102 flower categories, used for fine-grained classification.

6. **Food101**: A dataset with images of 101 food categories, used for classification tasks.

7. **FGVCAircraft**: A dataset containing images of various aircraft models, used for fine-grained classification.

8. **SUN397**: A scene recognition dataset with images from 397 categories, used for scene classification tasks.

9. **UCF101**: A dataset for action recognition containing videos of 101 human action classes.

10. **DTD (Describable Textures Dataset)**: A dataset for texture classification.

11. **EuroSAT**: A dataset for land use and land cover classification, containing satellite images.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. Here are the citations I will extract:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
