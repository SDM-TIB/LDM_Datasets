To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gaussian Mixture Convolution Networks" by Adam Celarek et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and often mentions the datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors mention that their method achieves competitive accuracy on datasets like **MNIST** and **ModelNet**.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. Here, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics. 

In the evaluation section, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The authors describe it as consisting of 70,000 handwritten digits from 10 different classes. They mention that their model achieved an accuracy of 99.4% on this dataset.

2. **ModelNet10 Dataset**: This dataset is used for 3D classification and consists of 4,800 different models from 10 categories. The authors report that their model achieved an accuracy of 93.3% on this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. 

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998. doi: 10.1109/5.726791.

- For the **ModelNet10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhirong Wu, Shuran Song, Aditya Khosla, Fisher Yu, Linguang Zhang, Xiaoou Tang, and Jianxiong Xiao. *3D ShapeNets: A deep representation for volumetric shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1912–1920, 2015. doi: 10.1109/CVPR.2015.7298801.

With the dataset names and their citations in hand, I will now compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
