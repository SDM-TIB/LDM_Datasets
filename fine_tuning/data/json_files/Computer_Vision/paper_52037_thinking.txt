To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PCENet: High Dimensional Surrogate Modeling for Learning Uncertainty" by Paz Fink Shustin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for numerical experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **numerical results section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention that they illustrate the performance of PCE-Net on five datasets from different applications. I will look for specific names and descriptions of these datasets.

Upon reviewing section 4, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Boston Housing Dataset**: This dataset concerns housing values in the suburbs of Boston and consists of 506 samples with 13 features. It is referenced as being published in Harrison Jr and Rubinfeld (1978).

2. **Parkinson Speech Dataset**: This dataset includes sound recordings from 20 individuals with Parkinson's disease and 20 healthy individuals, totaling 1040 samples. It is referenced as being collected and studied in Sakar et al. (2013).

3. **Diabetes Dataset**: This dataset consists of 442 diabetes patients with ten health features and is analyzed in Efron et al. (2004).

4. **Allen-Cahn Equation Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the Allen-Cahn equation, where the authors sampled data points from different normal distributions to learn the input-output relation.

5. **Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equation Dataset**: Similar to the Allen-Cahn dataset, this dataset is generated from the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, with sampled data points used to learn the input-output relations.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **Boston Housing Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. L. Harrison Jr and D. L. Rubinfeld. *Hedonic housing prices and the demand for clean air*. Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 5(1):81–102, 1978.

- For the **Parkinson Speech Dataset**, the citation is:
  > B. E. Sakar, M. E. Isenkul, C. O. Sakar, A. Sertbas, F. Gurgen, S. Delil, H. Apaydin, and O. Kursun. *Collection and analysis of a Parkinson speech dataset with multiple types of sound recordings*. IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, 17(4):828–834, 2013.

- For the **Diabetes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > B. Efron, T. Hastie, I. Johnstone, and R. Tibshirani. *Least angle regression*. The Annals of Statistics, 32(2):407–499, 2004.

The datasets related to the **Allen-Cahn** and **Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations** do not have specific citations as they are derived from the equations discussed in the paper by Han et al. (2018). Therefore, I will reference the original paper for these datasets.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited for future reference.
