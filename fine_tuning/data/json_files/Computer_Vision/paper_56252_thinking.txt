To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Attention Attention Everywhere: Monocular Depth Prediction with Skip Attention" by Ashutosh Agarwal and Chetan Arora, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two canonical datasets, NYUV2 and KITTI, which suggests that these datasets are important for the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets and Evaluation)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **NYU Depth V2**: This dataset is described as containing 120K RGB and depth pairs, with images acquired from 464 indoor scenes using a Microsoft Kinect. The authors mention the specific training/testing split they used, which is crucial for understanding how the dataset was utilized in their experiments.

2. **KITTI Dataset**: This dataset consists of stereo images and 3D scans from 61 scenes captured by multiple sensors mounted on a moving vehicle. The authors provide details about the resolution of the images and the training/testing split they followed, which is important for replicating their results.

3. **SUNRGB-D**: This dataset is mentioned as containing 10,335 real RGB-D images of room scenes, with specific training and testing set sizes provided. The authors also mention the evaluation protocol they followed, which is relevant for understanding the dataset's application in their research.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **NYU Depth V2**, the citation is:
  > Nathan Silberman, Derek Hoiem, Pushmeet Kohli, and Rob Fergus. *Indoor segmentation and support inference from RGBD images*. In Computer Vision – ECCV 2012, pages 746–760, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2012. Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

- For **KITTI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, Christoph Stiller, and Raquel Urtasun. *Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset*. International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR), 2013.

- For **SUNRGB-D**, the citation is:
  > Shuran Song, Samuel P. Lichtenberg, and Jianxiong Xiao. *SUN RGB-D: A RGB-D scene understanding benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), June 2015.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for future reference or processing.
