To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Collaborative Autoencoder" by Qibing Li, Xiaolin Zheng, and Xinyue Wu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that they conducted extensive experiments on **three real-world datasets**. This indicates that datasets are indeed involved, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors state that they used three datasets: **MovieLens 10M**, **Delicious**, and **Lastfm**. I will note down these names and look for additional details about each dataset, such as their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

I will then check the **dataset descriptions** provided in the experiments section. The authors provide the following details:

1. **MovieLens 10M**: This dataset consists of user ratings on a scale of 0.5 to 5, with a total of 69,878 users, 1,867 items, and 10,000,054 ratings. The dataset is known for its sparsity, with a sparsity of 98.59%.

2. **Delicious**: This dataset contains user interactions where a user feedback for an item is considered as 1 if the user has bookmarked the item. It has 1,892 users, 69,226 items, and 104,799 ratings, with a sparsity of 99.92%.

3. **Lastfm**: Similar to Delicious, this dataset consists of user interactions where a user feedback for an item is considered as 1 if the user has listened to the item. It has 10,073 users, 92,834 items, and 9,945,875 ratings, with a sparsity of 99.72%.

After gathering this information, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **MovieLens 10M**, the citation is:
  > GroupLens Research. *MovieLens 10M Dataset*. Available at: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/10m.

- For **Delicious**, the citation is:
  > GroupLens Research. *Delicious Dataset*. Available at: https://grouplens.org/datasets/hetrec-2011.

- For **Lastfm**, the citation is:
  > GroupLens Research. *Lastfm Dataset*. Available at: https://grouplens.org/datasets/hetrec-2011.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets along with their full citations, which is crucial for proper referencing in research.
