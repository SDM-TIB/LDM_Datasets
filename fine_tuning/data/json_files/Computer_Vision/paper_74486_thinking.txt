To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Based AoI-Aware Resource Allocation for RIS-Aided IoV Networks" by Kangwei Qi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not contain specific dataset details. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will look for sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as **"Experiments," "Simulation," or "Methodology."** In this paper, the authors describe their simulation environment and parameters, but I need to confirm if they used any publicly available datasets or if they generated synthetic data.

I will also check the **References section** for any citations that might indicate the datasets used. If the authors refer to specific datasets, I will need to extract the full citations for those datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets. Instead, they describe a simulation environment with parameters such as the number of vehicles, communication models, and performance metrics. This suggests that the data used for their experiments is likely synthetic and generated based on the described models.

Since there are no datasets to cite, I will summarize the findings regarding the simulation parameters instead. However, if there were datasets mentioned, I would ensure to include the full citations in the format specified in the references.

In conclusion, I will compile the information regarding the simulation parameters and any relevant details about the methodology used in the experiments, but I will note that no specific datasets were cited in the paper.
