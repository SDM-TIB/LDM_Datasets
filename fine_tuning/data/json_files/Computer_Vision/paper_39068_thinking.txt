To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-Supervised Multitask Learning on Multispectral Satellite Images Using Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Predicting Poverty" by Anthony Perez et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors use **satellite images of the African continent from Landsat 7** and labels from **Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)**. This suggests that both the satellite images and the DHS data are key datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly **section 3 (Description of Data and Preprocessing)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets. They mention that they collected **multi-spectral imagery from Landsat 7** covering the African continent from **2004 to 2015**, amounting to about **22 TB** of data. This is a significant dataset for their analysis.

The authors also discuss the **Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)**, which provide **Asset Wealth Index (AWI)** labels for various countries in Africa. They specify that there are **4839 locations** with labels from the DHS survey for AWI values. This indicates that the DHS dataset is crucial for their model training and evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Landsat 7 imagery**, the citation is:
   > U.S. Geological Survey. *Landsat 7: Description of Spectral Bands*. Available at: https://landsat.usgs.gov. [Online; accessed 8-June-2017].

2. For the **Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)**, the citation is:
   > Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). *DHS Program*. Available at: https://dhsprogram.com. [Online; accessed 17-October-2016].

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

- **Dataset 1**: Landsat 7 Multi-Spectral Imagery
  - Description: Multi-spectral imagery covering the African continent from 2004 to 2015, amounting to about 22 TB.
  - Citation: U.S. Geological Survey. *Landsat 7: Description of Spectral Bands*. Available at: https://landsat.usgs.gov. [Online; accessed 8-June-2017].

- **Dataset 2**: Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)
  - Description: Provides Asset Wealth Index (AWI) labels for various countries in Africa, with 4839 locations having labels.
  - Citation: Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). *DHS Program*. Available at: https://dhsprogram.com. [Online; accessed 17-October-2016].

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
