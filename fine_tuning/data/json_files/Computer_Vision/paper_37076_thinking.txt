To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stabilizing Linear Prediction Models using Autoencoder" by Shivapratap Gopakumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on a heart failure cohort from an Australian hospital, which suggests that this is one of the datasets used.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 3) in detail. Here, the authors describe their experiments on two cohorts: 

1. **Heart Failure (HF) Cohort**: This cohort consists of 1,885 heart failure admissions from Barwon Health, an Australian hospital. The paper provides specific details about the cohort, including the number of admissions and the features extracted from the electronic medical records (EMR).

2. **Diabetes (DB) Cohort**: This cohort includes 2,840 diabetic admissions from the same hospital. The authors mention that this cohort was used to augment the training data for the autoencoder.

In section 3.1, the authors detail how they derived a lasso regularized logistic regression model from the HF cohort and used the DB cohort for augmentation. This confirms that both datasets are integral to their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from the authors' own research and the hospital's EMR database, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will document the datasets as follows:

- For the **Heart Failure (HF) Cohort**, I will note:
  > Gopakumar, S., Tran, T., Phung, D., & Venkatesh, S. (2023). *Stabilizing Linear Prediction Models using Autoencoder*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Page Numbers]. Barwon Health, Australia. 

- For the **Diabetes (DB) Cohort**, I will note:
  > Gopakumar, S., Tran, T., Phung, D., & Venkatesh, S. (2023). *Stabilizing Linear Prediction Models using Autoencoder*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Page Numbers]. Barwon Health, Australia.

Since these datasets are not publicly available and are based on the authors' own data collection, I will indicate that they are derived from the authors' research at Barwon Health.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that captures the essential details, including the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that the citations are formatted correctly and clearly indicate the source of the datasets.
