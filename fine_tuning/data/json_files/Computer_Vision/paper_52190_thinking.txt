To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ViKiNG: Vision-Based Kilometer-Scale Navigation with Geographic Hints" by Dhruv Shah and Sergey Levine, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **Section IV (Kilometer-Scale Testing)** and **Section IV-B (Offline Training Dataset)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for training and testing their navigation system. Here, they mention using a combination of 30 hours of autonomously collected data and 12 hours of teleoperated data.

In **Section IV-B**, the authors specify that the dataset consists of:
1. **Autonomously Collected Data**: This dataset includes over 5000 self-supervised trajectories collected in various real-world environments, which is crucial for training the navigation model.
2. **Teleoperated Data**: This dataset includes 12 hours of human teleoperated data collected in semantically rich environments, enhancing the quality of learned behaviors.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to a previous work by Shah et al. (2021) for the autonomously collected data, which is essential for proper citation.

The full citation for the dataset is:
- For the autonomously collected data:
  > Shah, D., Eysenbach, B., Kahn, G., Rhinehart, N., & Levine, S. (2021). *Rapid exploration for open-world navigation with latent goal models*. In Proceedings of the 5th Annual Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL).

The teleoperated data does not have a specific citation provided in the paper, but it is described as being collected in various environments, which I will note.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the datasets as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.
