To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SALIENCY-ENHANCED ROBUST VISUAL TRACKING" by Caglar Aytekin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions improvements in visual tracking but does not specify datasets. The introduction discusses various tracking methods but does not provide dataset names either.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (section 3), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **OTB-2013**: This dataset is widely used for evaluating visual tracking algorithms. The authors state that they use it for their algorithm's evaluation.

2. **UAV-123**: This is a recently introduced dataset specifically designed for UAV tracking, which the authors also use for their evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **OTB-2013**, the citation is:
  > Y. Wu, J. Lim, and M. H. Yang. *Online object tracking: A benchmark*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2411-2418, 2013.

- For **UAV-123**, the citation is:
  > M. Mueller, N. Smith, and B. Ghanem. *A benchmark and simulator for UAV tracking*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 445-461, 2016.

Having gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will now prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
