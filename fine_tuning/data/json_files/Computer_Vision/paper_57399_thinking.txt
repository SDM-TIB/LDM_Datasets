To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Class Segmentation from Aerial Views using Recursive Noise Diffusion" by Benedikt Kolbeinsson and Krystian Mikolajczyk, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the method achieves competitive results on the **UAVid dataset** and state-of-the-art performance on the **Vaihingen Building segmentation benchmark**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look specifically in **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail their experimental setup. In **section 4.1**, they mention using the **UAVid dataset**, which contains 420 images from aerial views, split into training, validation, and testing sets. They describe the classes included in this dataset, which is essential information.

In **section 4.2**, the authors discuss the **Vaihingen Buildings dataset**, specifying that it consists of 168 images, with a training set of 100 images and a test set of 68 images. They clarify the objective of labeling pixels as either the central building or background, which is relevant for understanding how the dataset is utilized.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **UAVid dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ye Lyu, George Vosselman, Gui-Song Xia, Alper Yilmaz, and Michael Ying Yang. *UAVid: A Semantic Segmentation Dataset for UAV Imagery*. ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 165:108–119, 2020.

2. For the **Vaihingen Buildings dataset**, the citation is:
   > Michael Cramer. *The DGPF-Test on Digital Airborne Camera Evaluation Overview and Test Design*. Photogrammetrie-Fernerkundung-Geoinformation, pages 73–82, 2010.

Having gathered this information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will involve summarizing the key details about each dataset, including its purpose, the number of images, and the classes involved, along with the citations.
