To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SmartSplit: Latency-Energy-Memory Optimisation for CNN Splitting on Smartphone Environment" by Ishan Prakash et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to look for any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will check if it mentions any datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section** to see if the authors reference any datasets that are relevant to their work. This section often provides context and background, which may include datasets that have been previously used in related studies.

Then, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** in detail. These sections typically describe the experimental setup and the specific datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **AlexNet** model, I will look for the original dataset associated with it, which is the **ImageNet dataset**. The citation for ImageNet is:
> Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. "ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge." International Journal of Computer Vision, vol. 115, no. 3, pp. 211-252, 2015.

If the paper mentions any other datasets, such as **VGG16** or **MobileNetV2**, I will similarly find their corresponding datasets and citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while providing proper citations for each one.
