To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Investigating Deep Watermark Security: An Adversarial Transferability Perspective" by Biqing Qi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on the **ImageNet dataset**, which indicates that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail. In the methodology, the authors describe their experimental setup and mention the **CIFAR-10 dataset** as well, which is used for transfer attack experiments. This is another dataset that needs to be documented.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers who may want to access these datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

1. For the **ImageNet dataset**, the citation is:
   > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L. Li, K. Li, and L. Fei-Fei. "ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database." In CVPR, 2009, pp. 248â€“255. [Online]. Available: https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206848

2. For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
   > A. Krizhevsky and G. Hinton. "Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images." Technical Report, 2009. [Online]. Available: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for future reference.
