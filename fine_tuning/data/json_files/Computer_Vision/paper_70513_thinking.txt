To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Phase Autoencoder for Limit-Cycle Oscillators" by Koichiro Yawata et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **numerical experiments section** (Section IV), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and testing their models. In this section, the authors mention using several types of limit-cycle oscillators, specifically:

1. **Stuart-Landau Oscillator**: The authors describe how they generated data for this oscillator through direct numerical simulations, specifying parameters such as the number of initial points and the sampling interval.

2. **FitzHugh-Nagumo Model**: Similar to the Stuart-Landau oscillator, the authors detail the parameters used for generating the dataset, including the number of initial points and the sampling interval.

3. **Hodgkin-Huxley Model**: The authors provide information about the parameters for this model and how the data was generated.

4. **Collectively Oscillating Network (CON) Model**: The authors describe the dataset generated for this model, including the number of initial points and the sampling interval.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to each model. The citations may not be explicitly provided for the datasets themselves, but I can infer them from the context of the models discussed.

For example, the citations for the models might look like this:

- **Stuart-Landau Oscillator**: 
  > Stuart, J. T. (1960). On the non-linear mechanics of wave disturbances in stable and unstable parallel flows. *Journal of Fluid Mechanics*, 9, 353-370.

- **FitzHugh-Nagumo Model**: 
  > FitzHugh, R. (1961). Impulses and physiological states in theoretical models of nerve membrane. *Biophysical Journal*, 1(6), 445-466.

- **Hodgkin-Huxley Model**: 
  > Hodgkin, A. L., & Huxley, A. F. (1952). A quantitative description of membrane current and its application to conduction and excitation in nerve. *The Journal of Physiology*, 117(500), 500-544.

- **Collectively Oscillating Network Model**: 
  > Nakao, H., Yasui, S., Ota, M., Arai, K., & Kawamura, Y. (2018). Phase reduction and synchronization of a network of coupled dynamical elements exhibiting collective oscillations. *Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science*, 28(3), 033601.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information from the paper.
