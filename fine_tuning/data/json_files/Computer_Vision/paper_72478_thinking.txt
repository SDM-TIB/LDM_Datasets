To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative AI for Low-Carbon Artificial Intelligence of Things" by Jinbo Wen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the integration of Generative AI (GAI) with the Internet of Things (IoT) and mentions simulation results, which may imply the use of datasets for validation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections** to identify any specific datasets used for simulations or evaluations. I will look for phrases like "we used the following datasets" or "the data was collected from" to pinpoint any datasets mentioned.

In the **section discussing the case study on mobile AIGC task offloading**, I will pay close attention to any datasets referenced for training or testing the models. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided about them.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial for ensuring that I have the correct and complete references for each dataset. If the datasets are derived from other studies or papers, I will extract the citations from there.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Energy Internet Dataset" or "Mobile Edge Network Dataset," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references to provide a complete citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is accurately documented for future reference or processing.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and accuracy in the documentation process.
