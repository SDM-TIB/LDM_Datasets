To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AU-vMAE: Knowledge-Guide Action Units Detection via Video Masked Autoencoder" by Qiaoqiao Jin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions challenges in Facial Action Unit (FAU) detection due to limited labeled video training data and references the use of datasets like BP4D and DISFA. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the limitations of existing datasets and explicitly mention the BP4D and DISFA datasets. They highlight that these datasets contain a limited number of videos, which is a significant point for understanding the context of their research.

In the **experiments section**, specifically section 4.1, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and testing. They mention:

1. **BP4D Dataset**: This dataset consists of 328 videos from 41 individuals, totaling around 147,000 frames. It is used for training and testing on 12 AU labels.

2. **DISFA Dataset**: This dataset contains 27 videos with 130,815 frames and is used for training and testing on 8 AU labels.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **BP4D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, X., Yin, L., Cohn, J.F., Canavan, S.J., Reale, M., Horowitz, A., Liu, P., Girard, J.M. (2014). *BP4D-Spontaneous: A High-Resolution Spontaneous 3D Dynamic Facial Expression Database*. Image and Vision Computing, 32(10), 692-706.

- For the **DISFA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mavadati, S.M., Mahoor, M.H., Bartlett, K., Trinh, P., Cohn, J.F. (2013). *DISFA: A Spontaneous Facial Action Intensity Database*. IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, 4(2), 151-160.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
