To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "IG Captioner: Information Gain Captioners are Strong Zero-shot Classifiers" by Chenglin Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors pretrain their models on the **Laion-5B dataset** and evaluate them on **ImageNet**, **MSCOCO**, and **Flickr30K**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for understanding the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) to gather detailed information about the datasets used. In section 4.1, the authors specify that they use the **Laion-5B dataset** for pretraining and the **ImageNet** dataset for zero-shot classification. They also mention that they perform evaluations on the **MSCOCO** and **Flickr30K** datasets for image-text retrieval tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Laion-5B Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Schuhmann, C., Beaumont, R., Vencu, R., Gordon, C., Wightman, R., Cherti, M., Coombes, T., Katta, A., Mullis, C., Wortsman, M., et al. *Laion-5B: An open large-scale dataset for training next generation image-text models*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35, 25278–25294, 2022.

2. **ImageNet Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.J., Li, K., Fei-Fei, L. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248–255, 2009.

3. **MSCOCO Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Chen, X., Fang, H., Lin, T.Y., Vedantam, R., Gupta, S., Dollár, P., Zitnick, C.L. *Microsoft COCO captions: Data collection and evaluation server*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.00325, 2015.

4. **Flickr30K Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Plummer, B.A., Wang, L., Cervantes, C.M., Caicedo, J.C., Hockenmaier, J., Lazebnik, S. *Flickr30k entities: Collecting region-to-phrase correspondences for richer image-to-sentence models*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2641–2649, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the requirements. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
