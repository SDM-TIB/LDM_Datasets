To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Privacy-oriented Manipulation of Speaker Representations" by Francisco Teixeira et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention datasets used for validation. The introduction often elaborates on the datasets and their significance in the context of the research.

Next, I will focus on **section V (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. This section is likely to contain detailed information about each dataset, including their purpose, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, the authors mention four datasets:

1. **VoxCeleb**: A large corpus of recordings from 7,363 speakers, used primarily for speaker recognition tasks. The dataset is composed of short clips taken from interviews uploaded to YouTube.

2. **LibriTTS**: An adaptation of the LibriSpeech corpus, consisting of read speech from audiobooks. It contains 586.5 hours of audio and is used for text-to-speech tasks.

3. **AgeVoxCeleb**: A subset of VoxCeleb that has been annotated with speaker age labels, consisting of 4,976 speakers and 21,707 utterances.

4. **VoxCelebPT**: A Portuguese version of VoxCeleb, containing recordings of Portuguese celebrities, annotated with sex and age labels.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation for easy reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
