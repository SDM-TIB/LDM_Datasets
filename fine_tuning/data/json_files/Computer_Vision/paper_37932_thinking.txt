To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Iris Segmentation Based on Fully Convolutional Networks and Generative Adversarial Networks" by Cides S. Bezerra et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions several datasets used for iris segmentation, specifically highlighting the use of both near-infrared (NIR) and visible (VIS) images. This indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors provide an overview of the datasets, including their characteristics and the number of images. I will carefully note the names of the datasets, the number of images, and any relevant details such as the resolution and the type of images (NIR or VIS).

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **BioSec Dataset**: Contains 3,200 NIR iris images from 25 subjects, but only the first 400 images were used due to available segmentation masks.
2. **CASIA-Iris-Interval-v3 (CasiaI3)**: Comprises 2,639 NIR iris images from 249 subjects, with a resolution of 320 × 280 pixels.
3. **CASIA-Iris-Thousand-v4 (CasiaT4)**: Contains 20,000 NIR images from 1,000 subjects, but only the first 1,000 images from 50 subjects were manually labeled for the experiments.
4. **IITD-1**: A dataset with 2,240 NIR images from 224 subjects, all with a resolution of 320 × 240 pixels.
5. **Cross-Spectral Iris/Periocular (CrEye-Iris)**: Composed of 3,840 images from 120 subjects, with the first 1,000 VIS images from the iris subset being manually labeled.
6. **Iris Challenge Evaluation I Mobile (MICHE-I)**: Contains 3,191 VIS images captured from 92 subjects under uncontrolled settings, with a resolution varying across images.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are:

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference and use in future research or applications.
