To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Intelligent Multi-channel Meta-imagers for Accelerating Machine Vision" by Hanyu Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the classification of **handwritten digits** and **fashion images**, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, where the authors explicitly state that they used the **MNIST** and **Fashion-MNIST** datasets for their experiments. The paper describes the MNIST dataset as containing **60,000 28x28 pixel hand-written digit training images** and the Fashion-MNIST dataset as containing **60,000 training images of clothing articles**.

To confirm the details, I will check the **methods section**, where the authors provide additional context about the datasets used for training their digital neural network. They specify that both datasets consist of 60,000 images, which aligns with the information gathered from the results section.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
   > LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., & Haffner, P. (1998). Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition. *Proceedings of the IEEE*, 86, 2278â€“2323.

2. For the **Fashion-MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
   > Xiao, H., Rasul, K., Vollgraf, R. (2017). Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747*.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or processing.
