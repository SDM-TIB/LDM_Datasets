To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Morphology-Enhanced CAM-Guided SAM for Weakly Supervised Breast Lesion Segmentation" by Xin Yue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **BUSI dataset** for evaluating the proposed method, which indicates that this dataset is significant for the research. The introduction may provide additional context or mention other datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the **experiments and results** section (specifically section 4.1) explicitly describes the datasets used. Here, I find that the authors utilized two datasets:

1. **Breast Ultrasound Image (BUSI) dataset**: This dataset consists of ultrasound images from 600 female patients, categorized into normal, benign, and malignant classes. The paper provides details about the number of images in each category and the process of refining the dataset for their experiments.

2. **Dataset B**: This dataset is referenced as a second breast ultrasound dataset proposed by Yap et al. It contains 163 images with benign and malignant cases, collected using a specific ultrasound system.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **BUSI dataset**, the citation is:
  > W. Al-Dhabyani, M. Gomaa, H. Khaled, and A. Fahmy. "Dataset of breast ultrasound images." *Data in Brief*, 28, p. 104863, 2020.

- For **Dataset B**, the citation is:
  > M. H. Yap, M. Goyal, F. Osman, R. Mart√≠, E. Denton, A. Juette, and R. Zwiggelaar. "Breast ultrasound region of interest detection and lesion localisation." *Artificial Intelligence in Medicine*, 107, p. 101880, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, ensuring to include their names, descriptions, and full citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further studies in the field.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed for future use.
