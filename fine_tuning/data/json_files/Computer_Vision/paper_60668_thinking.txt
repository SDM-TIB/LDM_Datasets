To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Image Completion via Dual-Path Cooperative Filtering" by Pourya Shamsolmoali et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that experiments were conducted on "three challenging image completion datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will proceed to the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the challenges of image completion and mention the need for robust datasets. However, they do not specify the names of the datasets in this section.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will look for a subsection that explicitly lists the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention three datasets: **CelebA-HQ**, **Places2**, and **Paris StreetView**. I will take note of these names and any relevant details provided about them.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the datasets further, stating that they used standard training and testing splits and that the images were at a resolution of 256 × 256. They also mention the use of diverse irregular masks for training and testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are as follows:

1. **CelebA-HQ**:
   > Tero Karras, Timo Aila, Samuli Laine, and Jaakko Lehtinen. *Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability, and Variation*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2017.

2. **Places2**:
   > Bolei Zhou, Agata Lapedriza, Aditya Khosla, Aude Oliva, and Antonio Torralba. *Places: A 10 Million Image Database for Scene Recognition*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 40(6):1452–1464, 2017.

3. **Paris StreetView**:
   > Carl Doersch, Saurabh Singh, Abhinav Gupta, Josef Sivic, and Alexei Efros. *What Makes Paris Look Like Paris?* ACM Transactions on Graphics, 31(4), 2012.

With the dataset names and their corresponding citations in hand, I will summarize the findings:

1. **CelebA-HQ**: A high-quality dataset for facial image generation.
2. **Places2**: A large dataset for scene recognition tasks.
3. **Paris StreetView**: A dataset focused on urban scene understanding.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its full citation, ensuring that all details are accurately captured for future reference or processing.
