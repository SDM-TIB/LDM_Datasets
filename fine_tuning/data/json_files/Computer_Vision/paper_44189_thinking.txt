To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fruit classification using deep feature maps in the presence of deceptive similar classes" by Mohit Dandekar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the **Fruits-360 dataset** is used for evaluation, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.1 (Dataset description)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the Fruits-360 dataset. They mention that it contains **81,120 images of 120 categories of fruits**, with a specific breakdown of how the images were collected and labeled. This section is crucial as it provides both the dataset's purpose and its structure.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Fruits-360 dataset. The paper cites the dataset as follows:

- **Fruits-360 dataset**:
  > Mureşan, H., & Oltean, M. (2018). Fruit recognition from images using deep learning. *Acta Universitatis Sapientiae, Informatica*, 10(1), 26–42.

Since the Fruits-360 dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

Now, I will summarize the dataset details, including its name, description, and citation, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness. This will allow for easy reference and further analysis in future work.
