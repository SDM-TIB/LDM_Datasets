To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SGM-Net: Semantic Guided Matting Net" by Qing Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that they verify their method on the **P3M-10k dataset**, which indicates that this is a key dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. In section 4, the authors describe their experiments and explicitly mention the **P3M-10k dataset**. They state that this dataset contains **9,421 training images and 500 testing images**, which provides important context about the dataset's size and purpose.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The authors reference the P3M-10k dataset as follows:

- **P3M-10k Dataset**: 
  > Li, J., Zhang, J., Maybank, S. J., & Tao, D. (2021). Privacy-preserving portrait matting. In Proceedings of the 29th ACM International Conference on Multimedia (pp. 3501â€“3509).

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **P3M-10k Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed SGM-Net method. It consists of 9,421 training images and 500 testing images, specifically designed for human matting tasks.

With this information, I can now prepare to format the dataset entry according to the required structure, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper attribution. This systematic approach ensures that I have thoroughly extracted all necessary details regarding the dataset from the paper.
