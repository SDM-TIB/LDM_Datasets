To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Unsupervised Clustering with Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoders" by Nat Dilokthanakul et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their model's performance on **synthetic data, MNIST, and SVHN**, which suggests that these datasets are important for the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about the datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of unsupervised clustering and mentions the use of deep generative models, but it does not provide specific dataset details.

I will then focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Synthetic Data**: This dataset is created to mimic the presentation of Johnson et al. (2016), consisting of 10,000 data points generated from the arcs of 5 circles.

2. **MNIST**: The well-known handwritten digits dataset, which includes 60,000 training samples and 10,000 testing samples. The authors reference LeCun et al. (1998) for this dataset.

3. **SVHN**: A dataset of house numbers, specifically the cropped version of the standard and extra training sets, totaling approximately 600,000 images. The authors cite Netzer et al. (2011) for this dataset.

To ensure accuracy, I will check the **References section** for the full citations of these datasets:

- For **Synthetic Data**, since it is a custom dataset based on the work of Johnson et al. (2016), I will cite it as:
  > Johnson, M. J., Duvenaud, D., Wiltschko, A. B., Datta, S. R., & Adams, R. P. (2016). Composing graphical models with neural networks for structured representations and fast inference. arXiv preprint arXiv:1603.06277.

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., & Haffner, P. (1998). Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11), 2278-2324.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Netzer, Y., Wang, T., Coates, A., Bissacco, A., Wu, B., & Ng, A. Y. (2011). Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning. 

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
