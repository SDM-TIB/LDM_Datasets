To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning Guided Graph Neural Networks for Brain Network Analysis" by Xusheng Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the methodology section typically details how the datasets were utilized in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, which is likely to contain a detailed description of the datasets used in the study. In this section, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on **eight brain network disease analysis datasets**. I will look for a table or a list that outlines these datasets, including their characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned in **Table 2**:

1. **BP-DTI**: This dataset consists of brain network instances derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for bipolar disorder, containing 70 subjects (35 healthy and 35 patients). The network is represented as a 82x82 matrix.

2. **BP-fMRI**: This dataset includes functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data for the same subjects as BP-DTI, also represented as a 82x82 matrix.

3. **HIV-DTI**: This dataset contains 70 instances of brain networks from subjects with HIV, with a similar structure to BP-DTI, represented as a 90x90 matrix.

4. **HIV-fMRI**: This dataset includes fMRI data for the same subjects as HIV-DTI, represented as a 90x90 matrix.

5. **ADHD-fMRI**: This dataset consists of fMRI data for subjects diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, represented as a 200x200 matrix.

6. **HI-fMRI**: This dataset includes fMRI data for subjects with Hyperactive Impulsive Disorder, also represented as a 200x200 matrix.

7. **GD-fMRI**: This dataset consists of fMRI data for gender classification, represented as a 200x200 matrix.

8. **HA-EEG**: This dataset includes electroencephalogram (EEG) data recorded from 61 healthy adults, represented as a 68x68 matrix.

Next, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets. The paper cites the sources for the datasets as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
