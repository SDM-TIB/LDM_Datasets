To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretable Models for Understanding Immersive Simulations" by Nicholas Hoernle et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves logs from an immersive simulation, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to the simulation's data.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention specific datasets or provide context about the data used in their experiments. The introduction references "Connected Worlds (CW)," which is described as an ecological simulation used for educational purposes. This hints that the dataset may be related to the interactions within this simulation.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in sections discussing the "Connected Worlds Domain" and "Modeling Studentsâ€™ Activities in CW," I will look for explicit mentions of datasets. The paper describes the time series data recorded during the CW sessions, which includes water levels in different biomes over time. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm the use of the CW dataset and to gather any additional details about its structure or characteristics. The paper mentions that the output of a CW session is a time series recording the levels of water in the different biomes for 8 minutes at a 1Hz frequency. This provides specific information about the dataset's temporal resolution and content.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned in the paper. The authors reference several studies and datasets, including the original work on the Connected Worlds simulation.

Based on this analysis, I will compile the relevant datasets and their citations:

1. **Connected Worlds Dataset**: This dataset consists of time series data from the Connected Worlds simulation, capturing the levels of water in various biomes over time as students interact with the simulation.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
