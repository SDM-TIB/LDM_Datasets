To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Apparent Diffusion Coefficient Maps from Accelerated Radial k-Space Diffusion-Weighted MRI in Mice using a Deep CNN-Transformer Model" by Yuemeng Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the model was trained on DWI data of **147 mice** and evaluated on **36 mice**, which indicates that there are datasets related to these animal studies.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Methods)**, specifically **subsection 2.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors describe the animal handling protocols and the specifics of the MRI scans. They mention that the study employed a genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, which provides context for the dataset used.

In this section, the authors detail the number of scans and slices used for training and testing:
- **Training dataset**: 147 animals with a total of 2255 slices.
- **Testing dataset**: 36 animals with a total of 557 slices.

The paper also mentions that the dataset can be downloaded from a specific URL, which is a crucial piece of information for citation.

Now, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, as it is likely a proprietary or institutional dataset. Instead, the authors provide a link to the dataset, which I will include in the dataset entry.

The relevant datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **DWI Data for Training**: This dataset consists of diffusion-weighted imaging data collected from 147 genetically engineered mice, used to train the DeepADC-Net model.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided, but the dataset can be accessed at [Penn Pancreatic Cancer Imaging Resource](https://pennpancreaticcancerimagingresource.github.io/data.html).

2. **DWI Data for Testing**: This dataset consists of diffusion-weighted imaging data collected from 36 genetically engineered mice, used to evaluate the performance of the model.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided, but the dataset can be accessed at [Penn Pancreatic Cancer Imaging Resource](https://pennpancreaticcancerimagingresource.github.io/data.html).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the relevant citations and links for each dataset as required. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented for future reference or use in related research.
