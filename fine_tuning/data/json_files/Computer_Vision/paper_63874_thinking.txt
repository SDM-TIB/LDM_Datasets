To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data-iterative Optimization Score Model for Stable Ultra-Sparse-View CT Reconstruction" by Weiwen Wu and Yanyang Wang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using **numerical and clinical cardiac datasets**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the study.

Next, I will look for specific details about the datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors mention using a **simulated dataset from the AAPM 2016 CT Low Dose Challenge** for training and testing, which consists of clinical data from nine patients (4,000 slices for training and 400 slices for testing). This dataset is essential for understanding the performance of their proposed method.

Additionally, the authors refer to **real clinical cardiac datasets** used in their experiments. They provide some details about the scanning geometry and the characteristics of the cardiac datasets, which include a total of 880 individual units and a complete scan composed of 2200 views.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **AAPM 2016 CT Low Dose Challenge**, the citation is:
   > AAPM. *AAPM 2016 CT Low Dose Challenge*. Available: https://ctcicblog.mayo.edu/2016-low-dose-ct-grand-challenge/.

2. For the **clinical cardiac datasets**, the citation is:
   > Xu, Q., Yu, H., Mou, X., Zhang, L., Hsieh, J., & Wang, G. (2012). Low-dose x-ray ct reconstruction via dictionary learning. *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 31(9), 1682-1697.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
