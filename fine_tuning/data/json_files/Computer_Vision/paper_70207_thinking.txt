To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ComS2T: A complementary spatiotemporal learning system for data-adaptive model evolution" by Zhengyang Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of spatiotemporal learning and mention various applications, but I need to look for specific datasets. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for validation. In this paper, the authors present a table (Table II) that summarizes the statistics of the datasets used in their experiments. The datasets listed include:

1. **SIP (Traffic)**: This dataset consists of traffic volumes captured in Suzhou Industry Park, with 108 nodes and 25,920 time steps, covering the period from January 1, 2017, to March 31, 2017, with a 5-minute interval length.

2. **Metr-LA (Traffic)**: This dataset includes traffic attributes such as speed, detected by highway loop detectors in Los Angeles, USA. It has 207 nodes and 34,272 time steps, covering the period from March 1, 2012, to June 30, 2012, also with a 5-minute interval length.

3. **KnowAir (Air quality)**: This dataset contains PM2.5 concentrations across 184 main cities in China, with 184 nodes and 11,688 time steps, covering the period from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2018, with a 3-hour interval length.

4. **Temperature (Climate)**: This dataset includes urban numerical temperature data for the same 184 cities as KnowAir, with similar statistics (184 nodes, 11,688 time steps, and a 3-hour interval length).

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. The paper cites the sources for the datasets used, which is crucial for proper attribution.

For the **SIP dataset**, the citation is:

For the **Metr-LA dataset**, the citation is:

For the **KnowAir dataset**, the citation is:

For the **Temperature dataset**, the citation is:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing.
