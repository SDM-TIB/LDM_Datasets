To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Vision Transformers as Diffusion Learners" by He Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved competitive results on several datasets, which indicates that multiple datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about their use in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I identify the following datasets mentioned:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.

2. **CelebA**: The paper mentions two resolutions of this dataset:
   - **CelebA 64 × 64**: A version of the CelebA dataset resized to 64x64 pixels, used for generating images of celebrity faces.
   - **CelebA 128 × 128**: Another version of the CelebA dataset resized to 128x128 pixels.

3. **LSUN (Large-scale Scene Understanding)**: The authors refer to this dataset in the context of generating images of various scenes, specifically mentioning the **Church** category at a resolution of 256 × 256.

4. **CC12M (Conceptual 12M)**: This dataset is used for text-to-image generation tasks and contains approximately 12 million image-text pairs.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: Canadian Institute for Advanced Research*. 2009.

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3730–3738, 2015.

- For **LSUN**, the citation is:
  > Fisher Yu, Ari Seff, Yinda Zhang, Shuran Song, Thomas Funkhouser, and Jianxiong Xiao. *LSUN: Construction of a Large-scale Image Dataset using Deep Learning with Humans in the Loop*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.03365, 2015.

- For **CC12M**, the citation is:
  > Soravit Changpinyo, Piyush Sharma, Nan Ding, and Radu Soricut. *Conceptual 12M: Pushing Web-Scale Image-Text Pre-Training To Recognize Long-Tail Visual Concepts*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3558–3568, 2021.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further research and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
