To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Isotropic Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering" by Yuanhao Gong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed method but does not specify any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the 3D Gaussian splatting method and its applications but still lacks specific dataset references.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, there is no dedicated section labeled "Datasets," so I will look for any mentions of datasets within the text of the methodology or experiments.

As I read through the paper, I will pay close attention to any figures, tables, or references that might indicate the use of specific datasets. If the authors mention any datasets in the context of their experiments or comparisons, I will note them down.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial, as I need to provide complete and accurate citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

If I find any datasets, I will ensure to extract the following information for each:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of what the dataset contains and its relevance to the research.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset as it appears in the References section of the paper.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited. This will allow for easy reference and validation of the datasets used in the research.

In summary, my approach will involve:
1. Reading the abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections for dataset mentions.
2. Noting any datasets found and their descriptions.
3. Retrieving full citations from the References section.
4. Compiling the information in a clear and organized manner.
