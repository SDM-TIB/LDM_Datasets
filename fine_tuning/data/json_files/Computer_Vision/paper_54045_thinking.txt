To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model Degradation Hinders Deep Graph Neural Networks" by Wentao Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments on "six real-world datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using datasets like **Cora**, **Citeseer**, and **PubMed** for their experiments. I will note down these names and any relevant details provided about each dataset.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a table summarizing the datasets used, including the number of nodes, features, edges, classes, and the train/validation/test splits. This information is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of each dataset.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

1. **Cora Dataset**:
   > Zhilin Yang, William Cohen, and Ruslan Salakhudinov. *Revisiting semi-supervised learning with graph embeddings*. In Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2016.

2. **Citeseer Dataset**:
   > Prithviraj Sen, Galileo Namata, Mustafa Bilgic, Lise Getoor, Brian Gallagher, and Tina Eliassi-Rad. *Collective Classification in Network Data*. AI Magazine, 29(3):93â€“106, 2008.

3. **PubMed Dataset**:
   > Yang, Z., Cohen, W. W., & Salakhudinov, R. (2016). *Revisiting semi-supervised learning with graph embeddings*. In Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2016.

4. **ogbn-arxiv Dataset**:
   > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). *Open Graph Benchmark: Datasets for Machine Learning on Graphs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.00687.

5. **ogbn-products Dataset**:
   > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). *Open Graph Benchmark: Datasets for Machine Learning on Graphs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.00687.

6. **ogbn-papers100M Dataset**:
   > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). *Open Graph Benchmark: Datasets for Machine Learning on Graphs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.00687.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
