To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GaussNav: Gaussian Splatting for Visual Navigation" by Xiaohan Lei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) dataset**, indicating that this is a key dataset for the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they use the **Habitat-Matterport 3D dataset (HM3D)** for their experiments. They describe the dataset as consisting of scenes that are 3D reconstructions of real-world environments with semantic annotations, and they provide details about the splits for training, validation, and testing.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the HM3D dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> Yadav, K., Ramrakhya, R., Ramakrishnan, S.K., Gervet, T., Turner, J., Gokaslan, A., Maestre, N., Chang, A.X., Batra, D., Savva, M., et al. *Habitat-Matterport 3D Semantics Dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 4927â€“4936, 2023.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the HM3D dataset, I will ensure to document this dataset thoroughly. 

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation as required. This will allow for clear and organized presentation of the dataset information extracted from the paper.
