To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convolution and Attention-Free Mamba-based Cardiac Image Segmentation" by Abbas Khan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental validation sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often highlights the significance of the datasets used. The methodology and experimental validation sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of image segmentation in cardiac analysis, which suggests that they likely used specific datasets for their experiments. I will look for any mentions of datasets or challenges that might indicate the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental validation section**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset they used for their experiments. Here, they state that they used the segmentation data from the **CMR×Recon MICCAI-2023 challenge**. They describe the dataset as containing multi-contrast, multi-view, multi-slice, and multi-coil cardiac magnetic resonance imaging data from 300 subjects, specifically using the 4CH-LAX cine images and corresponding segmentation labels.

Now, I will gather the full citation for this dataset from the **References section**. The relevant citation for the CMR×Recon dataset is:

- **CMR×Recon Dataset**: 
  > Chengyan Wang, Jun Lyu, Shuo Wang, Chen Qin, Kunyuan Guo, Xinyu Zhang, Xiaotong Yu, Yan Li, Fanwen Wang, Jianhua Jin, et al. *CMRXRecon: An Open Cardiac MRI Dataset for the Competition of Accelerated Image Reconstruction*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2309.10836, 2023.

After identifying the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset's details, including its purpose, the number of subjects, and the types of images included.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference in future research. This will ensure that the dataset extraction is thorough and accurate, ready for any further processing or analysis.
