To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-Time Construction Algorithm of Co-Occurrence Network Based on Inverted Index" by Jiahao Cheng, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the **CSL (Chinese Scientific Literature) dataset** is used for experimental validation. This is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will delve into the **introduction** and **experiment sections** to gather more details about the dataset. In the introduction, the paper discusses the importance of co-occurrence networks and mentions the use of datasets in the context of algorithm performance. However, it is in the **experiment section** that I find a detailed description of the dataset.

In **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, the paper provides a comprehensive overview of the **CSL dataset**. It states that the dataset consists of **396,209 Chinese core journal papers’ metadata**, including titles, abstracts, keywords, disciplines, and categories. The dataset covers journal papers published from **2010 to 2020** and is categorized into **13 categories and 67 disciplines**.

The paper also notes that due to constraints, a subset of the dataset was used, specifically focusing on the categories "Library, Information, and Archive Management" and "Journalism and Communication." This information is crucial for understanding the context in which the dataset was utilized.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CSL dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **CSL dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. Li, Y. Zhang, and et al., “CSL: A large-scale Chinese scientific literature dataset,” in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, (Gyeongju, Republic of Korea), pp. 3917–3923, International Committee on Computational Linguistics, Oct. 2022.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset details and prepare to format them according to the required structure.

In summary, I have identified the dataset as follows:
1. **CSL Dataset**: A large-scale dataset containing metadata of 396,209 Chinese core journal papers, covering various disciplines and published between 2010 and 2020.

I will now compile this information into the appropriate format for further processing.
