To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mixed Prototype Consistency Learning for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation" by Lijian Li, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on the **left atrium and type B aortic dissection datasets**, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Metrics)**, where the author provides detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **Left Atrium (LA) Dataset**: This dataset consists of 100 3D gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging volumes, with a spatial resolution of 0.625×0.625×0.625 mm³. The dataset is split into 80 samples for training and 20 for validation, with specific cropping and inference techniques mentioned.

2. **Type B Aortic Dissection (TBAD) Dataset**: This dataset includes 124 computed tomography angiography scans, annotated for three regions: whole aorta, true lumen, and false lumen. The dataset is divided into 100 scans for training and 24 for testing, with preprocessing techniques referenced.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Left Atrium Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xiong, Z., Xia, Q., Hu, Z., Huang, N., Bian, C., Zheng, Y., Vesal, S., Ravikumar, N., Maier, A.K., Yang, X., Heng, P., Ni, D., Li, C., Tong, Q., Si, W., Puybareau, É., Khoudli, Y., Géraud, T., Zhao, J. (2021). *A global benchmark of algorithms for segmenting the left atrium from late gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging*. Medical Image Analysis, 67, 101832. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2020.101832.

- For the **TBAD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yao, Z., Xie, W., Zhang, J., Dong, Y., Qiu, H., Yuan, H., Jia, Q., Wang, T., Shi, Y., Zhuang, J., et al. (2021). *Imagetbad: A 3D computed tomography angiography image dataset for automatic segmentation of type-b aortic dissection*. Frontiers in Physiology, 12, 732711. 

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
