To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Enhanced Hybrid MobileNet" by Hong-Yen Chen and Chung-Yen Su, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions experimental results on the **CIFAR database**, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will note this down as a potential dataset.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this case, the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on the **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets. I will gather details about these datasets, including their characteristics and any relevant information provided in the paper.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the CIFAR-10 dataset as consisting of images drawn from 10 classes, and the CIFAR-100 dataset as containing images from 100 classes. They mention that the training and test sets for CIFAR-10 contain 50,000 and 10,000 images, respectively, without any data augmentation. This information is crucial for describing the datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are typically attributed to the original papers that introduced them:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
