To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Building Socially-Equitable Public Models" by Yejia Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors released "codes and datasets" at a specific GitHub link, which indicates that datasets are indeed part of the research. The introduction discusses the importance of public models and their applications, hinting at the use of various datasets for training and evaluation.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** section, particularly in **Section 5**, where the authors describe their empirical case studies. Here, they mention two applications: carbon efficiency in data centers and scheduled EV charging for environmental sustainability. Each application includes references to specific datasets.

1. **State-level Energy Fuel Mix Dataset**: This dataset is used in the data centers application. It is sourced from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and provides information on various energy sources utilized in electricity generation.

   Citation:
   > U.S. Energy Information Administration. *Electricity – consumption of fuels used to generate electricity*. URL: https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data.php.

2. **Azure Cloud Workload Dataset**: This dataset captures the energy consumption/demand patterns of the cloud center across different time periods and is referenced in the same application.

   Citation:
   > Shahrad, M., Fonseca, R., Íñigo Goiri, Chaudhry, G., Batum, P., Cooke, J., Laureano, E., Tresness, C., Russinovich, M., and Bianchini, R. *Serverless in the wild: Characterizing and optimizing the serverless workload at a large cloud provider*. In Proceedings of the 2020 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC), 2020.

3. **ACN-Data**: This dataset is used in the EV charging application and records real-time charging details, including EV arrival/departure times and actual energy delivered in each charging session.

   Citation:
   > Lee, Z., Li, T., and Low, S. *ACN-Data: Analysis and applications of an open EV charging dataset*. In Proceedings of the 2019 ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2019.

4. **California Electricity Market (CAISO)**: This dataset provides data on electricity prices in California, which is utilized in the EV charging application.

   Citation:
   > California ISO. *California ISO - Market Price Maps*. URL: http://www.caiso.com/pricemap/Pages/default.aspx.

5. **National Household Travel Survey (NHTS)**: This dataset is used to approximate the available charging time window for residential EVs.

   Citation:
   > U.S. Department of Transportation. *Federal Highway Administration. National Household Travel Survey, 2017*. URL: http://nhts.ornl.gov.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for each one, as they are crucial for proper attribution and further research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing.
