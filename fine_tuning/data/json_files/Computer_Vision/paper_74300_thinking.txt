To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How to Distinguish AI-Generated Images from Authentic Photographs" by Negar Kamali et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors generated **138 images with diffusion models**, curated **9 images from social media**, and curated **42 real photographs**. This indicates that there are specific datasets involved, and I need to gather more details about them.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors do not have a specific section titled "Datasets," but they do provide information about the images they generated and curated throughout the text.

I will note the following datasets:

1. **AI-Generated Images**: The authors generated **138 images** using various diffusion models, including Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and Firefly. These images are used to illustrate the artifacts and implausibilities in AI-generated content.

2. **Curated Social Media Images**: The authors curated **9 images from social media** that exemplify AI-generated images. The specific sources of these images are not detailed in the text, so I will need to acknowledge that they are curated but not explicitly cited.

3. **Real Photographs**: The authors curated **42 real photographs**. They specifically mention two real photographs: one of a Ukrainian serviceman from The Atlantic and another taken by Oleg S on Flickr. I will need to find the full citations for these photographs.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **Ukrainian serviceman photograph**:
  > The Atlantic. *Faces of Ukraine, April 2022*. Retrieved from [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com).

- For the **photo taken by Oleg S**:
  > Oleg S. *Matching colors*. November 2016. Retrieved from [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com).

Since the AI-generated images and curated social media images do not have specific citations, I will note them as datasets without full citations.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified and that full citations are provided where applicable. This will help in documenting the datasets for further analysis or reference.
