To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Localize: A 3D CNN Approach to User Positioning in Massive MIMO-OFDM Systems" by Chi Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a new type of fingerprint called the angle-delay channel power matrix (ADCPM) used for user positioning, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this fingerprint.

Next, I will examine **section II (3D MIMO-OFDM System and Channel Characteristics)**, where the authors describe the ADCPM in detail. They mention that the ADCPM is derived from channel state information (CSI) and is used as a fingerprint for positioning. However, I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

In **section V (Simulation Results)**, the authors describe their simulation setup and mention that they generated fingerprints and corresponding 3D positions using MATLAB. They also refer to a simulator based on the QuaDriGa model, which is crucial for understanding the datasets used.

I will also check the **References section** for any citations related to datasets or models that were utilized in their experiments. The references may include foundational works or datasets that are critical for reproducing their results.

After reviewing the paper, I will compile the datasets identified:

1. **ADCPM Dataset**: This dataset is generated from the channel state information (CSI) and is used for training the 3D CNN model. The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, as it is derived from their simulations.

2. **QuaDriGa Model**: The authors mention using the QuaDriGa model for their simulations. The citation for this model is:
   > S. Jaeckel, L. Raschkowski, K. Borner, and L. Thiele. "QuaDRiGa: A 3-D multi-cell channel model with time evolution for enabling virtual field trials." IEEE Trans. Antennas Propag., vol. 62, no. 6, pp. 3242â€“3256, June 2014.

3. **3D Positioning Dataset**: The authors generated a dataset of 3D positions corresponding to the fingerprints collected during the simulation. This dataset is not explicitly cited but is based on the simulation setup described in the paper.

Now, I will ensure that I have the full citations for the datasets and models mentioned, as this is crucial for proper attribution and reproducibility in research.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference in future work.
