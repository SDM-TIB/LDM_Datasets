To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diverse Branch Block: Building a Convolution as an Inception-like Unit" by Xiaohan Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses improvements in performance on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets, Architectures and Configurations)**, where the authors typically provide details about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant statistics.

In this section, the authors mention using several datasets for their experiments:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

2. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset for image classification containing over 1.2 million images across 1,000 classes.

3. **Cityscapes**: A dataset for semantic urban scene understanding, consisting of high-resolution images with pixel-level annotations for various classes.

4. **COCO (Common Objects in Context)**: A dataset for object detection, segmentation, and captioning, containing over 330,000 images with more than 2.5 million labeled instances.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet**:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009. CVPR 2009. IEEE Conference on, pages 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

- For **Cityscapes**:
  > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, CVPR 2016, pages 3213–3223. IEEE Computer Society, 2016.

- For **COCO**:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollar, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft coco: Common objects in context*. In European conference on computer vision, pages 740–755. Springer, 2014.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
