To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Streaming Networks: Enable A Robust Classification of Noise-Corrupted Images" by Sergey Tarasenko and Fumihiko Takahashi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but I need to look for specific dataset names and details.

In the **experiments section (Section 4)**, the authors state that they used three datasets for their experiments. This is a strong indication that I will find the dataset names and descriptions here.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset contains RGB images of size 32x32 across 10 classes (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck), totaling 60,000 images with 50,000 for training and 10,000 for testing.

2. **Eurosat (RGB)**: This dataset consists of Sentinel-2 satellite images covering 13 spectral bands and RGB images of size 64x64, with a total of 27,000 labeled and geo-referenced images across 10 classes (AnnualCrop, Forest, HerbaceousVegetation, Highway, Industrial, Pasture, PermanentCrop, Residential, River, SeaLake).

3. **UC Merced Land Use**: This dataset contains 256x256 RGB satellite images representing 21 classes of land use, with 100 images for each class.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton. *ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2012.

- For **Eurosat**, the citation is:
  > P. Helber, B. Bischke, A. Dengel, and D. Borth. *EuroSAT: A Novel Dataset and Deep Learning Benchmark for Land Use and Land Cover Classification*. IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 12, 2217-2226, 2017.

- For **UC Merced Land Use**, the citation is:
  > UC Merced Land Use Dataset. Available at: http://weegee.vision.ucmerced.edu/datasets/landuse.html.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
