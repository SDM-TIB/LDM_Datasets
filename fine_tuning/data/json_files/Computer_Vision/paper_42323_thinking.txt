To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Limited-Capacity Minimax Theorem for Non-Convex Games" by Gauthier Gidel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses adversarial training and mentions applications in games like StarCraft II and Poker, which may imply the use of datasets related to these games.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** to identify any datasets used for validation or testing. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note them down.

In the **related work section**, I will look for any references to datasets used in previous studies that may be relevant to the current research. This could provide context or additional datasets that the authors might have utilized.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset like the "StarCraft II Learning Environment," I will look for the original paper or source that describes this dataset and note its full citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurately reflects the information provided in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for any required output format, ensuring that they are ready for review or further processing.
