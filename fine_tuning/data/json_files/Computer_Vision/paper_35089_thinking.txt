To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalized Zero-Shot Learning via Synthesized Examples" by Vinay Kumar Verma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on several benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 6 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets they evaluated their model on, which are:

1. **Animals with Attributes (AwA)**: The paper mentions two versions of this dataset, AwA1 and AwA2, with specific details about the number of images and class splits.

2. **SUN Scene Recognition**: This dataset is described in terms of the number of scenes and the split between seen and unseen classes.

3. **Caltech UCSD Birds 200 (CUB)**: The authors provide details about the number of classes and images, as well as the class splits.

4. **Imagenet**: The paper discusses the setup for evaluating zero-shot classification accuracy on this large-scale dataset.

In this section, I will also take note of any statistics provided for each dataset, such as the number of images, the number of seen/unseen classes, and any specific attributes associated with the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Animals with Attributes (AwA)**, the citation is:
  > Lampert, C. H., Nickisch, H., & Harmeling, S. (2009). Learning to detect unseen object classes by between-class attribute transfer. In *Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009. CVPR 2009. IEEE Conference on* (pp. 951-958). IEEE.

- For **SUN Scene Recognition**, the citation is:
  > Xiao, J., Hays, J., Ehinger, K. A., Oliva, A., & Torralba, A. (2010). Sun database: Large-scale scene recognition from abbey to zoo. In *CVPR 2010* (pp. 3485-3492). IEEE.

- For **Caltech UCSD Birds 200 (CUB)**, the citation is:
  > Welinder, P., Branson, S., Mita, T., Wah, C., Schroff, F., Belongie, S., & Perona, P. (2010). Caltech-UCSD Birds 200. 

- For **Imagenet**, the citation is:
  > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M. S., Berg, A. C., & Li, F. (2015). Imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge. *International Journal of Computer Vision*, 115(3), 211-252.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their citations into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
