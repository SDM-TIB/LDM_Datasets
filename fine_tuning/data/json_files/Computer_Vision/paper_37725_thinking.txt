To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Distributed Coevolutionary GANs" by Abdullah Al-Dujaili et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and mentions experiments conducted on commonly used image-generation datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In the **experiments section**, the authors state that they conducted experiments on two different datasets: **MNIST** and **CelebA**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are relevant to their research.

I will then gather detailed descriptions of these datasets from the text. The paper mentions:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is widely used for handwritten digit recognition and consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9). It is particularly suitable for demonstrating mode collapse due to its limited target space.

2. **CelebA Dataset**: This dataset contains over 200,000 images of more than 10,000 celebrities' faces. It is used to show the ability of the proposed method to generate diverse images and to illustrate the challenges of mode collapse in GANs.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun. The MNIST database of handwritten digits, 1998.

- For the **CelebA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Liu et al. Deep learning face attributes in the wild. In ICCV, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its full citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented for future reference or analysis.
