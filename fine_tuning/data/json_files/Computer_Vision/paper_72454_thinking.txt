To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fisher Information Improved Training-Free Conditional Diffusion Model" by Kaiyu Song and Hanjiang Lai, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which suggests that datasets are likely used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe the tasks and datasets used. In this section, they mention using specific datasets for their experiments, which is crucial for my extraction process.

1. **CelebA-HQ Dataset**: The authors state that they used the unconditional human face diffusion model pre-trained on the CelebA-HQ dataset. This dataset is significant for face-related tasks and is mentioned explicitly.

2. **Stable Diffusion V1.4**: The paper discusses the use of Stable Diffusion for style-guided generation tasks. While this is a model rather than a dataset, it is important to note the context in which it is used.

3. **ControlNet**: The authors mention using ControlNet for generating images based on multiple guidance conditions. They refer to datasets related to face ID images and style images, but specific dataset names are not provided.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. 

- For the **CelebA-HQ Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3730–3738, 2015.

- The **Stable Diffusion** model is referenced in the context of its original paper:
  > Robin Rombach, Andreas Blattmann, Dominik Lorenz, Patrick Esser, and Björn Ommer. *High-resolution image synthesis with latent diffusion models*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 10684–10695, 2022.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
