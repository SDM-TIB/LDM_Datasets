To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "EgoDistill: Egocentric Head Motion Distillation for Efficient Video Understanding" by Shuhan Tan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method's effectiveness on the **Ego4D** and **EPIC-Kitchens** datasets, indicating that these are the primary datasets used in their research.

Next, I will delve into the **experiments section** (Section 4) to gather more specific information about these datasets. In **Section 4.1**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of both datasets:

1. **Ego4D**: This dataset contains 3,670 hours of egocentric videos of people performing various tasks, constructed with annotations from the Hands+Objects temporal localization benchmark. It includes clips with paired IMU and audio, resulting in a 94-class action recognition dataset with 8.5k training videos and 3.6k evaluation videos.

2. **EPIC-Kitchens**: This dataset consists of 100 hours of egocentric videos capturing daily activities in kitchen environments. The authors use annotations from the action recognition benchmark, resulting in a 62-class action dataset with 29k training videos and 6.2k evaluation videos.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Ego4D**, the citation is:
  > Kristen Grauman et al. "Ego4D: Around the World in 3,000 Hours of Egocentric Video." In IEEE/CVF Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2022.

- For **EPIC-Kitchens**, the citation is:
  > Dima Damen et al. "Rescaling egocentric vision: Collection, pipeline and challenges for epic-kitchens-100." International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 130:33â€“55, 2022.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
