To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Learning of Lagrangian Dynamics from Images for Prediction and Control" by Yaofeng Desmond Zhong and Naomi Ehrich Leonard, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** to find detailed descriptions of the datasets. In particular, I will focus on any sections that discuss the training setup or data generation processes, as these often contain information about the datasets used.

In the **results section**, I will look for any references to datasets used for validation or testing, as well as any performance metrics that might indicate the datasets' characteristics.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. This is crucial for ensuring that I have the correct and complete information about each dataset.

For this paper, I anticipate that the authors may have used datasets generated from simulations, specifically from the OpenAI Gym simulator, as mentioned in the supplementary materials. I will confirm this by looking for any specific dataset names or descriptions in the text.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will involve formatting the citations according to academic standards, ensuring that all authors, titles, publication venues, and years are accurately represented.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear and organized manner, ready for further processing or review.
