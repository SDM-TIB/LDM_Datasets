To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distinguishable Cash, Bosonic Bitcoin, and Fermionic Non-fungible Token" by Zae Young Kim and Jeong-Hyuck Park, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for analysis or comparison.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and results sections** to see if the authors describe any specific datasets they used for their analysis. This is crucial as it often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their sources, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **discussion section**, the authors may refer to real data or datasets that they call for verification against. This could include datasets related to wealth distribution, cryptocurrency transactions, or economic statistics.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors reference the Bitcoin dataset, I will look for the original source or paper that describes this dataset in detail. Similarly, if they mention any economic datasets, I will find the corresponding citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as it appears in the references section of the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear and concise manner, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for further processing or review.
