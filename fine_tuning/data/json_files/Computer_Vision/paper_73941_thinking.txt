To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mathematical Methods for Assessing the Accuracy of Pre-Planned and Guided Surgical Osteotomies" by George R. Nahass et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methodologies developed, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the fibula-free flap (FFF) technique and its applications in maxillofacial surgery, but again, there are no specific datasets mentioned. I will continue to the **methods section** where the authors describe their study design and data preprocessing steps.

In **section 2.1 (Study Design)**, the authors mention that they analyzed both pre and post-operative scans to compare surgical planning accuracy. They specify that a **preoperative CT scan** of a patient was collected, along with **post-operative CT scans**. However, they do not provide a formal dataset name or citation for these scans.

Next, I will check the **results section** to see if any datasets are referenced. The results primarily focus on the methodologies and findings rather than specific datasets. 

Finally, I will examine the **references section** to see if any external datasets are cited. The references primarily consist of studies and articles related to surgical techniques and methodologies, but they do not explicitly mention datasets that could be extracted.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets with formal names or citations, I will summarize the findings regarding the data used in the study:

1. **Preoperative CT Scans**: The authors utilized a preoperative CT scan of a 59-year-old male patient presenting with squamous cell carcinoma. However, no citation is provided for this dataset.

2. **Postoperative CT Scans**: Post-operative CT scans were also analyzed, but again, no formal dataset name or citation is provided.

In conclusion, while the paper discusses the use of CT scans for analysis, it does not provide specific datasets with citations that can be extracted. Therefore, I will note that there are no formal datasets available for citation in this research paper.
