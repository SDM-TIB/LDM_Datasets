To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Synthetic Data from Diffusion Models Improves Drug Discovery Prediction" by Bing Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of synthetic data generated by the Syngand model for downstream regression tasks with specific datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present. The introduction further elaborates on the challenges in drug discovery data and mentions the need for datasets like AqSolDB, LD50, and hERG Central.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** section, particularly the parts where the authors describe their model training and the datasets used. Here, they explicitly state that the model is trained on 1.3 million ligands collected from Guacamol and the target property datasets AqSolDB, LD50, and hERG Central. This confirms the datasets used in their experiments.

In the **results** section, the authors discuss the performance of their model using the generated synthetic data in relation to these datasets, which reinforces their importance in the study.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **references section**:

1. **AqSolDB**: 
   > Murat Cihan Sorkun, Abhishek Khetan, and Süleyman Er. *Aqsoldb, a curated reference set of aqueous solubility and 2d descriptors for a diverse set of compounds*. Scientific Data, 6(1):143, 2019.

2. **LD50**: 
   > Hao Zhu, Todd M Martin, Lin Ye, Alexander Sedykh, Douglas M Young, and Alexander Tropsha. *Quantitative structure-activity relationship modeling of rat acute toxicity by oral exposure*. Chemical Research in Toxicology, 22(12):1913–1921, 2009.

3. **hERG Central**: 
   > Fang Du, Haibo Yu, Beiyan Zou, Joseph Babcock, Shunyou Long, and Min Li. *Hergcentral: a large database to store, retrieve, and analyze compound-human ether-a-go-go related gene channel interactions to facilitate cardiotoxicity assessment in drug development*. Assay and Drug Development Technologies, 9(6):580–588, 2011.

After compiling this information, I will summarize the datasets, including their descriptions and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
