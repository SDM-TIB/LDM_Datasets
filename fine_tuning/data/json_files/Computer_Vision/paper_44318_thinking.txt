To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Social & Engaging Peer Learning: Predicting Backchanneling and Disengagement in Children" by Mononito Goswami et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. In this case, the authors discuss the development of models for predicting listener disengagement and backchanneling, which suggests that they likely used specific datasets for their analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsection titled **"Dataset."** Here, the authors describe the P2PSTORY dataset, which is crucial for their experiments. They detail how the dataset was collected, including the number of participants, the nature of the storytelling tasks, and the types of data collected (e.g., video and audio recordings).

The P2PSTORY dataset is described as follows:
- It includes data from **eighteen children** aged approximately **5.22 years**, who participated in storytelling tasks. The dataset consists of **29 sessions** and **58 storytelling episodes**, with various socio-demographic parameters collected for analysis.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the P2PSTORY dataset. The authors reference a related work by Singh et al. (2018) that provides further details about the dataset. The citation for this dataset is:
> Singh, N., Lee, J. J., Grover, I., & Breazeal, C. (2018). P2PSTORY: Dataset of children as storytellers and listeners in peer-to-peer interactions. In Proceedings of the 2018 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '18), 434:1â€“434:11. ACM. DOI: 10.1145/3173574.3174008.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details, including the full citation, ensuring that I adhere to the importance of providing complete references for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
