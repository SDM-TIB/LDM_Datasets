To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Art or Artifice? Large Language Models and the False Promise of Creativity" by Tuhin Chakrabarty et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a benchmark consisting of **48 short stories** for evaluating creativity, which indicates that there is a dataset involved. The introduction further elaborates on the **Torrance Test for Creative Writing (TTCW)** and its application to these stories, suggesting that the dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. The **Methods** or **Data Selection** sections are likely to provide comprehensive information about the datasets. In this paper, the authors describe the selection of **12 short stories from The New Yorker**, which were paired with **36 stories generated by three large language models (LLMs)**, resulting in a total of **48 stories** for evaluation.

I will then extract the relevant details about the datasets:

1. **New Yorker Stories**: The paper lists **12 short stories** from The New Yorker, which serve as the human-written benchmark. Each story is accompanied by a one-sentence plot summary. This dataset is crucial for comparing human creativity against LLM-generated content.

2. **LLM-Generated Stories**: The authors generated **36 stories** using three different LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Claude V1.3) based on the plot summaries of the New Yorker stories. This dataset is essential for evaluating the performance of LLMs in creative writing.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. Since the New Yorker stories are from a well-known publication, I will cite them as follows:

- For the **New Yorker stories**, I will reference the publication itself:
  > The New Yorker. Various authors. *Short Stories Collection*. Retrieved from https://www.newyorker.com/tag/short-stories.

- For the **LLM-generated stories**, I will cite the models used:
  > OpenAI. (2022). *ChatGPT: Optimizing language models for dialogue*. Retrieved from https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/.
  > OpenAI. (2023). *GPT-4 Technical Report*. ArXiv abs/2303.08774.
  > Anthropic. (2022). *Introducing Claude*. Retrieved from https://www.anthropic.com/index/introducing-claude.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper, along with their full citations, which is essential for academic integrity and reproducibility.
