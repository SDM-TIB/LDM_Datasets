To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GCN-MIF: Graph Convolutional Network with Multi-Information Fusion for Low-dose CT Denoising" by Kecheng Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a "public clinical dataset" used for validation, which suggests that there is a dataset that needs to be detailed.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically section III (Experiments), where the authors discuss the datasets used. In this section, they mention the following datasets:

1. **NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Grand Challenge Dataset**: This dataset includes 10 patients' abdominal examinations obtained on similar scanner models. The authors specify that the normal-dose CT images are acquired under specific settings, and the low-dose counterparts are simulated to reach a certain noise level. They also provide a link for more information about the dataset.

2. **LDCT-PD Dataset**: This dataset is used for a double-blind reader study and includes various CT scans, specifically mentioning 99 non-contrast head CT scans, 100 low-dose non-contrast chest scans, and 100 contrast-enhanced CT scans of the abdomen. The authors provide details about the imaging parameters and the purpose of the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are publicly available and the authors have provided a link for the NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic dataset, I will include that link in the citation. The LDCT-PD dataset is also referenced, but it may not have a formal citation since it is a dataset used in clinical practice.

The citations I will compile are:

- For the **NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Grand Challenge Dataset**, the citation is:
  > NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Grand Challenge. Available: https://www.aapm.org/GrandChallenge/LowDoseCT/#.

- For the **LDCT-PD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > LDCT-PD Dataset. Available: https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=52758026.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
