To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comprehensive Analysis of Network Robustness Evaluation Based on Convolutional Neural Networks with Spatial Pyramid Pooling" by Wenjun Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may hint at the datasets used. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, potentially naming specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors describe their methodology and the types of networks they used for training and testing. They mention using **synthetic networks** generated from the Erdős-Rényi (ER) model and Barabási-Albert (BA) model, which are common in network robustness studies.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail the types of networks used, including:
1. **Synthetic Networks**: 
   - **Erdős-Rényi (ER) Networks**: These networks are characterized by a random graph model where each edge is included with a probability p.
   - **Barabási-Albert (BA) Networks**: These networks follow a scale-free model where new nodes prefer to attach to existing nodes with higher degrees.

The authors also mention **empirical networks** from various fields, specifically:
- **USAirRouter Network**
- **HI-II-14 Network** (a protein interaction network)
- **Biological Network**

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the empirical networks are as follows:

- For the **USAirRouter Network**:
  > R. A. Rossi, N. K. Ahmed. *The network data repository with interactive graph analytics and visualization*. In: AAAI, 2015. doi:10.1609/aaai.v29i1.9277.

- For the **HI-II-14 Network**:
  > R. A. Rossi, N. K. Ahmed. *The network data repository with interactive graph analytics and visualization*. In: AAAI, 2015. doi:10.1609/aaai.v29i1.9277.

- For the **Biological Network**:
  > R. A. Rossi, N. K. Ahmed. *The network data repository with interactive graph analytics and visualization*. In: AAAI, 2015. doi:10.1609/aaai.v29i1.9277.

The synthetic networks (ER and BA) do not have specific citations as they are generated models commonly used in network analysis.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the empirical networks and a brief description of the synthetic networks used in the study. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
