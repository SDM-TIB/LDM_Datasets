To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scalable lipid droplet microarray fabrication, validation, and screening" by Tracey N. Bella et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the screening of **90 natural product extracts**, which indicates that there is a dataset related to these extracts.

Next, I will examine the **Methods section**, particularly focusing on the parts that describe the experimental setup and any datasets used. In the Methods, the authors mention using extracts from the **US NCI Natural Products Repository library** for their screening, which is a significant dataset.

I will also look into the **Results and Discussion section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or any specific details about the datasets used in the experiments. The authors discuss the screening of **92 different natural product extracts**, which confirms the dataset's relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

1. For the **US NCI Natural Products Repository library**, the citation is:
   > Thornburg, C.C., et al. "NCI Program for Natural Product Discovery: A Publicly-Accessible Library of Natural Product Fractions for High-Throughput Screening." *ACS Chem Biol*, 2018, 13(9): 2484-2497.

2. For the **doxycycline** used in the assays, the citation is:
   > National Center for Biotechnology Information. "PubChem Compound Summary for CID 54671203, Doxycycline." https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Doxycycline. Accessed Aug. 30, 2021.

3. For the **Erlotinib** used as a positive control, the citation is:
   > Pérez-Soler, R., et al. "Determinants of tumor response and survival with erlotinib in patients with non—small-cell lung cancer." *Journal of Clinical Oncology*, 2004, 22(16): 3238-3247.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or datasets from the paper.
