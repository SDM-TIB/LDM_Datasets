To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MM-SHAP: A Performance-agnostic Metric for Measuring Multimodal Contributions in Vision and Language Models & Tasks" by Letitia Parcalabescu and Anette Frank, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their proposed metric, MM-SHAP, on various vision and language models across different tasks and datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors describe the tasks and datasets used for evaluation. In **Section 4.1 (Tasks)**, they mention using the following datasets:

1. **VQA v2.0**: This dataset is used for the Visual Question Answering task. It is a well-known dataset that contains images paired with questions and answers.
   
2. **GQA**: Another dataset used for visual reasoning and compositional question answering, which is mentioned in the context of the experiments.

3. **MSCOCO**: This dataset is referenced for image-sentence alignment tasks, specifically for evaluating the models' performance on the validation set.

4. **VALSE**: A benchmark dataset that focuses on linguistic phenomena, which is used to assess the models' multimodal contributions.

In **Section 4.2 (Models)**, the authors describe the models they evaluated, but they do not provide additional datasets in this section. However, they do mention that the models were pretrained on datasets like MSCOCO, which is relevant for understanding the context of the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MSCOCO**, the citation is:

- For **VALSE**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and attributed. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets mentioned in the paper.
