To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Fast and Robust Target Models for Video Object Segmentation" by Andreas Robinson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors perform extensive experiments on the **YouTube-VOS** and **DAVIS** datasets, indicating that these are the primary datasets used in their research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) to gather more detailed information about these datasets. In this section, the authors explicitly mention that they conduct experiments on the **YouTube-VOS** and **DAVIS** datasets. I will look for specific details about each dataset, such as the number of sequences, types of annotations, and any relevant characteristics that might be useful for understanding their application in the study.

In the **References section**, I will locate the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For the **YouTube-VOS dataset**, the citation is:
> Ning Xu, Linjie Yang, Yuchen Fan, Dingcheng Yue, Yuchen Liang, Jianchao Yang, and Thomas Huang. *YouTube-VOS: A Large-Scale Video Object Segmentation Benchmark*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, 2018.

For the **DAVIS dataset**, the citation is:
> F. Perazzi, J. Pont-Tuset, B. McWilliams, L. Van Gool, M. Gross, and A. Sorkine-Hornung. *A Benchmark Dataset and Evaluation Methodology for Video Object Segmentation*. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **YouTube-VOS**: A large-scale video object segmentation benchmark with 474 sequences across 91 classes, designed for evaluating video object segmentation methods.
2. **DAVIS**: A benchmark dataset for video object segmentation that includes various sequences with pixel-level annotations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
