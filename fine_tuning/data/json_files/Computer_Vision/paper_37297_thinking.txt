To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting Local Structures with the Kronecker Layer in Convolutional Networks" by Shuchang Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on **SVHN**, **CASIA-HWDB**, and **ImageNet** datasets, which suggests that these are key datasets used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about these datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of using convolutional neural networks and mentions the need for efficient models, but it does not provide further details about the datasets.

I will then look into the **experiments** section, specifically **section 5**, where the authors describe their empirical studies. Here, they provide detailed information about the datasets used:

1. **SVHN (Street View House Numbers)**: This dataset is described as a real-world digit recognition dataset consisting of photos of house numbers in Google Street View images. The authors mention that it contains 73,257 digits for training and 26,032 digits for testing, along with additional samples for validation.

2. **CASIA-HWDB**: This dataset is noted as an offline Chinese handwriting dataset containing over 3 million character samples from more than 7,000 character classes. The authors reference a previous work that achieved a state-of-the-art error rate on this dataset.

3. **ImageNet**: The paper mentions that ImageNet is a large-scale visual recognition dataset with 1.2 million images across 1,000 categories. The authors use the AlexNet architecture as a baseline for their experiments on this dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. In NIPS workshop on deep learning and unsupervised feature learning, volume 2011, page 5. Granada, Spain, 2011.

- For **CASIA-HWDB**, the citation is:
  > Cheng-Lin Liu, Fei Yin, Da-Han Wang, and Qiu-Feng Wang. *Casia online and offline Chinese handwriting databases*. In Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), 2011 International Conference on, pages 37–41. IEEE, 2011.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, Alexander C. Berg, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), pages 1–42, April 2015. doi: 10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
