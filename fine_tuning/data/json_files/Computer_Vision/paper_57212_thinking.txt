To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Mitigating Negative Transfer in Multi-Task Learning with Exponential Moving Average Loss Weighting Strategies" by Anish Lakkapragada et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors benchmark their methods on three established datasets, which suggests that I should find specific names and details of these datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that their techniques are competitive and superior to several other best-performing techniques on the **CelebA, AffWild2, and AffectNet datasets**. This gives me the names of the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section**, where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. They confirm that they tested their models on the **CelebA**, **AffWild2**, and **AffectNet** datasets, providing additional context about each dataset's characteristics and the tasks associated with them.

Now, I will check the **appendix and references section** to gather full citations for each dataset. The references provide authoritative sources for each dataset:

1. **CelebA Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Liu, Z.; Luo, P.; Wang, X.; and Tang, X. (2015). *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

2. **AffWild2 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Kollias, D. (2022). *Abaw: Learning from synthetic data & multi-task learning challenges*. arXiv:2207.01138.

3. **AffectNet Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Mollahosseini, A.; Hasani, B.; and Mahoor, M. H. (2017). *Affectnet: A database for facial expression, valence, and arousal computing in the wild*. IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, 10(1): 18â€“31.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow me to present a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, complete with full citations for each one.
