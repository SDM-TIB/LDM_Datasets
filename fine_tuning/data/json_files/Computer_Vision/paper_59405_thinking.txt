To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SIM: Semantic-aware Instance Mask Generation for Box-Supervised Instance Segmentation" by Ruihuang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of weakly supervised instance segmentation and hints at the datasets used for evaluation. This suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments on the **COCO** and **PASCAL VOC** datasets. I will note these datasets as they are likely to be the primary datasets used for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about their methodology and the datasets used. They specifically mention that their model is trained on the **COCO dataset**, which contains about 115k images from 80 categories with only box annotations, and they use the **PASCAL VOC dataset** for additional validation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **COCO dataset**:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755. Springer, 2014.

- For the **PASCAL VOC dataset**:
  > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2):303–338, 2010.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **COCO Dataset**: A large-scale dataset containing about 115k images from 80 categories, primarily used for object detection and segmentation tasks.
2. **PASCAL VOC Dataset**: A well-known dataset for object detection and segmentation, containing images from 20 object categories.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
