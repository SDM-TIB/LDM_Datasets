To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model Imitation for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning" by Yueh-Hua Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, or specific tasks associated with the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

In this paper, I will specifically look for datasets related to reinforcement learning, as the title suggests a focus on model-based reinforcement learning. I will also pay attention to any mentions of benchmark datasets or commonly used datasets in the field.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will organize the extracted information in a structured manner, ready for further processing or review.
