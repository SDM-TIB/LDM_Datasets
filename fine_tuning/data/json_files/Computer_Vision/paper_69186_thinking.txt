To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unconditional Latent Diffusion Models Memorize Patient Imaging Data" by Salman Ul Hassan Dar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained latent diffusion models on CT, MR, and X-ray datasets for synthetic data generation, which suggests that these datasets are crucial to the study.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, specifically **section 2.3 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three specific datasets:

1. **Chest X-ray Dataset**: A publicly available 2D chest X-ray dataset, analyzed with a subset of 20,000 images, where 10,000 were reserved for training and 10,000 for validation.

2. **Knee MRI Dataset (MRNet)**: A publicly available 3D knee MRI dataset, consisting of MR volumes from 904 subjects for training and 226 for validation.

3. **Photon Counting Computer Tomography Angiography (PCCTA)**: This dataset includes 3D-PCCTA data from 65 coronary artery disease patients, with 242 volumes for training and 58 for validation.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Chest X-ray Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, X., Peng, Y., Lu, L., Lu, Z., Bagheri, M., & Summers, R. M. (2017). ChestX-ray8: Hospital-scale chest X-ray database and benchmarks on weakly-supervised classification and localization of common thorax diseases. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For the **Knee MRI Dataset (MRNet)**, the citation is:
  > Bien, N., Rajpurkar, P., Ball, R. L., Irvin, J., Park, A., Jones, E., ... & Lungren, M. P. (2018). Deep-learning-assisted diagnosis for knee magnetic resonance imaging: Development and retrospective validation of MRNet. PLOS Medicine, 15(11), e1002711.

- For the **PCCTA Dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the text, so I will note that it was acquired at the Mannheim University Hospital, but I will need to verify if there is a specific publication associated with this dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that full citations are included for reference. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the study.
