To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OSM-Net: One-to-Many One-shot Talking Head Generation with Spontaneous Head Motions" by Jin Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the method achieves state-of-the-art performance on **LRW, VoxCeleb2, and HDTF datasets**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors describe the datasets used for quantitative and qualitative evaluations. They mention:

1. **LRW Dataset**: Contains over 1000 utterances of 500 different words.
2. **VoxCeleb2 Dataset**: Comprises a total of 6112 celebrities covering over a million utterances, with large pose movements and varying light conditions.
3. **HDTF Dataset**: Contains high-resolution and in-the-wild talking head videos.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. 

- For the **LRW Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chung, J. S., & Zisserman, A. (2016). Lip reading in the wild. In *Asian Conference on Computer Vision*. Springer, 2016, pp. 87–103.

- For the **VoxCeleb2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chung, J. S., Nagrani, A., & Zisserman, A. (2018). Voxceleb2: Deep speaker recognition. arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.05622.

- For the **HDTF Dataset**, the citation is:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
