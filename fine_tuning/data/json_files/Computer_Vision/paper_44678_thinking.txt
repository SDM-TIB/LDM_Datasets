To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Solving Inverse Stochastic Problems from Discrete Particle Observations Using the Fokker-Planck Equation and Physics-informed Neural Networks" by Xiaoli Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a framework for solving inverse problems using sparse data, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors may refer to existing datasets used for validation or comparison, which will help in identifying the datasets relevant to their research.

In the **methodology section**, I will pay close attention to any subsections that discuss data collection or datasets used in experiments. The authors might describe the types of data they used, including any specific datasets or sources.

I will also check the **results section** for any references to datasets that were analyzed or compared against the proposed methods. This section often contains valuable information about the datasets used in experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I would look for the full citation in the references, which might be something like:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
