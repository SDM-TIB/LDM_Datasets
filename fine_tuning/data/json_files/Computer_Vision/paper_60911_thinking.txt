To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GCFAgg: Global and Cross-view Feature Aggregation for Multi-view Clustering" by Weiqing Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of multi-view clustering and the need for effective datasets. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets here. I will need to look further into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **Table 1**, which lists the datasets used for evaluation. The table provides a summary of 13 public multi-view datasets, including their sample sizes, number of views, and number of clusters. This is a crucial section for identifying the datasets.

The datasets mentioned in Table 1 are:

1. **Prokaryotic**: 551 samples, 3 views, 4 clusters.
2. **Synthetic3d**: 600 samples, 3 views, 3 clusters.
3. **MNIST-USPS**: 5000 samples, 2 views, 10 clusters.
4. **CCV**: 6773 samples, 3 views, 20 clusters.
5. **Hdigit**: 10000 samples, 2 views, 10 clusters.
6. **Cifar10**: 50000 samples, 3 views, 10 clusters.
7. **Cifar100**: 50000 samples, 3 views, 100 clusters.
8. **YouTubeFace**: 101499 samples, 5 views, 31 clusters.
9. **Caltech-5V**: 1400 samples, 5 views, 7 clusters.
10. **NGs**: 500 samples, 3 views, 5 clusters.
11. **Cora**: 2708 samples, 2 views, 7 clusters.
12. **BDGP**: 2500 samples, 2 views, 5 clusters.
13. **Fashion**: 10000 samples, 3 views, 10 clusters.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations may not always be directly provided in the paper, so I will need to look for the original sources of these datasets.

For example, I can find the following citations:

- **Prokaryotic Dataset**: 
  > Maria Brbić, Matija Piškorec, Vedrana Vidulin, Anita Kriško, Tomislav Šmuc, and Fran Supek. *The landscape of microbial phenotypic traits and associated genes*. Nucleic Acids Research, 44(1):gkw964, 2016.

- **MNIST-USPS Dataset**: 
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: 
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- **YouTubeFace Dataset**: 
  > Yu-Gang Jiang, Guangnan Ye, Shih-Fu Chang, Daniel Ellis, and Alexander C Loui. *Consumer video understanding: A benchmark database and an evaluation of human and machine performance*. In Proceedings of the 1st ACM International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval, pages 1–8, 2011.

I will continue this process for each dataset listed in Table 1, ensuring that I gather the correct citations.

Finally, I will compile all the dataset entries, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
