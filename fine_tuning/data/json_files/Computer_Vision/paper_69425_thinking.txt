To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Determining the significance and relative importance of parameters of a simulated quenching algorithm using statistical tools" by P.A. Castillo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not detail specific datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors typically describe the experimental setup and any datasets utilized for testing their proposed methods. In this paper, the authors mention using four well-known function optimization problems: **Griewangk, Rastrigin, Ackley, and Rana**. I will note these as they are likely the datasets of interest.

In the **results section**, the authors analyze the performance of their algorithm on these datasets, which further confirms their relevance. I will ensure to gather any specific details about how these datasets were used in the experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the function optimization problems are as follows:

1. **Griewangk Function**:
   > Griewank, A.O. "Generalized descent for global optimization." *Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications*, 34(1):11–39, 1981.

2. **Rastrigin Function**:
   > Törn, A. and Zilinskas, A. "Global Optimization." *Vol. 350 of Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science*, Springer, Berlin, 1989.

3. **Ackley Function**:
   > Ackley, D.H. "A connectionist machine for genetic hillclimbing." Kluwer, Boston, 1987.

4. **Rana Function**:
   > Whitley, D., Garrett, D., and Watson, J.P. "Quad search and hybrid genetic algorithms." In *Genetic and Evolutionary Computation - GECCO 2003*, pages 1469–1480. Springer, 2003.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their details accurately.
