To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ANOMALYDAE: DUAL AUTOENCODER FOR ANOMALY DETECTION ON ATTRIBUTED NETWORKS" by Haoyi Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they conduct extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets. This indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will look at **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly list three datasets: 

1. **BlogCatalog**: This dataset contains 5,196 nodes, 8,189 edges, and 300 anomalies.
2. **Flickr**: This dataset consists of 7,575 nodes, 12,047 edges, and 450 anomalies.
3. **ACM**: This dataset includes 16,484 nodes, 71,980 edges, and 600 anomalies.

The statistics for each dataset are summarized in Table 2, which confirms the details about the datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors refer to these datasets as commonly used real-world datasets, but they do not provide specific citations in the references. Therefore, I will note that these datasets are widely recognized in the field, but I will not be able to provide specific citations from this paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics. Since the full citations are not available in the references, I will acknowledge that these datasets are commonly used in anomaly detection research but do not have specific citations from this paper.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing.
