To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CSI Clustering with Variational Autoencoding" by Michael Baur et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of a variational autoencoder for clustering channel state information (CSI) data. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets yet. I will need to look further into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset Description and Network Architecture)**, where the authors describe the dataset they created for their experiments. They mention that they created a dataset of wireless channels based on the 3GPP urban-macro channel model, which consists of 33,000 channels per model order, specifically for channels with one to five propagation paths. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including the number of samples and the conditions under which they were generated.

The authors also mention that the dataset is divided into training and evaluation sets, with 30,000 channels for training and 3,000 for evaluation. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the 3GPP channel model, as it is the basis for the dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **3GPP Channel Model**: 
  > 3GPP, “Spatial channel model for Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) simulations (Release 16),” Tech. Rep., 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), 2020.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: 3GPP Urban-Macro Channel Model Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset of wireless channels created for the 3GPP urban-macro channel model, consisting of 33,000 channels per model order (1 to 5 propagation paths). The dataset is split into 30,000 channels for training and 3,000 for evaluation.
   - **Full Citation**: 3GPP, “Spatial channel model for Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) simulations (Release 16),” Tech. Rep., 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), 2020.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant dataset details and citations from the research paper.
