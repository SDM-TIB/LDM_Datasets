To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Graph Translation" by Xiaojie Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they describe two groups of datasets:

1. **Synthetic Datasets**:
   - **Scale-free Graph Datasets**: These datasets consist of input graphs generated as scale-free networks, with specific parameters for edge addition.
   - **Poisson-random Graph Datasets**: These datasets are generated using the Barabasi-Albert model, with additional edges added according to a Poisson distribution.

2. **Real-World Dataset**:
   - **User Authorization Datasets**: This dataset includes authentication activities of users in an enterprise computer network, which has been publicly released by LANL. It consists of positive and negative classes, representing hacked and normal graphs.

In **subsection 4.1.1**, the authors provide further details about the User Authorization Datasets, explaining that they span a year of activity and include logs from approximately 24,000 computers. They also mention that the dataset can reflect whether a user's account has been hacked based on the differences in authentication behavior.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **User Authorization Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alexander D. Kent. *Comprehensive, Multi-Source Cyber-Security Events*. Los Alamos National Laboratory, 2015.

The synthetic datasets do not have specific citations as they are generated datasets based on established models (scale-free and Poisson-random graphs), but I will note the models used for their generation.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Scale-free Graph Datasets**: Generated as scale-free networks with a specific edge addition probability.
2. **Poisson-random Graph Datasets**: Generated using the Barabasi-Albert model with additional edges added according to a Poisson distribution.
3. **User Authorization Datasets**: Authentication activities of users in an enterprise network, publicly released by LANL.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I include the full citation for the User Authorization Dataset and note the models for the synthetic datasets.
