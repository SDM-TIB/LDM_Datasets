To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Race Bias Analysis of Bona Fide Errors in Face Anti-Spoofing" by Latifah Abduh and Ioannis Ivrissimtzis, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors analyze bias in face anti-spoofing using specific databases, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the context of their research. They mention the use of the **Replay Attack** and **Spoof in the Wild (SiW)** databases for training their face anti-spoofing algorithm. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their study.

In the **background section**, the authors provide more details about the datasets. They specify that the **Replay Attack** database consists of 50 subjects from three ethnicities and that the **SiW** database includes 165 subjects from four ethnicities. This information is essential for understanding the datasets' composition and purpose.

I will also check the **experiments section** where the authors describe how they validate their models using these datasets. They mention that the bias analysis is performed on the **SiW** and **Racial Faces in the Wild (RFW)** databases, confirming their significance in the study.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Replay Attack Database**:
   > Ivana Chingovska, André Anjos, and Sébastien Marcel. *On the effectiveness of local binary patterns in face anti-spoofing*. In The International Conference of Biometrics Special Interest Group (BIOSIG), pages 1–7. IEEE, 2012.

2. **SiW Database**:
   > Yaojie Liu, Amin Jourabloo, and Xiaoming Liu. *Learning deep models for face anti-spoofing: Binary or auxiliary supervision*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Salt Lake City, UT, June 2018.

3. **Racial Faces in the Wild (RFW)**:
   > Mei Wang, Weihong Deng, Jiani Hu, Xunqiang Tao, and Yaohai Huang. *Racial faces in the wild: Reducing racial bias by information maximization adaptation network*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 692–702, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for future reference or processing.
