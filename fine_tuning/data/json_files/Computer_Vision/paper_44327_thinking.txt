To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Directional Temporal Modeling for Action Recognition" by Xinyu Li, Bing Shuai, and Joseph Tighe, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on **four popular activity recognition datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention:

1. **UCF-101**: This dataset includes 101 categories of human actions and contains more than 13,000 videos with an average length of 180 frames per video.

2. **HMDB-51**: This dataset consists of 6,766 videos organized into 51 distinct action categories, with three splits for evaluation.

3. **Something-Something V2**: This dataset contains approximately 220,847 videos across 174 action categories, requiring strong temporal modeling.

4. **Kinetics-400**: This dataset consists of around 240,000 training and 20,000 validation videos trimmed to 10 seconds from 400 human action categories.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **UCF-101**, the citation is:
  > Soomro, K., Zamir, A.R., Shah, M. (2012). *A dataset of 101 human action classes from videos in the wild*. Center for Research in Computer Vision.

- For **HMDB-51**, the citation is:

- For **Something-Something V2**, the citation is:
  > Goyal, R., Kahou, S.E., Michalski, V., et al. (2017). *The “Something Something” video database for learning and evaluating visual common sense*. In ICCV.

- For **Kinetics-400**, the citation is:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
