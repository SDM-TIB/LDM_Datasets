To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DIFFDOCK: Diffusion Steps, Twists, and Turns for Molecular Docking" by Gabriele Corso et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that DIFFDOCK achieves a 38% top-1 success rate on **PDBBind**, indicating that this is a dataset used for evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used. In the experiments, the authors mention that they evaluate their method on **PDBBind**, which is a well-known benchmark for molecular docking. They also discuss using structures generated by **ESMFold** for additional evaluations, which suggests that ESMFold is another dataset or source of data they utilized.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. **PDBBind**: The citation for PDBBind is:
   > Liu, Z., Su, M., Han, L., Liu, J., Yang, Q., & Wang, R. (2017). Forging the basis for developing proteinâ€“ligand interaction scoring functions. *Accounts of Chemical Research*, 50(2), 302-309.

2. **ESMFold**: The citation for ESMFold is:
   > Lin, Z., Akin, H., Rao, R., Hie, B., Zhu, Z., Lu, W., Santos Costa, A. d., Fazel-Zarandi, M., Sercu, T., & Candido, S. (2022). Language models of protein sequences at the scale of evolution enable accurate structure prediction. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2206.01729*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets mentioned in the paper.
