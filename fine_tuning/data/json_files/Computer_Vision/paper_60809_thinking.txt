To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring One-Shot Semi-Supervised Federated Learning with Pre-trained Diffusion Models" by Mingzhao Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on three large-scale datasets, which indicates that specific datasets are used. I will look for the names of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) in detail, particularly focusing on the **experimental setup** subsection. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. They mention:

1. **DomainNet**: A large-scale dataset consisting of six domains (clipart, infograph, painting, quickdraw, real, and sketch) with 345 categories.
2. **OpenImage**: A dataset with a hierarchy of categories, from which 20 super-categories with 6 subcategories each were selected.
3. **NICO++**: This dataset is divided into common contexts (NICO++ C) and unique contexts (NICO++ U), both containing the same 60 classes.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **DomainNet**:

- For **OpenImage**:
  > Kuznetsova, A., Rom, H., Alldrin, N., Uijlings, J., Krasin, I., Pont-Tuset, J., Kamali, S., Popov, S., Malloci, M., Kolesnikov, A., et al. (2020).

- For **NICO++**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
