To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improved Noise Schedule for Diffusion Training" by Tiankai Hang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a noise schedule and mentions empirical results on the **ImageNet benchmark**, which suggests that this dataset is relevant to the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they conduct experiments on **ImageNet** with specific resolutions (256x256 and 512x512). This indicates that ImageNet is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The citation for ImageNet is as follows:
> Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 248â€“255. IEEE, 2009.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the ImageNet dataset, I will document this dataset along with its citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation is included for clarity and proper attribution. This will ensure that the dataset extraction is complete and accurate.
