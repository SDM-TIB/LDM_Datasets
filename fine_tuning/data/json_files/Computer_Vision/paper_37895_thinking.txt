To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discriminative Representation Combinations for Accurate Face Spoofing Detection" by Xiao Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their methods on **three public datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the need for robust presentation attack detection methods and hint at the datasets used for evaluation. However, I need to find the exact names and details of these datasets.

In the **experiments section (Section 5)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used:

1. **NUAA Dataset**: This dataset contains 12,641 still images, which include warped photos of different sizes serving as presentation attacks.

2. **CASIA Dataset**: This dataset consists of 600 videos from 50 subjects, covering three types of attacks (photo, cut photo, video) with varying image qualities.

3. **Replay-Attack Dataset**: This dataset includes 1,300 videos from 50 subjects, featuring two shooting backgrounds and three types of attacks (print, digital photo, video).

4. **Our Dataset**: This is a custom dataset created by the authors, consisting of binocular image pairs collected using calibrated web cameras, with a total of 12,000 image pairs.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

- For **NUAA Dataset**:
  > Z. Zhang, J. Yan, S. Liu, Z. Lei, D. Yi, S. Z. Li. *A face antispoofing database with diverse attacks*. In Proceedings of the 2012 5th IAPR International Conference on Biometrics (ICB), pages 26–31, 2012.

- For **CASIA Dataset**:
  > I. Chingovska, A. Anjos, S. Marcel. *On the effectiveness of local binary patterns in face anti-spoofing*. In Proceedings of the 2012 5th IAPR International Conference on Biometrics (ICB), pages 1–7, 2012.

- For **Replay-Attack Dataset**:
  > J. Galbally, S. Marcel, J. Fierrez. *Face anti-spoofing based on general image quality assessment*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Pattern Recognition, pages 1173–1178, 2014.

- For **Our Dataset**: Since this dataset is constructed by the authors and does not have a formal citation, I will note it as a custom dataset created for the study.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
