To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PLACE: Proximity Learning of Articulation and Contact in 3D Environments" by Siwei Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and often highlights key datasets used in the study. In this case, the authors mention evaluating their method on three datasets: **PROX, MP3D, and Replica**.

Next, I will delve into **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they describe:

1. **PROX Dataset**: This dataset includes 12 different room 3D scans and captures natural actions of 20 subjects, represented by SMPL-X body meshes. The authors mention that they extracted interaction features from 63,599 human-scene pairs and performed data augmentation to obtain a total of 254,396 training samples.

2. **MP3D Dataset**: This dataset consists of 90 building-scale scene scans with semantic annotations. The authors specify that they performed testing on 7 scenes and generated 6400 random samples for evaluation.

3. **Replica Dataset**: This dataset contains reconstructed indoor scenes with dense geometry, including 18 scenes of 5 different room types. The authors selected 5 rooms for testing and generated 1200 random samples for evaluation.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **PROX Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Hassan, V. Choutas, D. Tzionas, and M. J. Black. *Resolving 3D human pose ambiguities with 3D scene constraints*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2282â€“2292, Oct. 2019.

- For the **MP3D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Chang, A. Dai, T. Funkhouser, M. Halber, M. Niessner, M. Savva, S. Song, A. Zeng, and Y. Zhang. *Matterport3D: Learning from RGB-D data in indoor environments*. International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV), 2017.

- For the **Replica Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Straub, T. Whelan, L. Ma, Y. Chen, E. Wijmans, S. Green, J. J. Engel, R. Mur-Artal, C. Ren, S. Verma, A. Clarkson, M. Yan, B. Budge, Y. Yan, X. Pan, J. Yon, Y. Zou, K. Leon, N. Carter, J. Briales, T. Gillingham, E. Mueggler, L. Pesqueira, M. Savva, D. Batra, H. M. Strasdat, R. D. Nardi, M. Goesele, S. Lovegrove, and R. Newcombe. *The Replica dataset: A digital replica of indoor spaces*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.05797, 2019.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details regarding the datasets used in the research.
