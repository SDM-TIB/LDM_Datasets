To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bayesian parameter estimation using conditional variational autoencoders for gravitational-wave astronomy" by Hunter Gabbard et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) trained on binary black hole (BBH) signals, which suggests that there may be datasets related to gravitational wave signals.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods section**. Here, the authors describe the training process for the CVAE, indicating that they used **107 whitened waveforms** corresponding to parameters drawn from specific priors for the benchmark analysis. This suggests that the dataset used for training the model is based on simulated gravitational wave signals.

In the **results section**, the authors mention testing their model on **256 multi-detector GW test BBH waveforms** in simulated advanced detector noise. This indicates that there is a specific dataset used for testing the performance of their model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets used, but I can infer the following:

1. **Whitened waveforms for training**: The authors mention that these waveforms are generated based on the same priors as assumed for the benchmark analysis. However, they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset. It is likely derived from existing gravitational wave signal models.

2. **Multi-detector GW test BBH waveforms**: The authors refer to a dataset of 256 test waveforms. Again, they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, but it is likely based on simulations or existing datasets used in gravitational wave research.

Since the paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets, I will note that the datasets are based on simulated gravitational wave signals and refer to the general practices in the field for generating such datasets.

Finally, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets:

- **Training Dataset**: 107 whitened waveforms based on parameters drawn from specific priors (no explicit citation provided).
- **Testing Dataset**: 256 multi-detector GW test BBH waveforms in simulated advanced detector noise (no explicit citation provided).

I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
