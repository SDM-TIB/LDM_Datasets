To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tackling Feature-Classifier Mismatch in Federated Learning via Prompt-Driven Feature Transformation" by Xinghao Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the experiments were conducted on multiple datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
3. **Tiny ImageNet**: A smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 100,000 images across 200 classes.

In this section, the authors provide enough detail about each dataset, confirming their use in the experiments.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **Tiny ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Y. Le, X. Yang. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. CS 231N, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
