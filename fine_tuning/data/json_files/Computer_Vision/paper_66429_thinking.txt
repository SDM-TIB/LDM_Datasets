To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Survey of Emerging Applications of Diffusion Probabilistic Models in MRI" by Yuheng Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections detailing the applications of diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs)** in MRI. The abstract provides a general overview, while the introduction sets the context for the research and may mention specific datasets used in the studies reviewed.

Next, I will focus on the **sections that discuss specific applications of DPMs in MRI**, such as reconstruction, image generation, image translation, segmentation, and anomaly detection. Each of these sections may reference different datasets used in the studies being reviewed.

I will pay particular attention to any **tables or figures** that summarize the datasets, as these often provide concise information about the datasets, including their names, characteristics, and the studies that utilized them.

For example, in the paper, there is a table summarizing various datasets used in DPM applications, which includes:

1. **3D Stanford Dataset**: Used for various MRI tasks, including reconstruction.
   - Citation: > Kevin Epperson et al. "Creation of fully sampled MR data repository for compressed sensing of the knee." In 2013 Meeting Proceedings. Section for Magnetic Resonance Technologists, 2013.

2. **ABIDE Dataset**: Focused on brain imaging for autism research.
   - Citation: > Adriana Di Martino et al. "The autism brain imaging data exchange: towards a large-scale evaluation of the intrinsic brain architecture in autism." Molecular psychiatry, 19(6):659–667, 2014.

3. **ACDC Dataset**: Used for cardiac MRI segmentation tasks.
   - Citation: > Olivier Bernard et al. "Deep learning techniques for automatic MRI cardiac multi-structures segmentation and diagnosis: is the problem solved?" IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 37(11):2514–2525, 2018.

4. **BraTS Dataset**: A well-known dataset for brain tumor segmentation.
   - Citation: > Bjoern H Menze et al. "The multimodal brain tumor image segmentation benchmark (brats)." IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 34(10):1993–2024, 2014.

After identifying the datasets, I will ensure to extract the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or utilized for further research.
