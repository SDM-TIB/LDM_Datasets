To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Autonomous Driving Vehicles Using Adaptive Learning Method for Data Fusion" by Farhad Aghili, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the integration of IMU with two RTK GPS units for data fusion, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these technologies.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **methodology**, **experiments**, or **results**. In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any section that discusses the experiments conducted, as this is where datasets are often detailed.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the author mentions conducting tests on the **Canadian Space Agency (CSA) red rover**. This indicates that there may be datasets associated with this specific rover or the experiments conducted with it.

I will then check the **References section** to find any citations related to datasets used in the experiments. The references may provide additional context or full citations for datasets that were utilized in the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will ensure to document the full citations for each dataset. For example, if the paper references the CSA red rover, I will look for the original source or dataset publication that describes this rover and its associated data.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference or use.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Review methodology and experiments sections for detailed dataset descriptions.
3. Check the references for full citations of any datasets mentioned.
4. Document each dataset with its name, description, and full citation.
