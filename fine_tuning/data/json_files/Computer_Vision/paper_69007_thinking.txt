To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SERL: A Software Suite for Sample-Efficient Robotic Reinforcement Learning" by Jianlan Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. In this paper, the authors mention several tasks, including **PCB insertion, cable routing, and object relocation**. I will look for any specific datasets associated with these tasks.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets but describe the tasks they evaluated their framework on. They mention that they used a **Franka Panda arm** and two wrist cameras for their experiments, but they do not provide specific dataset citations.

However, they do reference prior works and methods that may have associated datasets. For example, they mention using **demonstrations** collected from human teleoperation, which could imply that they used datasets from previous studies or their own collected data.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** for any papers that might have datasets related to the tasks described. I will look for any datasets that are commonly used in robotic reinforcement learning, such as those mentioned in the related work or prior studies.

After identifying the relevant datasets, I will compile the full citations for each dataset. If the paper does not provide explicit datasets, I will note that the authors used their own collected data for the experiments.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that I have documented the datasets and their citations clearly, even if they are not explicitly named in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets related to the research conducted in this paper.
