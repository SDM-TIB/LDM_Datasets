To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FIT: Frequency-based Image Translation for Domain Adaptive Object Detection" by Siqi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three challenging domain adaptive object detection tasks, which suggests that specific datasets will be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they describe three datasets:

1. **Cityscapes**: This dataset consists of urban street scenes with 8 categories, containing 2,975 training images and 500 validating images. It is crucial to note the specific details provided about the dataset.

2. **Foggy Cityscapes**: This is a synthetic foggy version of the Cityscapes dataset, which is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method under different weather conditions.

3. **Sim10K**: A virtual dataset that includes 10,000 images generated by the Grand Theft Auto gaming engine, used for adaptation from synthetic to real scenes.

4. **KITTI**: An autonomous driving dataset that contains 7,481 images captured by a standard station wagon with two high-resolution video cameras, used for cross-camera adaptation tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:

- For **Foggy Cityscapes**, the citation is:

- For **Sim10K**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant dataset information from the paper.
