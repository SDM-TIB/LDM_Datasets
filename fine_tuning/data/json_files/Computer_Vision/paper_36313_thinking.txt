To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inversion using a new low-dimensional representation of complex binary geological media based on a deep neural network" by Eric Laloy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a deep neural network for constructing a low-dimensional representation of complex geological media, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the training and evaluation of the model. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **methods** section, particularly focusing on any subsections that discuss the datasets used for training the deep neural network. This section typically provides detailed information about the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and how they were generated or sourced.

In the **results** section, I will look for any references to datasets used in experiments or evaluations. The authors may describe how the datasets were utilized to validate their approach or compare it against other methods.

I will also check the **discussion** and **conclusion** sections for any additional insights or mentions of datasets that may not have been covered in the earlier sections.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the necessary details for each one, including:

1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics (e.g., size, type of data).
3. **Full Citation**: The complete citation for the dataset, which may include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Maules Creek binary aquifer," I would look for the citation in the references section to ensure I have the correct and complete citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will organize it clearly, ensuring that each dataset is well-documented with its name, description, and citation. This structured approach will help in accurately extracting and presenting the datasets from the research paper.
