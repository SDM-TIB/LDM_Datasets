To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Negative-prompt Inversion: Fast Image Inversion for Editing with Text-guided Diffusion Models" by Daiki Miyake et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method and its advantages, but it may not contain detailed information about datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention that they used **100 images and captions, randomly selected from validation data in the COCO dataset** for their experiments. This indicates that the COCO dataset is a key dataset used in their research.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the COCO dataset. The citation for the COCO dataset is as follows:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In David Fleet, Tomas Pajdla, Bernt Schiele, and Tinne Tuytelaars, editors, Computer Vision – ECCV 2014, pages 740–755, Cham, 2014. arXiv:1405.0312v3 [cs.CV].

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the only dataset extracted from this paper is the COCO dataset.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the COCO dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will be ready for any structured output or further processing.
