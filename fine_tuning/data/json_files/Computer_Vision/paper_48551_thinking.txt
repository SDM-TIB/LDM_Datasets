To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3D Convolution Neural Network based Person Identification using Gait cycles" by Ravi Shekhar Tiwari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the model is trained and evaluated on the **CASIA-B Gait dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** and **methodology sections** to gather more details about the dataset. In the introduction, the authors discuss the importance of gait analysis and mention that the CASIA-B Gait dataset consists of 15,000 videos of 124 subjects captured from 11 different angles. This provides a good overview of the dataset's scope.

I will then look at **section III (3D-CNN BASED GAIT ANALYSIS)**, where the authors provide specific details about the dataset. They describe the dataset as consisting of videos of individuals walking with and without objects, and they mention the various angles from which the data was captured. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and its application in their experiments.

In the **results and discussion section**, the authors reiterate that they used the CASIA-B Gait dataset for training and testing their model, which further solidifies its importance in the study.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CASIA-B Gait dataset. The authors refer to the dataset as being acquired from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences. However, they do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself in the references. 

To ensure I have the correct citation, I will look for the original source of the CASIA-B Gait dataset. The dataset is commonly cited as follows:

- **CASIA-B Gait Dataset**:
  > Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences. *CASIA Gait Database*. Available at: http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/english/Gait%20Database.html

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extraction:

1. **Dataset Name**: CASIA-B Gait Dataset
   - **Description**: A large dataset consisting of 15,000 videos of 124 subjects walking captured from 11 different angles, with variations in attire and carrying conditions.
   - **Full Citation**: Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences. *CASIA Gait Database*. Available at: http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/english/Gait%20Database.html

After compiling this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for further processing or review.
