To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Separating the Effects of Batch Normalization on CNN Training Speed and Stability Using Classical Adaptive Filter Theory" by Elaina Chai et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in previous works or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

Upon reviewing Section IV, I find that the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset** for their experiments with LeNet and the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for their experiments with ResNet20. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their significance in the context of the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
> Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 86, no. 11, pp. 2278–2324, 1998.

For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
> Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation for each dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary information is included for future reference or processing.
