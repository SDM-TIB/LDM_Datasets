To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Psychological Dimension of Adaptive Trading in Cryptocurrency Markets" by Misha Perepelitsa, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any explicit mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will check if it references any specific datasets used for analysis or simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **model parameters estimation section** (Section 2) and the **results section** (Section 4). These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for simulations or empirical analysis. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned, including their names, characteristics, and the context in which they were used.

In Section 2, the author discusses the use of daily prices of Bitcoin, Apple stock, and the S&P 500 index over the last 8 years, ending in March 2021. This indicates that these financial time series are datasets relevant to the study. I will note down the details of these datasets, including the time period and the type of data (e.g., daily prices).

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. For instance, if the paper refers to specific datasets or studies that provide the data, I will ensure to extract the complete citation for those sources.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. 

Here are the datasets I have identified:

1. **Bitcoin Price Dataset**: Daily prices of Bitcoin for the last 8 years, ending in March 2021.
   - Citation: Data obtained from Yahoo Finance (https://finance.yahoo.com).

2. **Apple Stock Price Dataset**: Daily prices of Apple stock for the last 8 years, ending in March 2021.
   - Citation: Data obtained from Yahoo Finance (https://finance.yahoo.com).

3. **S&P 500 Index Price Dataset**: Daily prices of the S&P 500 index for the last 8 years, ending in March 2021.
   - Citation: Data obtained from Yahoo Finance (https://finance.yahoo.com).

After compiling this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
