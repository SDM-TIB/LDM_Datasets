To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-supervised Grasp Detection by Representation Learning in a Vector Quantized Latent Space" by Mridul Mahajan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize the **Cornell Grasping Dataset (CGD)**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Results and Analysis)**, where the authors explicitly state that they use the **Cornell Grasping Dataset** for training their networks. They mention that this dataset contains 885 RGB-D images and 5110 positive grasp labels, which confirms its significance in their experiments.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper. However, the focus appears to be primarily on the Cornell Grasping Dataset, as no other datasets are explicitly referenced in the methodology or results sections.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Cornell Grasping Dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- **Cornell Grasping Dataset**:
  > Cornell University. "Robot learning lab: Learning to grasp." Available online: http://pr.cs.cornell.edu/grasping/rect_data/data.php.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, I have identified the following dataset from the paper:

1. **Cornell Grasping Dataset**: A dataset containing 885 RGB-D images and 5110 positive grasp labels, used for training the proposed model.

Now, I will prepare to format this information according to the required output structure, ensuring that the citation is included for the dataset.
