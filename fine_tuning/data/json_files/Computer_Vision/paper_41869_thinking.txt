To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FQ-Conv: Fully Quantized Convolution for Efficient and Accurate Inference" by Bram-Ernst Verhoef et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention demonstrating their approach on "different datasets," which indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Google Speech Commands Dataset**: This dataset consists of 65,000 audio clips of 30 keywords uttered by various speakers. The goal is to classify each audio clip into one of 10 keyword categories or silence/unknown categories. The authors provide details about how the dataset was split and the preprocessing steps taken.

2. **CIFAR-100 Dataset**: This dataset contains 50,000 training and 10,000 testing images across 100 classes. The authors describe the data augmentation techniques used and the architecture of the network applied to this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Google Speech Commands Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Warden, Pete. "Speech commands: A public dataset for single-word speech recognition." Available from http://download.tensorflow.org/data/speech_commands_v0.1, 2017.

- For the **CIFAR-100 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, Alex. "Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images." Technical Report, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will include the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
