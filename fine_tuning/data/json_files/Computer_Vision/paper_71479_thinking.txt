To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SGCNeRF: Few-Shot Neural Rendering via Sparse Geometric Consistency Guidance" by Yuru Xiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention that their experiments demonstrate improvements on the **LLFF** and **DTU** datasets, indicating that these are the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** where the authors provide more details about the datasets. They specifically mention:

1. **LLFF Dataset**: This dataset consists of eight forward-facing scenes, and the authors describe how they sample images for evaluation.
2. **DTU Dataset**: This dataset includes 124 object-centric scenes, and the authors detail how they partition the dataset into training and test scenes.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **LLFF Dataset**, the citation is:
  > B. Mildenhall, P. P. Srinivasan, R. Ortiz-Cayon, N. K. Kalantari, R. Ramamoorthi, R. Ng, and A. Kar. "Local light field fusion: Practical view synthesis with prescriptive sampling guidelines." *ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG)*, vol. 38, no. 4, pp. 1–14, 2019.

- For the **DTU Dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Jensen, A. Dahl, G. Vogiatzis, E. Tola, and H. Aanæs. "Large scale multi-view stereopsis evaluation." In *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition*, pp. 406–413, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
