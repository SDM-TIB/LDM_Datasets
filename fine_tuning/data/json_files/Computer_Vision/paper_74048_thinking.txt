To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating and Mitigating IP Infringement in Visual Generative AI" by Zhenting Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the development of a benchmark for studying IP infringement issues, which suggests that a dataset may be involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (IP Infringement Evaluation)**, where the authors describe their evaluation process. They mention creating a benchmark consisting of six representative IP-protected characters owned by major companies, which indicates that there is a dataset related to these characters.

In **Table 1**, the paper lists the characters involved in the study, which includes:

1. **Spider-Man** (owned by Sony and Marvel)
2. **Iron Man** (owned by Marvel)
3. **Incredible Hulk** (owned by Marvel)
4. **Super Mario** (owned by Nintendo)
5. **Batman** (owned by DC Entertainment)
6. **Superman** (owned by DC Entertainment)

This table confirms that the authors constructed a dataset based on these characters for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or benchmarks mentioned. However, since the paper does not provide specific citations for the dataset itself, I will note that the dataset is based on the characters listed in Table 1, which are widely recognized and can be referenced through their respective franchises.

The citations for the characters are as follows:

- **Spider-Man**: 
  > Spider-Man. (n.d.). In Wikipedia. Retrieved from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man

- **Iron Man**: 
  > Iron Man. (n.d.). In Wikipedia. Retrieved from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man

- **Incredible Hulk**:

- **Super Mario**: 
  > Super Mario. (n.d.). In Wikipedia. Retrieved from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario

- **Batman**: 
  > Batman. (n.d.). In Wikipedia. Retrieved from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman

- **Superman**: 
  > Superman. (n.d.). In Wikipedia. Retrieved from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each character as they represent the basis of the dataset used in the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
