To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HyperDiffusion: Generating Implicit Neural Fields with Weight-Space Diffusion" by Ziya Erkoc et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Results)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets utilized for their experiments. In this section, they describe the datasets for both 3D and 4D shape generation tasks:

1. **ShapeNet Dataset**: The authors state that they used the car, chair, and airplane categories from the ShapeNet dataset, which contains 3533, 6778, and 4045 shapes, respectively.

2. **DeformingThings4D Dataset**: For the 4D shape generation task, they mention using 16-frame animal animation sequences from the DeformingThings4D dataset, comprising 1772 sequences.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **ShapeNet**, the citation is:
  > Angel X Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, Leonidas Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qixing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Hao Su, et al. *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

- For **DeformingThings4D**, the citation is:
  > Yang Li, Hikari Takehara, Takafumi Taketomi, Bo Zheng, and Matthias Nießner. *4DComplete: Non-rigid motion estimation beyond the observable surface*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 12706–12716, 2021.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation. This will ensure that all necessary details are captured for further processing or review.
