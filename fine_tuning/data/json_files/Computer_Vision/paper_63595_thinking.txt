To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RLIPv2: Fast Scaling of Relational Language-Image Pre-training" by Hangjie Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors propose a model that utilizes large-scale pseudo-labelled scene graph data, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific dataset names or references in these sections.

Next, I will review the **methodology** section, particularly where the authors discuss the datasets used for pre-training and evaluation. In this section, they mention using three datasets for pre-training: **Visual Genome (VG)**, **COCO**, and **Objects365**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and how they are utilized in the context of the research.

I will also check the **experiments** section, where the authors evaluate their model on downstream tasks. They mention using **HICO-DET** and **V-COCO** datasets for human-object interaction detection, and **Open Images v6** for scene graph generation. I will gather information on these datasets as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to obtain the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used.

The datasets I will extract and their citations are as follows:

1. **Visual Genome (VG)**:
   > Ranjay Krishna, Yuke Zhu, Oliver Groth, Justin Johnson, Kenji Hata, Joshua Kravitz, Stephanie Chen, Yannis Kalandidis, Li-Jia Li, David A Shamma, et al. *Visual Genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 123(1):32–73, 2017.

2. **COCO (Common Objects in Context)**:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755, 2014.

3. **Objects365**:
   > Shuai Shao, Zeming Li, Tianyuan Zhang, Chao Peng, Gang Yu, Xiangyu Zhang, Jing Li, and Jian Sun. *Objects365: A large-scale, high-quality dataset for object detection*. In ICCV, pages 8430–8439, 2019.

4. **HICO-DET**:
   > Yu-Wei Chao, Zhan Wang, Yugeng He, Jiaxuan Wang, and Jia Deng. *HICO: A benchmark for recognizing human-object interactions in images*. In ICCV, pages 1017–1025, 2015.

5. **V-COCO**:
   > Saurabh Gupta and Jitendra Malik. *Visual semantic role labeling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1505.04474, 2015.

6. **Open Images v6**:
   > Alina Kuznetsova, Hassan Rom, Neil Alldrin, Jasper Uijlings, Ivan Krasin, Jordi Pont-Tuset, Shahab Kamali, Stefan Popov, Matteo Malloci, Alexander Kolesnikov, et al. *The Open Images Dataset V4*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 128(7):1956–1981, 2020.

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
