To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AXIAL: Attention-based eXplainability for Interpretable Alzheimer’s Localized Diagnosis using 2D CNNs on 3D MRI brain scans" by Gabriele Lozupone et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a standardized collection of MRI data from the **Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **methods section**. In section 3, the authors describe the dataset they used: the **ADNI1: Complete 1Yr 1.5T** collection. They mention that this dataset includes 639 subjects and consists of 2,042 acquisitions, which were filtered to yield 1,891 samples after quality control.

In section 3, they also specify the classes extracted from the dataset:
- **CN (Cognitive Normal)**: 3D brain images of patients diagnosed as CN.
- **AD (Alzheimer’s Disease)**: 3D brain images of patients diagnosed with AD.
- **sMCI (Stable Mild Cognitive Impairment)**: 3D brain images of patients diagnosed with MCI who remain MCI over time.
- **pMCI (Progressive Mild Cognitive Impairment)**: 3D brain images of patients initially diagnosed with MCI who later progressed to AD.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ADNI dataset. The relevant citation for the ADNI dataset is:
> Wyman, B.T., Harvey, D.J., Crawford, K., Bernstein, M.A., Carmichael, O., Cole, P.E., Crane, P.K., DeCarli, C., Fox, N.C., Gunter, J.L., et al. (2013). Standardization of analysis sets for reporting results from ADNI MRI data. *Alzheimer’s & Dementia*, 9(3), 332–337.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that all necessary details are captured for future reference or analysis.
