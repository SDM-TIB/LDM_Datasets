To extract datasets from the research paper titled "May the Dance be with You: Dance Generation Framework for Non-Humanoids" by Hyemin Ahn, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a framework for non-humanoid agents to learn to dance from human videos, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the training process.

In the **introduction**, the authors refer to the AIST dance video database as a key resource for training their reward model. This indicates that the AIST dance video database is a primary dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** section. The authors describe how they extract optical flows from the AIST dance video database and use it to train their model. They also mention that they selected 1,200 videos from the basic dance category within this database. This reinforces the importance of the AIST dance video database in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors discuss the agents used for training, specifically mentioning the CartPole and UR5 agents, but they do not introduce any new datasets here. Instead, they focus on how these agents utilize the AIST dance video database for their training.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the AIST dance video database. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **AIST dance video database**:
  > Shuhei Tsuchida, Satoru Fukayama, Masahiro Hamasaki, and Masataka Goto. *AIST dance video database: Multi-genre, multi-dancer, and multi-camera database for dance information processing*. In International Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR), volume 1, page 6, 2019.

Since the AIST dance video database is the only dataset explicitly mentioned and utilized in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's name, description, and citation, ready for any further processing or review.
