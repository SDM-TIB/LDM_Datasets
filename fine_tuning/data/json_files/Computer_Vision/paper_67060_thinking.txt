To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Segment Anything Model-guided Collaborative Learning Network for Scribble-supervised Polyp Segmentation" by Yiming Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the significance of polyp segmentation and mentions the use of various datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention five benchmark colonoscopy datasets:

1. **CVC-ClinicDB**: This dataset is referenced as containing 550 images used for training.
2. **Kvasir**: This dataset consists of 900 images selected for training.
3. **ETIS-LaribPolypDB**: This dataset is used for testing.
4. **CVC-300**: Another dataset utilized for testing.
5. **CVC-ColonDB**: This dataset is also mentioned for testing purposes.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation for proper referencing. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
