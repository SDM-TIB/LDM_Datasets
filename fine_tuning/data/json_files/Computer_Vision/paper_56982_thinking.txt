To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Realization of Causal Representation Learning to Adjust Confounding Bias in Latent Space" by Jia Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's objectives and methods, which may include references to datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, potentially mentioning specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. These sections typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the research. 

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any references to datasets used for experiments, such as the **SWAT (Soil & Water Assessment Tool)** dataset mentioned in the experiments section. The paper describes using synthetic data generated by the SWAT system for hydrology modeling, which is crucial for understanding the context of the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For the **SWAT dataset**, I will note the following citation:
- **SWAT (Soil & Water Assessment Tool)**: 
  > Arnold, J.G., Srinivasan, R., Muttiah, R.S., & Williams, J.R. (1998). *Large area hydrologic modeling and assessment: Part I. Model development*. Journal of the American Water Resources Association, 34(1), 73-89.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets referenced in the paper while maintaining proper academic standards for citation.
