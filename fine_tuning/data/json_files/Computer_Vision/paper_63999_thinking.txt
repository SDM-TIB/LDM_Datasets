To extract datasets from the research paper titled "InterDiff: Generating 3D Human-Object Interactions with Physics-Informed Diffusion" by Sirui Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on multiple human-object interaction datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **BEHAVE Dataset**: This dataset includes recordings of 8 individuals interacting with 20 ordinary objects at a framerate of 30 Hz. The authors refer to the BEHAVE dataset multiple times throughout the paper, confirming its significance in their experiments.

2. **GRAB Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,334 videos of whole-body humans grasping small objects, which were downsampled to 30 FPS. The authors also mention using this dataset to investigate cross-dataset generalizability.

3. **Human-Object Interaction Dataset**: This dataset comprises 6 individuals and 384,000 frames recorded at a framerate of 240 Hz. The authors detail how they processed this dataset for their experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **BEHAVE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bharat Lal Bhatnagar, Xianghui Xie, Ilya Petrov, Cristian Sminchisescu, Christian Theobalt, and Gerard Pons-Moll. *BEHAVE: Dataset and method for tracking human object interactions*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2022.

- For the **GRAB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Omid Taheri, Nima Ghorbani, Michael J Black, and Dimitrios Tzionas. *GRAB: A dataset of whole-body human grasping of objects*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2020.

- For the **Human-Object Interaction Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Weilin Wan, Lei Yang, Lingjie Liu, Zhuoying Zhang, Ruixing Jia, Yi-King Choi, Jia Pan, Christian Theobalt, Taku Komura, and Wenping Wang. *Learn to predict how humans manipulate large-sized objects from interactive motions*. IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 2022.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
