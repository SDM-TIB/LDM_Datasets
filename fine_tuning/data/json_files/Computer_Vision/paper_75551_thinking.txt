To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics of Non-Ideal Reaction-Diffusion Systems: Implications for Active Self-Organization" by Francesco Avanzini et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for simulations or experiments.

Next, I will look for sections that explicitly discuss **experiments or simulations**, as these sections often detail the datasets used. In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any references to numerical simulations or experimental setups that involve specific datasets.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** for any mentions of datasets, as authors often describe the datasets used to validate their findings or to compare with other studies.

If the paper includes a **methods section**, I will examine it closely for any references to datasets, including how they were obtained, their characteristics, and any relevant citations.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset from a previous study, I will ensure to extract the full citation for that study as it appears in the references.

Finally, I will compile the information about each dataset, including its name, description, and full citation, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the details provided.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I thoroughly extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a clear and comprehensive overview of the data used in the research.
