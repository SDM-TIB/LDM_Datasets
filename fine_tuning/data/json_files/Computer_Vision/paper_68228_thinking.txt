To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FlowVid: Taming Imperfect Optical Flows for Consistent Video-to-Video Synthesis" by Feng Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors trained their model with **100k real videos from Shutterstock**. This indicates that there is a dataset used for training, which I need to note down.

Next, I will look for any specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. In this case, I will check the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation and training. The paper mentions using **25 object-centric videos from the public DAVIS dataset** for qualitative evaluation and **50 Shutterstock videos** with 200 designed prompts for quantitative evaluation.

Now, I will gather the necessary details for each dataset:

1. **Shutterstock Dataset**: This dataset consists of 100,000 real videos used for training the FlowVid model. The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, but it is a well-known stock footage source.

2. **DAVIS Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the FlowVid model. The authors mention that they selected 25 object-centric videos from this dataset. I will need to find the full citation for the DAVIS dataset from the references section.

In the **References section**, I will look for the citation for the DAVIS dataset. The citation is as follows:
   > Jordi Pont-Tuset, Federico Perazzi, Sergi Caelles, Pablo Arbel√°ez, Alex Sorkine-Hornung, and Luc Van Gool. *The 2017 DAVIS Challenge on Video Object Segmentation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.00675, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- For the **Shutterstock Dataset**, I will note that it is a collection of 100,000 real videos used for training, but I will not provide a formal citation since it is a commercial dataset.

- For the **DAVIS Dataset**, I will include the full citation as mentioned above.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, ensuring that the citations are complete and accurate for future reference.
