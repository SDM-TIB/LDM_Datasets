To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Checkerboard artifact free sub-pixel convolution" by Andrew Aitken et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that the authors may have used to validate their methods. If no datasets are mentioned here, I will continue to the methods section.

Next, I will examine the **methods section** for any detailed descriptions of the experiments conducted. This section typically outlines the experimental setup and may include specific datasets used for training or testing. I will pay close attention to any dataset names or descriptions provided.

Following that, I will check the **experiments section**. This section is crucial as it often contains explicit mentions of datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study. If the authors conducted experiments on specific datasets, they would likely be detailed here.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using the **ImageNet dataset**, I would look for its citation in the references. The citation for ImageNet is:
> O. Russakovsky et al., "ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge," *International Journal of Computer Vision*, vol. 115, no. 3, pp. 211-252, 2015.

If they mention any other datasets, such as the **BSD500 dataset**, I would find its citation as well:
> D. Martin et al., "A Database of Human Segmented Natural Images and Its Application to Evaluating Segmentation Algorithms and Measuring Ecological Statistics," *Proceedings of the Eighth IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision*, pp. 416-423, 2001.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

This systematic approach ensures that I thoroughly extract and document all relevant datasets from the research paper while providing proper citations for each.
