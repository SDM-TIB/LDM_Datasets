To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling Collaborator: Enabling Subjective Vision Classification With Minimal Human Effort via LLM Tool-Use" by Imad Eddine Toubal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the framework is evaluated across **two public image classification datasets**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that they evaluate their methods on the **Hateful Memes dataset** and the **Agile Modeling dataset**. I will gather details about these datasets, including their purpose and characteristics.

1. **Hateful Memes Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the framework's performance in detecting harmful, racist, or sexist memes. It is a public dataset that challenges models to understand multimodal content.

2. **Agile Modeling Dataset**: This dataset consists of 14 concepts, each with positive and negative images mined from the LAION dataset. It is specifically designed for evaluating the performance of the proposed framework in subjective image classification tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Hateful Memes dataset**, the citation is:
  > Douwe Kiela, Hamed Firooz, Aravind Mohan, Vedanuj Goswami, Amanpreet Singh, Pratik Ringshia, and Davide Testuggine. *The hateful memes challenge: Detecting hate speech in multimodal memes*. NeurIPS, 33:2611â€“2624, 2020.

- For the **Agile Modeling dataset**, the citation is:
  > Otilia Stretcu, Edward Vendrow, Kenji Hata, Krishnamurthy Viswanathan, Vittorio Ferrari, Sasan Tavakkol, Wenlei Zhou, Aditya Avinash, Enming Luo, Neil Gordon Alldrin, et al. *Agile modeling: Image classification with domain experts in the loop*. ICCV, 2023.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
