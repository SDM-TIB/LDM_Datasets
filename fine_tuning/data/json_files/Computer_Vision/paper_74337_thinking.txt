To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding Hallucinations in Diffusion Models through Mode Interpolation" by Sumukh K Aithal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 1.1 (Hallucination in Diffusion Models)**, where the authors describe a synthetic dataset called **SIMPLE SHAPES**. This dataset consists of black and white images containing three shapes: triangle, square, and pentagon. Each image is 64x64 pixels, and the authors detail how the dataset is structured and the generation process.

Then, I will examine **section 4.5 (Mode Interpolation in Real World datasets: HANDS)**, where the authors discuss a dataset of high-quality images of human hands, referred to as the **Hands dataset**. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of images and the subjects involved.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **SIMPLE SHAPES**: Since this is a synthetic dataset created for the study, it may not have a formal citation. However, I will note its description and the context in which it was used.

2. **Hands dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > M. Afifi. 11k hands: gender recognition and biometric identification using a large dataset of hand images. *Multimedia Tools and Applications*, 2019.

Finally, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their descriptions and citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the documentation. This structured approach will help in effectively extracting and presenting the datasets from the research paper.
