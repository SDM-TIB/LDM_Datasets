To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SF-V: Single Forward Video Generation Model" by Zhixing Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments, which suggests that datasets are likely involved. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets or references to data sources.

Next, I will check the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using an "internal video dataset with around one million videos." This indicates that there is a significant dataset involved, but I need to find more specific details about it.

I will also look for any **tables or figures** that might summarize the datasets or provide additional context. If the authors provide any specific names or characteristics of the datasets, I will note those down.

After gathering information about the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to publicly available datasets, I will ensure to include their citations as well.

In this case, the paper does not provide specific names or citations for the internal dataset used, which is common for proprietary datasets. However, I will still document the dataset as follows:

1. **Internal Video Dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately one million videos used for training the model. Since it is an internal dataset, there is no public citation available.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for any publicly available datasets mentioned in the paper. If no external datasets are cited, I will note that the internal dataset does not have a citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a clear record of their details and citations.
