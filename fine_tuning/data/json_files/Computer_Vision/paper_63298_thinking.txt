To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion probabilistic models enhance variational autoencoder for crystal structure generative modeling" by Teerachote Pakornchote et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their model using three datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, particularly where the authors discuss the performance of their model. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets: **Perov-5**, **Carbon-24**, and **MP-20**. I will take note of the descriptions provided for each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they are used.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets easily. 

1. **Perov-5 Dataset**: The authors describe it as consisting of perovskite materials with cubic structures, varying in elemental combinations. The citation for this dataset is:
   > I. E. Castelli, D. D. Landis, K. S. Thygesen, S. Dahl, I. Chorkendorff, T. F. Jaramillo, and K. W. Jacobsen. *New cubic perovskites for one-and two-photon water splitting using the computational materials repository*. Energy & Environmental Science, 5, 9034, 2012.

2. **Carbon-24 Dataset**: This dataset comprises carbon materials with various crystal systems obtained from an ab initio random structure searching algorithm at a pressure of 10 GPa. The citation is:
   > C. J. Pickard. *Ab initio random structure searching*. Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter, 23, 053201, 2011.

3. **MP-20 Dataset**: This dataset encompasses a wide range of compounds and structure types. The citation for this dataset is:
   > A. Jain, S. P. Ong, G. Hautier, W. Chen, W. D. Richards, S. Dacek, S. Cholia, D. Gunter, D. Skinner, G. Ceder, et al. *Commentary: The materials project: A materials genome approach to accelerating materials innovation*. APL Materials, 1, 011002, 2013.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
