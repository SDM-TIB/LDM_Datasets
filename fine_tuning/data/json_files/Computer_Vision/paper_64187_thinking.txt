To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MCM: Multi-condition Motion Synthesis Framework for Multi-scenario" by Zeyu Ling et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the multi-condition human motion synthesis task, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. In the experiments, the authors mention using the **HumanML3D dataset** and the **AIST++ dataset** for their evaluations.

1. **HumanML3D Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of training the main branch model MWNet. It consists of approximately 28,000 motion sequences, each with 3 or 4 captions. The authors mention that they follow the official steps for processing this dataset.

2. **AIST++ Dataset**: This dataset is used for the music-to-dance generation task. It contains 1,408 distinct dance motion sequences, with durations ranging from 7.4 to 48.0 seconds, and includes various dance genres. The authors generated pseudo-captions based on the dance motion descriptions provided by this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **HumanML3D dataset**, the citation is:
  > Guo, C.; Zou, S.; Zuo, X.; Wang, S.; Ji, W.; Li, X.; and Cheng, L. 2022. Generating diverse and natural 3D motions from text. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 5152–5161.

- For the **AIST++ dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li, R.; Yang, S.; Ross, D. A.; and Kanazawa, A. 2021. AI choreographer: Music conditioned 3D dance generation with AIST++. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, 13401–13412.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
