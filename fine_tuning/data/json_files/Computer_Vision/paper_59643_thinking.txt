To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ReorientDiff: Diffusion Model based Reorientation for Object Manipulation" by Utkarsh A. Mishra and Yongxin Chen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method using a set of **YCB-objects**, which indicates that this dataset is relevant to the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology and results sections**. In the results section, the authors discuss the dataset generation and training, indicating that they sampled approximately **40,000 candidate poses** from the YCB dataset. This confirms that the YCB dataset is utilized in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the YCB dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **YCB Object and Model Set**: 
  > B. Calli, A. Singh, A. Walsman, S. Srinivasa, P. Abbeel, and A. M. Dollar. *The YCB Object and Model Set: Towards Common Benchmarks for Manipulation Research*. In 2015 International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR), pages 510â€“517, IEEE, 2015.

Since the paper primarily discusses the YCB dataset, I will focus on this dataset for extraction.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the necessary details, including the full citation, ensuring that it is ready for downstream processing.
