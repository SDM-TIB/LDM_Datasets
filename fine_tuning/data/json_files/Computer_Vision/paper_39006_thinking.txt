To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explaining A Black-box By Using A Deep Variational Information Bottleneck Approach" by Seojin Bang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on three datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In section 4.1, they mention using the **IMDB dataset** for sentiment analysis, which is a well-known dataset containing movie reviews labeled by sentiment. The authors provide details about the dataset, including the number of reviews in the training, validation, and test sets.

In section 4.2, they discuss the **MNIST dataset**, which consists of images of handwritten digits. The authors describe how they grouped the images into training, validation, and test sets, and mention the accuracy achieved by their model on this dataset.

In section 4.3, the authors refer to two datasets: **VDJdb** and **IEDB**, which are used for predicting T-cell receptor (TCR) binding to epitopes. They provide details about the number of samples and the unique sequences in each dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **IMDB Dataset**:

3. **VDJdb**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
