To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VOXBLINK: A LARGE SCALE SPEAKER VERIFICATION DATASET ON CAMERA" by Yuke Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of a dataset called **VoxBlink**, which contains 1.45 million utterances from 38,000 speakers. This indicates that there is a primary dataset to focus on.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly the **Data Mining** section. In this section, the authors provide a comprehensive description of the **VoxBlink** dataset, including its size, source, and characteristics. They also mention a purified version of this dataset called **VoxBlink-clean**, which contains 1.02 million utterances from 18,381 speakers. This indicates that both datasets are significant for the research.

I will also check the **experiments** section to confirm that these datasets were used in the experiments and to gather any additional context about their application. The authors mention using both **VoxBlink** and **VoxBlink-clean** in their evaluations, which reinforces their importance.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper references the **VoxCeleb** dataset, which is mentioned as a comparison point. The citation for **VoxCeleb** is as follows:

- For **VoxCeleb**:
  > A. Nagrani, J. S. Chung, and A. Zisserman. *Voxceleb: a large-scale speaker identification dataset*. In INTERSPEECH, 2017.

Since **VoxBlink** and **VoxBlink-clean** are original datasets introduced in this paper, they do not have separate citations in the references. Instead, I will note that they are created by the authors of this paper.

In summary, I will compile the following datasets:

1. **VoxBlink**: A large-scale audio-visual speaker verification dataset containing 1.45 million utterances from 38,065 speakers.
   - Citation: Yuke Lin, Xiaoyi Qin, Guoqing Zhao, Ming Cheng, Ning Jiang, Haiying Wu, Ming Li. *VOXBLINK: A LARGE SCALE SPEAKER VERIFICATION DATASET ON CAMERA*. 

2. **VoxBlink-clean**: A purified version of the VoxBlink dataset, comprising 1.02 million utterances from 18,381 speakers.
   - Citation: Yuke Lin, Xiaoyi Qin, Guoqing Zhao, Ming Cheng, Ning Jiang, Haiying Wu, Ming Li. *VOXBLINK: A LARGE SCALE SPEAKER VERIFICATION DATASET ON CAMERA*.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing.
