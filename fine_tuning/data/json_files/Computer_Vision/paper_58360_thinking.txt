To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Stochastic Biofilm Disruption Model based on Quorum Sensing Mimickers" by Fatih Gulec and Andrew W. Eckford, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets or experimental results. The abstract mentions the validation of the proposed model with "in vitro experimental results of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm and its disruption by rosmarinic acid as the QS mimicker." This indicates that there are experimental datasets involved, specifically related to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and rosmarinic acid.

Next, I will look for specific **sections** that might detail the datasets used. The **numerical results** section provides insights into the validation of the model with experimental data. It references experimental results obtained from a specific study, which suggests that there are datasets associated with these results.

In the **references section**, I will identify the original sources of the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the following key references that likely contain the datasets used for validation:

1. **Corral-Lugo et al. (2016)**: This paper discusses rosmarinic acid as a QS mimicker and its effects on bacterial behavior. The citation is:
   > A. Corral-Lugo, A. Daddaoua, A. Ortega, M. Espinosa-Urgel, and T. Krell. "Rosmarinic acid is a homoserine lactone mimic produced by plants that activates a bacterial quorum-sensing regulator." *Science Signaling*, vol. 9, no. 409, pp. ra1–ra1, 2016.

2. **Henkel et al. (2013)**: This study provides kinetic modeling data relevant to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The citation is:
   > M. Henkel et al. "Kinetic modeling of the time course of n-butyryl-homoserine lactone concentration during batch cultivations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1." *Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology*, vol. 97, no. 17, pp. 7607–7616, 2013.

3. **Beyenal et al. (2003)**: This reference discusses the growth kinetics of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which may include relevant datasets. The citation is:
   > H. Beyenal, S. N. Chen, and Z. Lewandowski. "The double substrate growth kinetics of Pseudomonas aeruginosa." *Enzyme and Microbial Technology*, vol. 32, no. 1, pp. 92–98, 2003.

After identifying these references, I will summarize the datasets associated with them. The datasets primarily involve experimental results related to the effects of rosmarinic acid on biofilm disruption and the growth kinetics of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets along with their full citations to ensure that all necessary information is documented for future reference or analysis. This structured approach will help in accurately capturing the datasets from the research paper.
