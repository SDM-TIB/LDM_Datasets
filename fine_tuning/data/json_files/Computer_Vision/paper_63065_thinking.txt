To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Artifact Restoration in Histology Images with Diffusion Probabilistic Models" by Zhenqi He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a novel method for artifact restoration in histology images, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the evaluation of this method.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges posed by artifacts in histological images and the need for effective restoration methods. This context indicates that datasets are crucial for demonstrating the effectiveness of their proposed approach.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and testing their models. Here, they mention that the training set is curated from a subset of the **Camelyon17 dataset**, which consists of 2,445 artifact-free images and 2,547 images with artifacts. This is a clear identification of a dataset used in their work.

Additionally, they state that the test set uses another public histology image dataset, which is referenced as containing 462 artifact-free images. They also mention that paired artifact images were obtained through manually synthesized artifacts. This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Camelyon17 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Geert Litjens, Peter Bandi, Babak Ehteshami Bejnordi, Oscar Geessink, Maschenka Balkenhol, Peter Bult, Altuna Halilovic, Meyke Hermsen, Rob van de Loo, Rob Vogels, et al. *1399 h&e-stained sentinel lymph node sections of breast cancer patients: the camelyon dataset*. GigaScience, 7(6):giy065, 2018.

2. The second dataset mentioned is a public histology image dataset, but the authors do not provide a specific name or citation in the text. However, they reference it as being available at a GitHub link. I will note this dataset but will not be able to provide a full citation without additional information.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the Camelyon17 dataset and noting the second dataset's availability without a full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or processing.
