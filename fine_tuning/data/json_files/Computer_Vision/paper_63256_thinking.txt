To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MusicLDM: Enhancing Novelty in Text-to-Music Generation Using Beat-Synchronous Mixup Strategies" by Ke Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors constructed a text-to-music model and trained it on a collection of music data samples. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training and testing. Here, they mention the **Audiostock dataset**, which contains 9,000 music tracks for training and 1,000 tracks for testing, along with a total duration of 455.6 hours. This dataset is crucial for understanding the model's performance.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Audiostock dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for Audiostock, as it seems to be a proprietary dataset. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is referenced but lacks a formal citation.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, particularly in the **methodology** and **experiments** sections. The authors discuss the retraining of the CLAP model on a dataset of 2.8 million text-audio pairs, which is significant. However, they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset either, as it appears to be a combination of various sources.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **Audiostock Dataset**: Contains 9,000 music tracks for training and 1,000 tracks for testing, with a total duration of 455.6 hours. This dataset is used for training the MusicLDM model.

2. **CLAP Training Dataset**: A collection of 2.8 million text-audio pairs, used to retrain the CLAP model, but no specific citation is provided.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to note the lack of formal citations for the proprietary datasets while clearly stating their significance in the context of the research.

In conclusion, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that I have accurately captured all relevant details and citations as required.
