To extract datasets from the research paper titled "S3LAM: Structured Scene SLAM" by Mathieu Gonzalez et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their approach on sequences from several public datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they specifically mention two datasets:

1. **TUM RGB-D Dataset**: This dataset provides a set of RGB frames associated with their ground truth pose. It is commonly used for benchmarking SLAM systems.

2. **KITTI Raw Dataset**: This dataset contains sequences obtained using a camera mounted on a car in various outdoor scenes. The authors evaluate their approach on several sequences from this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **TUM RGB-D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Sturm, N. Engelhard, F. Endres, W. Burgard, and D. Cremers. *A benchmark for the evaluation of RGB-D SLAM systems*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Intelligent Robot Systems (IROS), October 2012.

- For the **KITTI Raw Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Geiger, P. Lenz, and R. Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2012, pages 3354â€“3361.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
