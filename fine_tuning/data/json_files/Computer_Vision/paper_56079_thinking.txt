To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating the Performance of StyleGAN2-ADA on Medical Images" by McKell Woodland et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilized "four public datasets composed of various imaging modalities," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly the **Data subsection**. Here, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets they used. I will carefully note each dataset's name, the type of images it contains, and any relevant details about the dataset's size or characteristics.

The paper mentions the following datasets:

1. **Liver CT Dataset**: This dataset consists of 10,600 512x512 images derived from 97 non-contrast and 108 contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scans. The authors describe the preprocessing steps taken to prepare these images.

2. **SLIVER07 Dataset**: This dataset includes 20 scans from the "Segmentation of the Liver Competition 2007," resulting in a total of 4,159 512x512 images. The authors note that no preprocessing was performed on this dataset.

3. **ChestX-ray14 Dataset**: This dataset comprises 112,120 1024x1024 chest X-ray images in PNG format. The authors mention that no preprocessing was performed on this dataset either.

4. **ACDC Dataset**: The Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge dataset consists of 150 cardiac cine-MRI exams, with the authors using 100 exams from the training dataset, resulting in 1,902 512x512 images after preprocessing.

5. **Medical Segmentation Decathlon (brain tumors) Dataset**: This dataset contains 750 4D MRI volumes, from which the authors extracted 103,030 256x256 PNG images for their experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
