To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EHRDIFF: Exploring Realistic EHR Synthesis with Diffusion Models" by Hongyi Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on publicly available EHR data, which suggests that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. In this section, they state that they used the **MIMIC-III** dataset, which is a well-known publicly available electronic health record database. The authors provide details about the dataset, including the number of EHRs extracted and the preprocessing steps taken.

In section 4.1, the authors describe the MIMIC-III dataset as follows:
- **MIMIC-III**: This dataset contains de-identified clinical EHR data integrated from patients admitted to the intensive care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. The dataset includes diagnosis and procedure ICD-9 codes, with a total of 46,520 EHRs extracted, of which 41,868 were used for model training.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the MIMIC-III dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Johnson, A. E. W.; Pollard, T. J.; Shen, L.; Lehman, L. H.; Feng, M.; Ghassemi, M. M.; Moody, B.; Szolovits, P.; Celi, L. A.; Mark, R. G. MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database. *Scientific Data* 2016, 3.

With this information, I will summarize the dataset details and ensure that the full citation is included.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation, ready for further processing or review.
