To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identity Enhanced Residual Image Denoising" by Saeed Anwar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on three conventional benchmark and three real-world datasets, indicating that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they describe the datasets as follows:

1. **Darmstadt Noise Dataset (DND)**: This dataset is introduced as a benchmark for denoising algorithms, consisting of images with challenging structures. Each image is cropped at 20 locations of size 512 × 512 pixels, yielding 1000 test crops. Importantly, only the test images are provided, with no training or validation images available.

2. **RNI15**: This dataset consists of 15 real noisy images, but it is noted that there are no ground-truth images available for this dataset.

3. **Smartphone Image Denoising Dataset (SIDD)**: This is described as the largest collection of real noisy images, containing a total of 30,000 noisy images gathered from ten different scenes under various lighting conditions using five smartphone cameras, along with their corresponding ground truth images.

Now, I will check the **References section** to obtain the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Darmstadt Noise Dataset (DND)**, the citation is:
  > Tobias Plötz and Stefan Roth. *Benchmarking denoising algorithms with real photographs*. In CVPR, 2017.

- For **RNI15**, the citation is:
  > Marc Lebrun, Miguel Colom, and Jean-Michel Morel. *The noise clinic: a blind image denoising algorithm*. IPOL, 2015.

- For **Smartphone Image Denoising Dataset (SIDD)**, the citation is:
  > Abdelrahman Abdelhamed, Stephen Lin, and Michael S. Brown. *A high-quality denoising dataset for smartphone cameras*. In CVPR, 2018.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the proposed method.
