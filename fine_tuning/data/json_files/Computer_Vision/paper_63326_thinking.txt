To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AvatarVerse: High-quality & Stable 3D Avatar Creation from Text and Pose" by Huichao Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a **DensePose-conditioned ControlNet** trained on **800K images**, which suggests that there is a dataset involved, but I need to confirm its name and details.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of generating 3D avatars and references various methods and datasets used in prior research, but it does not specify any datasets used in this work.

In the **methodology section**, the authors mention training the ControlNet using the **DeepFashion dataset**. This is a key dataset that I need to document. I will look for a detailed description of this dataset, including its purpose and characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors discuss the implementation details and mention the **DensePose dataset** as well, which is used for training the DensePose model. This is another important dataset to include.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **DeepFashion Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Liu, L., Gu, J., Lin, K. Z., Chua, T.-S., & Theobalt, C. (2016). DeepFashion: Powering Robust Clothes Recognition and Retrieval with Rich Annotations. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 1096–1104.

2. **DensePose Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Güler, R. A., Neverova, N., & Kokkinos, I. (2018). DensePose: Dense Human Pose Estimation in the Wild. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 7297–7306.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
