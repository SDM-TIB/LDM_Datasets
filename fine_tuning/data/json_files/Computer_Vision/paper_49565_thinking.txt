To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bagging Supervised Autoencoder Classifier for Credit Scoring" by Mahsan Abdoli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "benchmark and real-life credit scoring datasets," which indicates that there are specific datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Taiwan Credit Data**: This dataset is described as containing 30,000 samples with 24 variables for a binary classification task to predict loan defaults. The authors note that the imbalance ratio is 3.52.

2. **Lending Club Dataset**: This dataset consists of loan data from the Lending Club platform, specifically focusing on loans with a payback duration of 36 months. The final dataset includes 206,732 samples with 82 variables, and the imbalance ratio is reported as 5.98.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Taiwan Credit Data**, the citation is:
  > UCI Machine Learning Repository. (n.d.). *Taiwan Credit Data*. Retrieved from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Taiwan

- For the **Lending Club Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kaggle. (n.d.). *Lending Club Dataset*. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club

With this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
