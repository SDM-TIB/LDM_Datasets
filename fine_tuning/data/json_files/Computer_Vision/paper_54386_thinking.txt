To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can Push-forward Generative Models Fit Multimodal Distributions?" by Antoine Salmona et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions validating findings on "one-dimensional and image datasets," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention training GANs, VAEs, and SGMs on datasets derived from MNIST, specifically focusing on two experiments: one with a mixture of two different digits (3 and 7) and another with a subset of all 3s and 7s from MNIST. This indicates that the MNIST dataset is a primary dataset used in their experiments.

In **subsection 4.1**, the authors detail the first experiment, stating they used "10000 noisy versions of these images drawn with a noise amount of Ïƒ = 0.15," forming a dataset of 20002 independent samples. This dataset is derived from the original MNIST dataset.

In **subsection 4.2**, they describe the second experiment, which involves training on the subset of MNIST containing all 3s and 7s. They emphasize that their goal is not to achieve state-of-the-art performance but to illustrate their theoretical results.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
   > LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., & Haffner, P. (1998). Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition. *Proceedings of the IEEE*, 86(11), 2278-2324.

2. **Additional Datasets**: The paper does not mention any other specific datasets beyond the MNIST dataset and its derived versions.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.
