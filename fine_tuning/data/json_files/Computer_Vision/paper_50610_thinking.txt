To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Effects of Artificial Data Modification" by Antonia Marcu and Adam Prügel-Bennett, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the impact of data distortion and augmentation methods, which may imply the use of specific datasets for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, they mention several datasets in the context of their experiments, specifically:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
3. **Tiny ImageNet**: A smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 100,000 images across 200 classes.
4. **FashionMNIST**: A dataset of 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items, serving as a drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset.
5. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with over 14 million images across thousands of categories, widely used for training deep learning models.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources. 

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **CIFAR-10**: 
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Master’s thesis, University of Toronto, 2009.

- **CIFAR-100**: 
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Master’s thesis, University of Toronto, 2009.

- **Tiny ImageNet**: 
  > Stanford. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. 2015. URL: https://tiny-imagenet.herokuapp.com/.

- **FashionMNIST**: 
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Ludwig Obermayer. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or analysis.
