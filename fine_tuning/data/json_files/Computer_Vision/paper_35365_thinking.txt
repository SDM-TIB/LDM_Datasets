To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning representations of multivariate time series with missing data" by Filippo Maria Bianchi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed model on several classification tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention several datasets, including:

1. **EHR Dataset**: This dataset consists of blood samples collected over time from patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery. It contains 883 multivariate time series (MTS) with 10 blood sample measurements collected over 20 days. The authors specify that the dataset is used to classify patients with and without surgical site infections.

2. **Physionet Dataset**: This dataset includes time series data from ECGs, divided into four classes: normal, atrial fibrillation, other symptoms, and noisy records. The authors do not provide specific details about the number of samples or features in this section, so I will need to check the references for more information.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in **Table 1**, which summarizes the benchmark time series datasets used in the experiments. This table includes datasets like:

- **ECG Dataset**: Source not specified in the text, but it is likely from the UCI repository.
- **Libras Dataset**: Source not specified.
- **Wafer Dataset**: Source not specified.
- **Japanese Vowels Dataset**: Source not specified.
- **Arabic Digits Dataset**: Source not specified.
- **Auslan Dataset**: Source not specified.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. 

For the **EHR Dataset**, the citation is:
> Mikalsen, K. Ã˜., Bianchi, F. M., Soguero-Ruiz, C., Revhaug, A., & Jenssen, R. (2018). An Unsupervised Multivariate Time Series Kernel Approach for Identifying Patients with Surgical Site Infection from Blood Samples. ArXiv e-prints.

For the **Physionet Dataset**, the citation is:
> Clifford, G. D., Liu, C., Moody, B., Lehman, L. W., Silva, I., Li, Q., Johnson, A. E. W., & Mark, R. G. (2017). AF classification from a short single lead ECG recording: The PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017. Computing in Cardiology.

For the other datasets listed in Table 1, I will need to refer to the UCI and UCR repositories for their respective citations, as the paper does not provide them directly.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
