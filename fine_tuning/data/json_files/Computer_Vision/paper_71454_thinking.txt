To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Co-Speech Gesture Video Generation via Motion-Decoupled Diffusion Model" by Xu He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset called the **PATS dataset**, which is crucial for the experiments conducted in the study. This indicates that there is at least one dataset that I need to extract.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to gather more details about the datasets used. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they sourced their data from the **PATS dataset**, which consists of transcribed poses with aligned audios and text transcriptions, containing around 84,000 clips from 25 speakers. This section provides essential details about the dataset, including its size and the nature of the data it contains.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the PATS dataset. The paper cites the PATS dataset multiple times, and I will need to ensure I have the correct reference format. The citation for the PATS dataset is as follows:
> Chaitanya Ahuja, Dong Won Lee, Ryo Ishii, and Louis-Philippe Morency. *No gestures left behind: Learning relationships between spoken language and freeform gestures*. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing: Findings, pages 1884â€“1895, 2020.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **PATS Dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation in the paper. It consists of approximately 84,000 clips from 25 speakers, with a mean length of 10.7 seconds, totaling 251 hours of data.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset and its citation, ensuring that all details are accurately captured for future reference or processing.
