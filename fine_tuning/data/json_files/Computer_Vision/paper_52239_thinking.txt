To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Policy choices and outcomes for offshore wind auctions globally" by Malte Jansen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a "comprehensive global dataset" that provides an overview of auction schemes, which indicates that there are datasets to extract. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of the dataset in understanding auction mechanisms across various jurisdictions.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets. The **Approach section** outlines the methodology used to compile the dataset, indicating that it includes all executed auctions for offshore wind energy up to the end of 2021. This section will likely provide key details about the dataset, including its scope and the types of information it contains.

In the **Worldwide offshore wind energy auctions section**, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the auctions held globally, including tables that summarize auction outcomes and capacities. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that list specific datasets, as these will be crucial for my extraction.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The paper cites various sources that contributed to the dataset, and I need to ensure I capture these citations accurately.

From my review, I expect to identify at least one primary dataset:

1. **Global Offshore Wind Auction Dataset**: This dataset includes information on all executed offshore wind auctions, covering aspects such as jurisdiction, developer names, execution status, tender capacity, winning bids, support scheme types, and more. The dataset is derived from multiple sources, including Anatolitis and Roth (2020) and Jansen et al. (2020).

Next, I will compile the full citation for the dataset:

- For the **Global Offshore Wind Auction Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jansen, M., Beiter, P., Riepin, I., MÃ¼sgens, F., Juarez Guajardo-Fajardo, V., Staffell, I., Bulder, B., Kitzing, L. (2023). *Policy choices and outcomes for offshore wind auctions globally*. [DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.4672682](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4672682).

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I present the dataset details clearly and accurately, including the full citation, to maintain the integrity of the research and provide proper attribution. This structured approach will help me effectively extract and document the datasets from the paper.
