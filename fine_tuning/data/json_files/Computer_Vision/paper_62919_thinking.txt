To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identifying Interpretable Subspaces in Image Representations" by Neha Kalibhat et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a "large captioning dataset (like LAION-400m)" and a "probing dataset consisting of a diverse set of images (D)," which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used in the experiments. In this case, I will focus on the **methodology and experiments sections**. The paper explicitly states that they used **ImageNet-1K** as the probing dataset and **LAION-400m** as the captioning dataset. 

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe how they utilize these datasets for their framework, FALCON. They mention that ImageNet-1K is used for extracting highly activating images based on gradient activation, while LAION-400m is used for captioning these images.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **ImageNet-1K**: The citation is:
   > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., Berg, A. C., and Fei-Fei, L. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 115(3):211â€“252, 2015. doi: 10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y.

2. **LAION-400m**: The citation is:
   > Schuhmann, C., Vencu, R., Beaumont, R., Kaczmarczyk, R., Mullis, C., Katta, A., Coombes, T., Jitsev, J., and Komatsuzaki, A. *LAION-400m: Open dataset of clip-filtered 400 million image-text pairs*. 2021.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper attribution and further research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured output that is ready for review or downstream processing.
