To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Counterfactual Visual Explanations" by Yash Goyal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions applying the approach to multiple image classification datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for interpretability in machine learning and mention counterfactual explanations. However, I need to look for specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention four datasets:

1. **SHAPES Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as being created for classification using the code released by the authors of the original paper (Andreas et al., 2016).

2. **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, cited as LeCun et al. (1998).

3. **Omniglot Dataset**: This dataset contains images of handwritten characters from various writing systems, cited as Lake et al. (2015).

4. **Caltech-UCSD Birds (CUB) 2011 Dataset**: A dataset for fine-grained image classification of bird species, cited as Wah et al. (2011).

I will then verify the details of each dataset mentioned in the paper to ensure I have the correct information. The authors provide sufficient context and details about how each dataset is used in their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:

- For **SHAPES Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andreas, J., Rohrbach, M., Darrell, T., and Klein, D. *Neural module networks*. In CVPR, 2016.

- For **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., Haffner, P., et al. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For **Omniglot Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lake, B. M., Salakhutdinov, R., and Tenenbaum, J. B. *Human-level concept learning through probabilistic program induction*. Science, 350(6266):1332–1338, 2015.

- For **Caltech-UCSD Birds (CUB) 2011 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., and Belongie, S. *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*. Technical Report CNS-TR-2011-001, California Institute of Technology, 2011.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or processing.
