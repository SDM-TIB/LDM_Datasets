To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-To-End Latent Variational Diffusion Models for Inverse Problems in High Energy Physics" by Alexander Shmakov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of generative deep learning methods for reconstructing distributions of theoretical kinematic quantities, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention a specific dataset used for unfolding semi-leptonic top quark pair production:

1. **Semi-Leptonic t¯t Production Dataset**: This dataset is generated using the MADGRAPH_AMC@NLO simulator at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, with a total of 9,865,402 training events and 1,332,514 testing events. The dataset includes various kinematic variables for the partons involved in the process.

In addition, I will look for any references to other datasets or simulation tools used in the methodology. The authors mention using **PYTHIA8** and **DELPHES** for simulating particle interactions and detector responses, which are important for understanding the context of the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets and tools mentioned:

- For **MADGRAPH**, the citation is:
  > J. Alwall, R. Frederix, S. Frixione, V. Hirschi, F. Maltoni, O. Mattelaer, H. S. Shao, T. Stelzer, P. Torrielli, and M. Zaro. *The Automated Computation of Tree-level and Next-to-leading Order Differential Cross Sections, and Their Matching to Parton Shower Simulations*. JHEP, 07:079, 2014. doi: 10.1007/JHEP07(2014)079.

- For **PYTHIA8**, the citation is:
  > Torbjörn Sjöstrand, Stefan Ask, Jesper R. Christiansen, Richard Corke, Nishita Desai, Philip Ilten, Stephen Mrenna, Stefan Prestel, Christine O. Rasmussen, and Peter Z. Skands. *An introduction to PYTHIA 8.2*. Comput. Phys. Commun., 191:159–177, 2015. doi: 10.1016/j.cpc.2015.01.024.

- For **DELPHES**, the citation is:
  > J. de Favereau, C. Delaere, P. Demin, A. Giammanco, V. Lemaître, A. Mertens, and M. Selvaggi. *DELPHES 3, A Modular Framework for Fast Simulation of a Generic Collider Experiment*. JHEP, 02:057, 2014. doi: 10.1007/JHEP02(2014)057.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation for reference. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or citations related to the datasets used in the research.
