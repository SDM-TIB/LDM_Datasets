To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MINTIME: Multi-Identity Size-Invariant Video Deepfake Detection" by Davide Alessandro Coccomini et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on the **ForgeryNet dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the experiments conducted.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **evaluation section**. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they chose the **ForgeryNet dataset** for their experiments. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of videos, the distinction between pristine and manipulated videos, and the presence of multiple identities in some videos. This section confirms that **ForgeryNet** is the primary dataset used for their evaluations.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **ForgeryNet dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Yinan He, Bei Gan, Siyu Chen, Yichun Zhou, Guojun Yin, Luchuan Song, Lu Sheng, Jing Shao, and Ziwei Liu. *ForgeryNet: A versatile benchmark for comprehensive forgery analysis*. In CPVR, pages 4358â€“4367, 2021.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly used for training or evaluation, I will focus solely on the **ForgeryNet dataset**.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the necessary details, including the full citation, ensuring that it is ready for any structured output or further processing.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify potential datasets.
2. Confirm the dataset in the evaluation section.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references section.

This methodical approach ensures that I accurately capture the dataset information from the research paper.
