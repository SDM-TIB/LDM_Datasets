To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Random Splines for Point Process Intensity Estimation of Neural Population Data" by Gabriel Loaiza-Ganem et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a "newly collected dataset where a primate completes a pedaling task." This suggests that there is at least one dataset that is central to their research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 4 (Experiments)**. In this section, the authors describe their experiments and mention two datasets:

1. **Reaching Data**: This dataset consists of measurements of 20 neurons for 3590 trials during a reaching task performed by a primate. The authors mention that they randomly split the data into a training set with 3000 trials and a test set with the remaining trials.

2. **Cycling Data**: This dataset includes 1300 training trials and 188 test trials, where 20 neurons were recorded as the primate pedaled in a virtual environment. The authors specify that there are 8 trial types based on the direction and distance of pedaling.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the dataset collected by Churchland et al. for the reaching data, which I will need to cite properly.

The citation for the **Reaching Data** is:
> Churchland, M. M., Cunningham, J. P., Kaufman, M. T., Foster, J. D., Nuyujukian, P., Ryu, S. I., & Shenoy, K. V. (2012). Neural population dynamics during reaching. *Nature*, 487(7405), 51.

For the **Cycling Data**, since it is a newly collected dataset, I will note that it does not have a formal citation yet, but I will mention it as part of the study.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and citations in a clear format.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets:
1. **Reaching Data**: Measurements of 20 neurons for 3590 trials during a reaching task.
   - Citation: Churchland et al. (2012).
   
2. **Cycling Data**: A newly collected dataset consisting of 1300 training trials and 188 test trials during a pedaling task.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare it for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited.
