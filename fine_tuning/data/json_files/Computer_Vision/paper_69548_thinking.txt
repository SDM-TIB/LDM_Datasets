To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Magic-Me: Identity-Specific Video Customized Diffusion" by Ze Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used for experiments or comparisons.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they collected training images of 24 characters from **CustomConcept101** and from the internet. This indicates that **CustomConcept101** is a dataset used in their work.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and datasets in detail. Here, they confirm that they used images from **CustomConcept101** for training their model. They also mention generating prompts for animations against various backgrounds, but they do not specify additional datasets.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for **CustomConcept101**. However, the paper does not provide a direct citation for this dataset. I will need to search for it in the literature or online to ensure I have the correct reference.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details:

1. **CustomConcept101**: This dataset is mentioned as a source of training images for 24 characters. It is essential to provide a full citation for this dataset, which I will need to look up.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude my extraction process here. I will ensure that I have the correct citation for **CustomConcept101** before finalizing my dataset entry.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that the citation is accurate and complete.
