It includes five kinds of gearbox faults in each working state, including chipped tooth, missing tooth, root fault, surface fault, and healthy working state, divided into ten data files. Each file contains eight columns of vibration signals, with the third column indicating the vibration signal of the planetary gearbox in the Z-orientation, sampled at 2000Hz.",
