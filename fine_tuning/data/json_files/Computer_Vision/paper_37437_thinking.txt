To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FAST CONVOLUTIONAL NETS WITH fbfft: A GPU PERFORMANCE EVALUATION" by Nicolas Vasilache et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their performance on NVIDIA GPUs, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the experiments. The introduction discusses the performance of CNNs and mentions various frameworks but does not specify any datasets.

I will then look into the **experiments section** (which may be labeled differently, such as "Results" or "Evaluation") to find detailed information about the datasets used for performance evaluation. This section is crucial as it typically contains explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and characteristics.

If the paper includes a **section dedicated to datasets**, I will focus on that to gather specific details. I will look for any datasets that are used for training or testing the models, including their sizes, types, and any relevant annotations.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If the paper mentions any datasets but does not provide full citations, I will search for the original papers or sources of those datasets online to ensure I can provide accurate citations.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will allow for easy reference and use in future research or applications.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper while maintaining the importance of proper citation.
