To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Domestic Activities Clustering from Audio Recordings Using Convolutional Capsule Autoencoder Network" by Ziheng Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the method is evaluated on a public dataset adopted in DCASE-2018 Task 5, which suggests that there is a specific dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the experimental dataset. They mention that the dataset is publicly available and derived from the SINS dataset, collected by a network of 13 microphone arrays. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including that it contains audio clips of 9 daily domestic activities, with specific counts for each activity.

The authors provide a table (Table 3) that lists the domestic activities and the number of clips for each activity. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's structure and content.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the dataset in the **References section**. The authors reference the SINS dataset in reference [1], which is crucial for providing the complete citation for the dataset used in their experiments.

The citation for the SINS dataset is:
> G. Dekkers, S. Lauwereins, B. Thoen, et al. "The SINS database for detection of daily activities in a home environment using an acoustic sensor network," in Proc. of DCASE Workshop, 2017, pp. 32-36.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **SINS Dataset**: This dataset is used for domestic activities clustering and contains audio recordings of 9 daily domestic activities. The audio clips are divided into 10-second segments, and the dataset includes a total of 72,984 clips across various activities.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
