To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating 3D People in Scenes without People" by Yan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the generation of 3D human bodies and hints at the use of datasets for training and evaluation, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will look for detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their names, purposes, and any modifications made to them.

The paper mentions two primary datasets:

1. **PROX-E Dataset**: This dataset is an extension of the PROX-Qualitative (PROX-Q) dataset. It includes 3D human body meshes captured in indoor environments, with modifications such as the addition of virtual walls and semantic annotations. The authors state that they use this dataset as pseudo-ground truth for their study.

2. **MP3D-R Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the Matterport3D dataset and consists of 7 different rooms. The authors describe how they extract these rooms and capture snapshots using a virtual agent in the Habitat simulator.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **PROX-Qualitative (PROX-Q) dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mohamed Hassan, Vasileios Choutas, Dimitrios Tzionas, and Michael J. Black. *Resolving 3D human pose ambiguities with 3D scene constraints*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019.

- For the **Matterport3D dataset**, the citation is:
  > Angel Chang, Angela Dai, Thomas Funkhouser, Maciej Halber, Matthias Niessner, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Andy Zeng, and Yinda Zhang. *Matterport3D: Learning from RGB-D data in indoor environments*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV), 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
