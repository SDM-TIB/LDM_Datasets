To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodal deep learning for mapping forest dominant height by fusing GEDI with earth observation data" by Man Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data and materials sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) data, which is a key dataset for this research. 

Next, I will focus on the **data and materials section** where the authors describe the various datasets used in their study. This section is likely to provide detailed information about each dataset, including its purpose and characteristics.

1. **GEDI Data**: The paper discusses the GEDI Version 2 Level-2A (L2A) product, which provides vertical structure profiles for each footprint. This dataset is crucial for estimating forest height and is mentioned multiple times throughout the paper.

2. **Sentinel-2 Data**: The authors utilize Sentinel-2 Level-2A imagery for their analysis, which provides high-resolution optical imagery essential for vegetation analysis.

3. **Sentinel-1 Data**: The paper mentions the use of Sentinel-1 data, which is a radar imaging satellite that provides valuable information for forest structure analysis.

4. **ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 Data**: The authors also reference the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 dataset, which operates at L-band frequencies and is used for deeper penetration into the forest canopy.

5. **WorldCover Data**: The European Space Agency WorldCover product is mentioned as providing land cover classification based on Sentinel data.

6. **NASADEM Data**: The paper discusses the use of NASA's High-Resolution Digital Elevation Model (NASADEM) for topographic representation.

   Full citation for NASADEM:

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have accurately noted their descriptions and full citations. This will allow me to compile a comprehensive list of datasets used in the research, which can be formatted as needed for further processing or review.
