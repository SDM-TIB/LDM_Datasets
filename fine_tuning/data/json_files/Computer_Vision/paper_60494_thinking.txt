To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conditional Denoising Diffusion for Sequential Recommendation" by Yu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information accurately, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "four benchmark datasets," which indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to identify.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in section 5, where they mention using "four Amazon datasets" for their evaluations. This is a crucial detail that suggests the datasets are related to Amazon.

I will then locate the specific datasets mentioned in the paper. In section 5.1, the authors provide a list of the datasets used, which includes:

1. **Office Dataset**: This dataset is used for sequential recommendation tasks and is characterized by user interactions with items.
2. **Beauty Dataset**: Another dataset from Amazon, focusing on beauty products and user interactions.
3. **Tools and Home Dataset**: This dataset includes interactions related to tools and home improvement items.
4. **Toys and Games Dataset**: This dataset captures user interactions with toys and games.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the Amazon datasets are typically not provided in detail in the paper, but I can reference the original source of the datasets, which is often the Amazon product data.

For the Amazon datasets, I will use the following citation format, as they are commonly referenced in research:

- **Amazon Office Dataset**:

In Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, Santiago, Chile, August 9-13, 2015. ACM, 43–52.

- **Amazon Beauty Dataset**:
  > Julian J. McAuley, Christopher Targett, Qinfeng Shi, and Anton van den Hengel. *Image-Based Recommendations on Styles and Substitutes*. In Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, Santiago, Chile, August 9-13, 2015. ACM, 43–52.

- **Amazon Tools and Home Dataset**:
  > Julian J. McAuley, Christopher Targett, Qinfeng Shi, and Anton van den Hengel. *Image-Based Recommendations on Styles and Substitutes*. In Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, Santiago, Chile, August 9-13, 2015. ACM, 43–52.

- **Amazon Toys and Games Dataset**:
  > Julian J. McAuley, Christopher Targett, Qinfeng Shi, and Anton van den Hengel. *Image-Based Recommendations on Styles and Substitutes*. In Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, Santiago, Chile, August 9-13, 2015. ACM, 43–52.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
