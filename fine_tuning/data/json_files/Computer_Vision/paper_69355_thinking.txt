To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Noise Map Guidance: Inversion with Spatial Context for Real Image Editing" by Hansam Cho et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention any datasets used for evaluation or experimentation. The introduction often elaborates on the context of the research and may reference specific datasets that are relevant to the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. These sections typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any specific splits (e.g., training, validation, testing) that are relevant to the experiments conducted.

In this paper, I will pay close attention to any figures or tables that might summarize the datasets or their usage in experiments. If the authors refer to any datasets in the context of their experiments, I will note those down as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary attribution and allows others to locate the datasets for their own research.

For example, if the authors mention using the **MS-COCO dataset**, I would look for the citation in the references, which typically includes the authors, title, conference or journal name, and year of publication.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's details.

In summary, my step-by-step approach will be:
1. Read the **abstract** and **introduction** for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Look for a **datasets section** or references to datasets in the **methodology** and **experiments** sections.
3. Note any relevant figures or tables that summarize dataset usage.
4. Check the **References section** for full citations of each dataset.
5. Compile the information into a clear and structured format for each dataset, ensuring to include full citations.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in this research paper, providing complete citations for each.
