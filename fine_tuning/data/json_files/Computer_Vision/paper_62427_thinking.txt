To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Metric-aligned Sample Selection and Critical Feature Sampling for Oriented Object Detection" by Peng Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that extensive experiments were conducted on four challenging rotated object detection datasets: **DOTA, FAIR1M-1.0, HRSC2016, and UCAS-AOD**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will look into **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, I will find specific information about each dataset, including their characteristics and the number of instances or images they contain.

1. **DOTA**: The paper describes DOTA as a challenging dataset for oriented object detection in remote sensing images, containing 2,806 satellite optical images with a total of 188,282 instances across 15 common object categories. The citation for DOTA is:
   > G. S. Xia, X. Bai, J. Ding, Z. Zhu, S. Belongie, J. Luo, M. Datcu, M. Pelillo, and L. Zhang. *Dota: A large-scale dataset for object detection in aerial images*. In 2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2018.

2. **FAIR1M-1.0**: This dataset consists of 15,266 high-resolution images with more than 1 million instances for fine-grained object recognition. The citation for FAIR1M-1.0 is:
   > H. Sun, P. Wang, Z. Yan, F. Xu, R. Wang, W. Diao, J. Chen, J. Li, Y. Feng, T. Xu et al. *Fair1m: A benchmark dataset for fine-grained object recognition in high-resolution remote sensing imagery*. ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, vol. 184, pp. 116–130, 2022.

3. **HRSC2016**: This dataset contains 1,061 images collected from six well-known harbors, specifically for ship detection. The citation for HRSC2016 is:
   > Z. Liu, L. Yuan, L. Weng, and Y. Yang. *A high resolution optical satellite image dataset for ship recognition and some new baselines*. In International Conference on Pattern Recognition Applications and Methods, 2017.

4. **UCAS-AOD**: This dataset includes 1,510 images collected from Google Earth, with instances of planes and cars. The citation for UCAS-AOD is:
   > H. Zhu, X. Chen, W. Dai, K. Fu, Q. Ye, and J. Jiao. *Orientation robust object detection in aerial images using deep convolutional neural network*. In 2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP), pp. 3735–3739, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset, as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work or analysis.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
