To extract datasets from the research paper titled "More than Words: Linking Music Preferences and Moral Values through Lyrics" by Vjosa Preniqi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the study involves data harvested from a Facebook-hosted application, which suggests that there is a dataset related to user interactions and music preferences.

Next, I will focus on the **data collection section** (Section 3), where the authors describe the LikeYouth Facebook-hosted application. They mention that this application was used to collect data from 3,920 users, including psychometric scores and music artist Page Likes. This indicates that the LikeYouth dataset is central to their research.

In this section, the authors also specify that they analyzed moral values scores and Likes on music artist Pages, which further confirms the relevance of the LikeYouth dataset. They provide details about the demographic breakdown of the users, which is important for understanding the dataset's composition.

Additionally, I will look for any references to external datasets used in the study. The authors mention using the **Genius.com music database** to obtain lyrics from the top songs of the preferred music artists. This indicates that there is another dataset involved, specifically related to song lyrics.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **LikeYouth Dataset**: This dataset is described in detail in the paper, but it does not have a formal citation since it is a proprietary dataset created for the study. However, I will note that it is a Facebook-hosted application developed for research purposes.

2. **Genius.com Lyrics Dataset**: The authors used the Genius API to retrieve song lyrics. The citation for the Genius API is not explicitly provided in the paper, but I can reference the website:
   > Genius. *Genius API*. Available at: https://docs.genius.com/

After identifying these datasets and their descriptions, I will summarize the findings and prepare to format them according to the required structure.

In conclusion, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the study, including their descriptions and any relevant citations, to facilitate further analysis or replication of the research.
