To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enforcing perceptual consistency on Generative Adversarial Networks by using the Normalised Laplacian Pyramid Distance" by Alexander Hepburn et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a perceptual regulariser for image-to-image translation and hints at the evaluation of the method on public datasets. This suggests that datasets are likely to be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, the authors explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Facades Dataset**: This dataset consists of architectural label drawings and their corresponding color images. It is used for generating color images from semantic label maps.

2. **Cityscapes Dataset**: This dataset contains label maps and color images taken from a front-facing car camera, specifically designed for semantic urban scene understanding. The authors mention resizing images for their experiments.

3. **Maps Dataset**: Constructed by Isola et al., this dataset includes map layout images from Google Maps and their corresponding aerial images.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Facades Dataset**, the citation is:
  > P. Isola, J. Zhu, T. Zhou, and A. Efros. *Image-to-image translation with conditional adversarial networks*. In IEEE CVPR, 2017.

- For the **Cityscapes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Cordts, M. Omran, S. Ramos, T. Rehfeld, M. Enzweiler, R. Benenson, U. Franke, S. Roth, and B. Schiele. *The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In IEEE CVPR, pages 3213â€“3223, 2016.

- For the **Maps Dataset**, the citation is:
  > P. Isola, J. Zhu, T. Zhou, and A. Efros. *Image-to-image translation with conditional adversarial networks*. In IEEE CVPR, 2017. (Note: This dataset is referenced in the context of the pix2pix paper by Isola et al.)

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be clearly described along with its full citation to ensure proper attribution.
