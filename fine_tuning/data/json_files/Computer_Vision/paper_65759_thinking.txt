To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Noise-Free Score Distillation" by Oren Katzir et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it often hints at the data used for validation or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors typically discuss the context of their work and may reference datasets used in previous studies. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets that are relevant to their research.

Then, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where authors usually describe the datasets they utilized for their experiments. I will look for any subsections specifically dedicated to datasets or any mentions of datasets in the context of the experiments conducted.

If the paper includes a **results section**, I will also check there for any additional mentions of datasets, especially if the authors compare their results against benchmarks or previously established datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as I need to ensure that I provide complete and accurate citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like "Stable Diffusion" or "NeRF," I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets in detail. I will ensure to note down the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all relevant datasets from the research paper.
