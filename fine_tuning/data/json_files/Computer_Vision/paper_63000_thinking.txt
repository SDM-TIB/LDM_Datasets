To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Iterative Robust Visual Grounding with Masked Reference based Centerpoint Supervision" by Menghao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a new framework and mention "two newly proposed robust VG datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention both regular and robust VG datasets. I will carefully extract the names and descriptions of these datasets.

1. **Regular VG Datasets**: The authors list five datasets:
   - **RefCOCO**: Contains 19,994 images, 50,000 reference objects, and 142,210 reference expressions.
   - **RefCOCO+**: Comprises 19,992 images with 49,856 reference objects and 141,564 reference expressions.
   - **RefCOCOg**: Includes 25,799 images, 49,822 objects, and 95,010 reference expressions.
   - **ReferItGame**: Contains 20,000 images and 120,072 reference expressions.
   - **Flickr30k**: Comprises 31,783 images and 427,000 reference expressions.

2. **Robust VG Datasets**: The authors constructed two new datasets:
   - **RefCOCOg F**: A modified version of RefCOCOg that includes false-alarm data.
   - **ReferItGame F**: A modified version of ReferItGame that also includes false-alarm data.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the regular datasets are as follows:

- **RefCOCO**:
  > Licheng Yu, Patrick Poirson, Shan Yang, Alexander C. Berg, and Tamara L. Berg. *Modeling context in referring expressions*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2016.

- **RefCOCO+**:
  > Licheng Yu, Patrick Poirson, Shan Yang, Alexander C. Berg, and Tamara L. Berg. *Modeling context in referring expressions*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2016.

- **RefCOCOg**:
  > Junhua Mao, Jonathan Huang, Alexander Toshev, Oana Camburu, Alan L. Yuille, and Kevin Murphy. *Generation and comprehension of unambiguous object descriptions*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

- **ReferItGame**:
  > Sahar Kazemzadeh, Vicente Ordonez, Mark Matten, and Tamara L. Berg. *Referitgame: Referring to objects in photographs of natural scenes*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2014.

- **Flickr30k**:
  > Bryan A. Plummer, Liwei Wang, Chris M. Cervantes, Juan C. Caicedo, Julia Hockenmaier, and Svetlana Lazebnik. *Flickr30k entities: Collecting region-to-phrase correspondences for richer image-to-sentence models*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

For the robust datasets, since they are newly constructed, they may not have formal citations yet, but I will note their names and the fact that they are derived from existing datasets.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, ensuring that I have accurately represented each dataset's details as required.
