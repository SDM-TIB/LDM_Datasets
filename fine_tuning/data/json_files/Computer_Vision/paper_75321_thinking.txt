To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MBA-Net: SAM-driven Bidirectional Aggregation Network for Ovarian Tumor Segmentation" by Yifan Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on two datasets: a public multi-modality ovarian tumor ultrasound dataset and an in-house multi-site ovarian tumor MRI dataset. This indicates that there are at least two datasets to extract.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 3.1, the authors describe the datasets used for validation:

1. **Public Multi-modality Ovarian Tumor Ultrasound Dataset**: This dataset consists of various tumor types and is used for training and evaluating the model's performance. The authors mention that it includes images of seven different tumor types, which provides context about its diversity.

2. **In-house Multi-site Ovarian Tumor MRI Dataset**: This dataset comprises images from 493 patients across five medical centers, encompassing five distinct tumor types. The authors also note that ethical approval was granted for this study, which adds credibility to the dataset's use.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the public dataset as follows:

- For the **Multi-modality Ovarian Tumor Ultrasound Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Qi Zhao, Shuchang Lyu, Wenpei Bai, Linghan Cai, Binghao Liu, Meijing Wu, Xiubo Sang, Min Yang, and Lijiang Chen. *A multi-modality ovarian tumor ultrasound image dataset for unsupervised cross-domain semantic segmentation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2207.06799, 2022.

The in-house dataset does not have a specific citation since it is not publicly available, but I will note that it is derived from internal research.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Public Multi-modality Ovarian Tumor Ultrasound Dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluating the segmentation model, consisting of various tumor types.

2. **In-house Multi-site Ovarian Tumor MRI Dataset**: This dataset includes images from multiple medical centers and is used to assess the model's robustness.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the public dataset and note the in-house dataset's context. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all necessary information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
