To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GSO-YOLO: Global Stability Optimization YOLO for Construction Site Detection" by Yuming Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on datasets like SODA, MOCS, and CIS, which suggests that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **SODA Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 19,846 images and annotations for 286,201 objects across 15 categories relevant to construction sites.

2. **MOCS Dataset**: This dataset consists of 41,668 images collected from real construction sites, annotated for 13 categories of moving objects.

3. **CIS Dataset**: This dataset is designed for instance segmentation and contains 50,000 images with 10 object categories, including various types of workers and machinery.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **SODA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Duan, H. Deng, M. Tian, Y. Deng, and J. Lin. *SODA: Site Object Detection Dataset for Deep Learning in Construction*. 2022.

- For the **MOCS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Xuehui, Z. Li, L. Zuguang, W. Chengzhi, L. Pengfei, and L. Zhiwei. *Dataset and Benchmark for Detecting Moving Objects in Construction Sites*. Automation in Construction, vol. 122, p. 103482, 2021.

- For the **CIS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > X. Yan, H. Zhang, Y. Wu, C. Lin, and S. Liu. *Construction Instance Segmentation (CIS) Dataset for Deep Learning-Based Computer Vision*. Automation in Construction, vol. 156, p. 105083, 2023.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the paper.
