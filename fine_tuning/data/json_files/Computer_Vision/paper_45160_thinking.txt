To extract datasets from the research paper titled "InstaHide: Instance-hiding Schemes for Private Distributed Learning" by Yangsibo Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a "large public dataset (e.g. ImageNet)" for mixing, which indicates that ImageNet is one of the datasets involved. Additionally, the abstract refers to the release of a "challenge dataset" to encourage new attacks, suggesting that this dataset is also significant.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the context of their work and the datasets used. They mention that experiments were conducted on **MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet** datasets. This is crucial information as it identifies the datasets used for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide further details about the datasets. They confirm that they used **MNIST** for handwritten digit recognition, **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** for image classification tasks, and **ImageNet** as a large-scale dataset for training and evaluation. The paper also mentions that they released a challenge dataset of images encrypted using InstaHide, which is intended for further research and experimentation.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

   - Citation:

   - Citation:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
