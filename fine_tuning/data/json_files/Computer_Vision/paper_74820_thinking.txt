To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NerfBaselines: Consistent and Reproducible Evaluation of Novel View Synthesis Methods" by Jonas Kulhanek and Torsten Sattler, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on novel view synthesis and mentions the release of a web platform for comparing methods on standard benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors discuss the challenges in evaluating NeRF and 3DGS methods and hint at the need for standardized evaluation protocols, which may lead to the identification of specific datasets used in their experiments.

In the **evaluation section (Section 4)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Mip-NeRF 360 Dataset**: This dataset is referenced multiple times throughout the paper, particularly in the context of evaluating the performance of various methods. It is noted for its unbounded anti-aliased neural radiance fields.

2. **Blender Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned in the context of performance evaluation and is used to compare the results of different methods.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Mip-NeRF 360 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jonathan T Barron, Ben Mildenhall, Dor Verbin, Pratul P Srinivasan, and Peter Hedman. *Mip-NeRF 360: Unbounded Anti-Aliased Neural Radiance Fields*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2022.

- For the **Blender Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P Srinivasan, Matthew Tancik, Jonathan T Barron, Ravi Ramamoorthi, and Ren Ng. *NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.
