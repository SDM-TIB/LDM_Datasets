To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Spatio-Temporal Reasoning for Event-based Moving Object Detection" by Hanyu Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on various datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention conducting extensive experiments on both a public dataset and a self-collected dataset. 

In the **experiments section**, the authors specifically mention two datasets:

1. **EVIMO2 Dataset**: This is a public dataset used for event-based moving object detection. The authors describe it as containing various ego-motion patterns and fast-moving objects under different illumination conditions.

2. **VIE Dataset**: This is a self-collected dataset that includes paired RGB-event data with manually crafted moving object bounding box labels. The authors highlight that this dataset was created to verify the effectiveness of their proposed method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **EVIMO2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Anton Mitrokhin, Chengxi Ye, Cornelia Fermüller, Yiannis Aloimonos, and Tobi Delbruck. *EV-IMO: Motion Segmentation Dataset and Learning Pipeline for Event Cameras*. In 2019 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), pages 6105–6112, 2019.

- The **VIE Dataset** does not have a specific citation in the references, as it is a self-collected dataset by the authors. Therefore, I will note it as such in the dataset extraction.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **EVIMO2 Dataset**: A public dataset for event-based moving object detection, containing various ego-motion patterns and fast-moving objects under different illumination conditions.

2. **VIE Dataset**: A self-collected dataset with paired RGB-event data and manually crafted moving object bounding box labels.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all information is accurately represented for further processing or review.
