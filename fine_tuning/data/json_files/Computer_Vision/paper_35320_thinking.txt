To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Learning of Neural Networks to Explain Neural Networks" by Quanshi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors applied their method to different types of CNNs for evaluation, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for training and testing. In this section, they explicitly mention two benchmark datasets:

1. **CUB200-2011 Dataset**: This dataset contains 11.8K bird images of 200 species, with center positions of fifteen bird landmarks. The authors consider all 200 bird species as a single category for their experiments.

2. **Pascal-Part Dataset**: This dataset provides ground-truth segmentations of a total of 107 object parts for six animal categories. The authors use this dataset to evaluate filter interpretability.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **CUB200-2011 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*. Technical report, California Institute of Technology.

- For the **Pascal-Part Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chen, X., Mottaghi, R., Liu, X., Fidler, S., Urtasun, R., & Yuille, A. (2014). *Detect What You Can: Detecting and Representing Objects Using Holistic Models and Body Parts*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
