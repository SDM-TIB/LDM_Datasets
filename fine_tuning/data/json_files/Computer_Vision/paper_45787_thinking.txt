To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Temporal Convolution Network Approach to State-of-Charge Estimation in Li-ion Batteries" by Aniruddh Herle et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it mentions the use of a Temporal Convolution Network (TCN) for estimating State of Charge (SOC), it does not specify datasets. 

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section** where the authors describe the experiments conducted. Here, they mention using a dataset from a Panasonic 18650 battery cell subjected to various drive cycles. This indicates that there is a specific dataset being utilized.

In the **dataset section**, the authors provide more details about the dataset. They specify that the dataset used is from a Panasonic 18650 battery cell with lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (NCA) chemistry, tested under different drive cycles (HWFET, LA92, US06, and UDDS) at temperatures ranging from 0 °C to 25 °C. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and context for the experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors refer to a previous work by Chemali et al. [16], which is crucial for providing the complete citation for the dataset used in this study.

The citation for the dataset is:

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extracted from the paper:

1. **Dataset Name**: Panasonic 18650 Battery Dataset
   - **Description**: This dataset consists of data collected from a Panasonic 18650 battery cell with NCA chemistry, tested under various drive cycles (HWFET, LA92, US06, and UDDS) at temperatures ranging from 0 °C to 25 °C. It includes parameters such as voltage, current, temperature, and State of Charge (SOC).
   - **Full Citation**: E. Chemali, P. J. Kollmeyer, M. Preindl, R. Ahmed, and A. Emadi. *Long Short-Term Memory Networks for Accurate State-of-Charge Estimation of Li-ion Batteries*. IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, vol. 65, no. 8, pp. 6730–6739, 2018.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
