To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vertical Federated Image Segmentation" by Paul K. Mandal and Cole Leo, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their model on **369 images from the CamVid dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the **CamVid dataset**. They explain that CamVid is used for semantic segmentation tasks and consists of images captured from a vehicle driving through urban and suburban environments. This section confirms that the dataset is indeed utilized in their experiments.

In this section, the authors also mention that they performed binary classification to detect roads, which is a specific application of the CamVid dataset. This reinforces the importance of the dataset in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CamVid dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- For **CamVid Dataset**:
  > Brostow, G.J., Fauqueur, J., Cipolla, R. (2009). *Semantic object classes in video: A high-definition ground truth database*. Pattern Recognition Letters, 30(2), 88â€“97. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patrec.2008.04.005

Since the paper primarily discusses the CamVid dataset, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry for the CamVid dataset, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper attribution. This will allow for a structured and comprehensive representation of the dataset used in the research.
