To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Closing the Sim-to-Real Loop: Adapting Simulation Randomization with Real World Experience" by Yevgen Chebotar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of policies in two real-world tasks but does not explicitly name any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors mention the challenges of collecting real-world data and refer to using simulations, but again, no specific datasets are named.

Moving on to the **experiments** section, I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation. The authors describe two tasks: **swing-peg-in-hole** and **drawer opening**. I will check if they mention any datasets related to these tasks.

In the **experiments** section, the authors detail the tasks but do not provide specific dataset names. However, they mention using a **NVIDIA Flex** simulator for the experiments, which indicates that the data used for training might be generated through simulation rather than sourced from a traditional dataset.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional information regarding datasets. The appendices provide details about simulation parameters and the learning process but do not reference any external datasets.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to see if any cited works include datasets relevant to the tasks described. The references include various papers on reinforcement learning and robotics, but they do not specifically mention datasets.

Since the paper primarily discusses simulation-based training and does not reference any external datasets, I will conclude that there are no traditional datasets to cite. Instead, the authors rely on simulated data generated through their framework.

In summary, while I have thoroughly searched the paper for datasets, it appears that the authors did not utilize any external datasets but instead focused on simulation-generated data for their experiments. Therefore, I will document this finding accordingly.
