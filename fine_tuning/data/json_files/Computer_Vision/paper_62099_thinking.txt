To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distribution Shift Inversion for Out-of-Distribution Prediction" by Runpeng Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the experimental results are based on "multiple-domain generalization datasets and single-domain generalization datasets," indicating that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they mention:

1. **PACS Dataset**: This dataset contains 999 colored images from 7 classes and 4 domains (art painting, cartoon, photo, and sketch). It is used for evaluating the performance of their method in the context of out-of-distribution prediction.

2. **Office-Home Dataset**: This dataset consists of around 15,500 images from 65 different classes and 4 domains (artistic, clip art, product, and real-world). It is also utilized for testing the effectiveness of the proposed method.

3. **ImageNet-R Dataset**: A variant of ImageNet containing 30,000 images from 200 classes with different styles, used as a single-training domain classification benchmark.

4. **ImageNet Sketch Dataset**: Another variant of ImageNet with 50,000 sketch images collected from Google, used for testing.

5. **CdSprites-5 Dataset**: A variant of the DSprites dataset, which constructs a binary classification problem by selecting 2 shapes from DSprites, used to evaluate the method's performance under covariate shift and spurious correlation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
