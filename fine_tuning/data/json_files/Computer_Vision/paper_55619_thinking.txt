To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LATITUDE: Robotic Global Localization with Truncated Dynamic Low-pass Filter in City-scale NeRF" by Zhenxin Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on both synthetic and real-world data, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In this case, they refer to two datasets:

1. **Urban Minimum Altitude Dataset (UMAD)**: This dataset is created using the AirSim simulator and is designed to provide high-fidelity simulation data for urban environments. The authors emphasize that it includes realistic city scene models and drone trajectory data.

2. **Mill 19 Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a comparison point for their method, indicating that it is another dataset used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

- For the **Urban Minimum Altitude Dataset (UMAD)**, the citation is:
  > Zhenxin Zhu, Yuantao Chen, Zirui Wu, Chao Hou, Yongliang Shi, Chuxuan Li, Pengfei Li, Hao Zhao, Guyue Zhou. *Urban Minimum Altitude Dataset (UMAD)*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023.

- For the **Mill 19 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Haithem Turki, Deva Ramanan, and Mahadev Satyanarayanan. *Mega-nerf: Scalable construction of large-scale nerfs for virtual fly-throughs*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 12922â€“12931, June 2022.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or processing.
