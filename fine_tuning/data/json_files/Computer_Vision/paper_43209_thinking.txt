To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Games for Fairness and Interpretability" by Eric Chu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets or data sources. The abstract discusses the concept of "games for fairness and interpretability," which may imply the use of datasets generated from gameplay, but I need to confirm this in the main body of the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant sections that discuss the data used in their proposed games. In this paper, there is no explicit section labeled "Datasets," so I will need to look for mentions of datasets throughout the text, particularly in sections discussing the methodology or experiments.

In the **ML Powered Games** section, the authors describe various game types and their purposes, but they do not specify any existing datasets. Instead, they propose that these games will generate new datasets as a byproduct of gameplay. This indicates that the datasets are not pre-existing but will be created through the proposed games.

I will also check the **conclusion** and **future work** sections to see if the authors mention any specific datasets that could be used or generated in future research. They emphasize the importance of producing new datasets through gameplay, which aligns with their goal of engaging the public and improving machine learning models.

Since the paper does not reference any specific datasets that are already established, I will note that the datasets discussed are conceptual and will emerge from the proposed games rather than being sourced from existing datasets.

Finally, I will compile the information regarding the datasets, including the conceptual nature of the datasets generated from gameplay, and ensure to provide the full citation for the paper itself, as it is crucial for proper attribution.

In summary, I will document that the datasets discussed in this paper are generated through the proposed games rather than being pre-existing datasets, and I will ensure to include the citation for the paper itself.
