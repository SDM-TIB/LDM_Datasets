To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diversity-Sensitive Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks" by Dingdong Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method on three conditional generation tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their experiments in detail. Here, they mention using specific datasets for different tasks:

1. **Image-to-Image Translation**: The authors state that they evaluate their method on three datasets:
   - **Label→Image Dataset**: Cited as Radim Tyleček, 2013.
   - **Edge→Photo Dataset**: Cited as Zhu et al., 2016; Yu & Grauman, 2014.
   - **Map→Image Dataset**: Cited as Isola et al., 2017.

2. **Image Inpainting**: The authors mention using the **CelebA Dataset** (Liu et al., 2015) for training their inpainting model.

3. **Video Prediction**: The authors utilize two datasets:
   - **BAIR Action-Free Robot Pushing Dataset**: Cited as Ebert et al., 2017.
   - **KTH Human Actions Dataset**: Cited as Schuldt et al., 2004.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Label→Image Dataset**:
  > Radim Tyleček. *Spatial Pattern Templates for Recognition of Objects with Regular Structure*. In GCPR, 2013.

- For the **Edge→Photo Dataset**:
  > Xun Huang, Ming-Yu Liu, Serge Belongie, and Jan Kautz. *Multimodal Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation*. In ECCV, 2018.

- For the **Map→Image Dataset**:
  > Phillip Isola, Jun-Yan Zhu, Tinghui Zhou, and Alexei A. Efros. *Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks*. In CVPR, 2017.

- For the **CelebA Dataset**:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In ICCV, 2015.

- For the **BAIR Action-Free Robot Pushing Dataset**:
  > Frederik Ebert, Chelsea Finn, Alex X Lee, and Sergey Levine. *Self-Supervised Visual Planning with Temporal Skip Connections*. In CoRL, 2017.

- For the **KTH Human Actions Dataset**:
  > Christian Schuldt, Ivan Laptev, and Barbara Caputo. *Recognizing Human Actions: A Local SVM Approach*. In ICPR, 2004.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
