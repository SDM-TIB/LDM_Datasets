To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Not All Voxels Are Equal: Semantic Scene Completion from the Point-Voxel Perspective" by Xiaokang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their model's performance on two benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the importance of semantic scene completion and reference previous works. They mention that their method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two public benchmarks, which indicates that these benchmarks are likely datasets.

In the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **NYU Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,449 realistic indoor RGB-D scenes captured via a Kinect sensor. The authors reference the original work by Silberman et al. (2012) for this dataset.

2. **NYUCAD Dataset**: This is a synthetic dataset proposed by Firman et al. (2016) to avoid misalignments present in the NYU dataset. It is used for evaluating the performance of their method.

I will now check the **References section** to obtain the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **NYU Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Silberman, N., Hoiem, D., Kohli, P., & Fergus, R. (2012). *Indoor Segmentation and Support Inference from RGBD Images*. In ECCV.

- For the **NYUCAD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Firman, M., Mac Aodha, O., Julier, S., & Brostow, G. J. (2016). *Structured prediction of unobserved voxels from a single depth image*. In CVPR.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research.
