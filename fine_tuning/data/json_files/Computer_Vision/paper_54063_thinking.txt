To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Deep Autoencoder for Federated Learning" by David Novoa-Paradela et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the method has been evaluated using **seven real anomaly detection datasets**, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. In the results section, the authors provide a summary table (Table 1) that lists the datasets used, along with their characteristics. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Shuttle**: Size: 49,097; Anomalies: 3,511 (7.2%); Dimension: 9.
2. **Covertype**: Size: 286,048; Anomalies: 2,747 (1.0%); Dimension: 10.
3. **Pendigits**: Size: 6,870; Anomalies: 156 (2.3%); Dimension: 16.
4. **Cardio**: Size: 1,831; Anomalies: 176 (9.6%); Dimension: 21.
5. **Credit Card**: Size: 284,807; Anomalies: 492 (0.2%); Dimension: 29.
6. **Ionosphere**: Size: 351; Anomalies: 126 (35.9%); Dimension: 33.
7. **Optdigit**: Size: 5,216; Anomalies: 64 (2.9%); Dimension: 62.

I will now check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for each dataset directly, but I can look up the datasets individually to provide authoritative references. 

After researching, I find the following citations:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
