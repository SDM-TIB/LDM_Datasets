To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Usability of Deep Networks for Object-Based Image Analysis" by Nicolas Audebert et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize the **ISPRS Potsdam dataset** for vehicle detection and classification, which suggests that this dataset is significant to their work.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any additional context or details about the datasets. The authors mention the use of **PASCAL VOC2012** and **Microsoft COCO** as popular datasets for semantic segmentation, but my focus will be on the datasets specifically used in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used. The authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **ISPRS Potsdam Dataset**: This dataset consists of 38 RGB tiles (6000 × 6000 px) and associated IR and DSM images at a 5 cm spatial resolution. It provides a comprehensive ground truth for 24 tiles, which are used for semantic segmentation tasks.

2. **VEDAI Dataset**: This dataset contains 1268 RGB tiles (1024 × 1024 px) and associated IR images at a 12.5 cm spatial resolution. It includes annotations detailing the position of vehicles and their bounding boxes.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **ISPRS Potsdam Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Rottensteiner, F., Sohn, G., Jung, J., Gerke, M., Baillard, C., Benitez, S., and Breitkopf, U. (2012). The ISPRS benchmark on urban object classification and 3D building reconstruction. *ISPRS Annals of Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences*, 1, 3.

- For the **VEDAI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Razakarivony, S., and Jurie, F. (2016). Vehicle Detection in Aerial Imagery: A small target detection benchmark. *Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation*, 34, 187–203.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
