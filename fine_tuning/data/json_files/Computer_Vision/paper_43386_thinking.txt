To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Geometric Factors in Model Learning and Inference for Object Detection and Instance Segmentation" by Zhaohui Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed methods were applied to state-of-the-art instance segmentation and object detection models, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using popular benchmark datasets for their experiments. Specifically, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the context of the experiments conducted.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors have used the following datasets:

1. **MS COCO 2017**: This dataset is widely used for object detection and instance segmentation tasks. The authors mention that they trained their models on the MS COCO 2017 training set and evaluated them on the MS COCO 2017 validation set.

2. **PASCAL VOC 2007**: This dataset is another standard benchmark for object detection. The authors report results on the PASCAL VOC 2007 test set for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **MS COCO**, the citation is:
  > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In The European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014, pp. 740–755.

- For **PASCAL VOC**, the citation is:
  > M. Everingham, L. Van Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, vol. 88, no. 2, pp. 303–338, 2010.

Having gathered the dataset names and their full citations, I will now prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing.
