To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inner Space Preserving Generative Pose Machine" by Shuangjun Liu and Sarah Ostadabbas, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on a dataset, which suggests that there are specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Model Evaluation)**, where the authors explicitly discuss datasets. They mention the need for datasets that can satisfy their reposing purpose, specifically looking for pairs of images with the same background but different poses. They highlight the limitations of existing datasets and then mention the **SURREAL dataset** as a suitable option for their experiments.

In **section 5.1 (Dataset Description)**, the authors provide details about the SURREAL dataset, stating that it consists of synthesized humans with various appearance textures and backgrounds. They mention that the dataset contains a total of 54,265 video clips for training and 504 clips for evaluation. This section confirms that the SURREAL dataset is indeed used in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SURREAL dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Varol, G., Romero, J., Martin, X., Mahmood, N., Black, M.J., Laptev, I., & Schmid, C. (2017). *Learning from synthetic humans*. 2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2017).

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format. The key dataset extracted is:

1. **SURREAL Dataset**: A synthesized dataset of humans with various appearance textures and backgrounds, containing 54,265 training clips and 504 evaluation clips.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entry for the SURREAL dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will ensure that the dataset extraction is complete and properly documented for future reference.
