To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Binary Codes for Tagging X-Ray Images via Deep De-Noising Autoencoders" by Antonio Sze-To et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of building a Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) system for medical images and mention the need for large datasets. They reference the **IRMA dataset** as a benchmark dataset used in their experiments. This is a clear indication that I need to gather details about this dataset.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the methodology or results sections. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention the **IRMA dataset** in section IV (Results), where they describe its structure and the number of images it contains. They state that the IRMA dataset consists of 12,677 training images and 1,733 testing images, classified into 193 classes, with each class associated with a unique IRMA code.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the IRMA dataset. The paper cites the IRMA dataset as part of the ImageCLEFmed09 initiative. The citation is as follows:
> Tommasi, T., Caputo, B., Welter, P., Güld, M. O., & Deserno, T. M. (2010). Overview of the CLEF 2009 medical image annotation track. In Multilingual Information Access Evaluation II. Multimedia Experiments. Springer, pp. 85–93.

Since the IRMA dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format for clarity.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for any further processing or review.
