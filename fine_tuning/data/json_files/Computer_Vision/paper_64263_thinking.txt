To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NTU4DRadLM: 4D Radar-centric Multi-Modal Dataset for Localization and Mapping" by Jun Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper presents the NTU4DRadLM dataset, which is specifically designed for SLAM tasks and includes multiple sensors. This suggests that there may be detailed descriptions of the dataset in later sections.

Next, I will look into **section II (The NTU4DRadLM Dataset)**, where the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset. Here, they describe the dataset's characteristics, including the types of sensors used and the environments covered. They mention that the dataset includes six different routes collected under various conditions, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope.

In **subsection C (Data Collection)**, the authors detail the six datasets collected using two platforms (handcart and car) and provide specific names and lengths for each route. The datasets are:

1. **cp (Carpark)**: Length of 246 m, collected at approximately 1 m/s.
2. **garden**: Length of 339 m, collected at approximately 1 m/s.
3. **nyl (Nanyang Link)**: Length of 1017 m, collected at approximately 1 m/s.
4. **loop 1**: Length of 6.95 km, collected at approximately 25-30 km/h.
5. **loop 2**: Length of 4.79 km, collected at approximately 25-30 km/h.
6. **loop 3**: Length of 4.23 km, collected at approximately 25-30 km/h.

Each dataset is described in terms of its environment (structured, unstructured, semi-structured) and whether GPS data is included.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors do not provide separate citations for each dataset since they are part of the NTU4DRadLM dataset. However, they do reference their own work and other relevant literature that may be useful for citation purposes.

The citation for the NTU4DRadLM dataset itself is:
> Jun Zhang, Huayang Zhuge, Yiyao Liu, Guohao Peng, Zhenyu Wu, Haoyuan Zhang, Qiyang Lyu, Heshan Li, Chunyang Zhao, Dogan Kircali, Sanat Mharolkar, Xun Yang, Su Yi, Yuanzhe Wang, and Danwei Wang. *NTU4DRadLM: 4D Radar-centric Multi-Modal Dataset for Localization and Mapping*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2023.

Since the datasets are part of a single comprehensive dataset, I will compile the information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, length, and characteristics, along with the citation for the NTU4DRadLM dataset.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
