To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FBA Matting" by Marco Forte and François Pitié, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on the **Adobe Composition-1k dataset** for alpha matte and composite color quality. This indicates that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the introduction, the authors discuss the importance of alpha matting and the challenges involved, but they do not provide specific dataset names yet.

Upon reaching **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, the authors explicitly mention using the **Adobe Composition-1k dataset** for testing. They describe this dataset as containing 1000 testing images and provide details about the ground truth foreground images and alpha mattes. This confirms its relevance to their experiments.

Additionally, I will check the **training dataset** section, where the authors mention using the **Deep Image Matting dataset** constructed by Xu et al. This dataset consists of 431 foreground and alpha channel pairs, which were created using the compositing equation with backgrounds from the MSCOCO dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **Adobe Composition-1k dataset**:
   > Xu, N., Price, B., Cohen, S., Huang, T. (2017). *Deep Image Matting*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2970-2979.

2. **Deep Image Matting dataset**:
   > Xu, N., Price, B., Cohen, S., Huang, T. (2017). *Deep Image Matting*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2970-2979. (Note: This dataset is part of the same paper as the Adobe Composition-1k dataset.)

3. **MSCOCO dataset**:
   > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., Zitnick, C.L. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740-755.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring that I include the necessary details and citations for each dataset. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
