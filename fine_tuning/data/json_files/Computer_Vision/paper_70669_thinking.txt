To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Spatiotemporal Inconsistency via Thumbnail Layout for Face Deepfake Detection" by Yuting Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly list several datasets used for their experiments in section 4.1 (Setup). I will carefully note each dataset mentioned, along with any relevant details provided about them.

The datasets identified in the paper are:

1. **FaceForensics++ (FF++)**: A benchmark dataset consisting of 1,000 real videos and 4,000 fake videos across four different manipulation techniques. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Andreas Rossler, Davide Cozzolino, Luisa Verdoliva, Christian Riess, Justus Thies, and Matthias Niessner. *FaceForensics++: Learning to Detect Manipulated Facial Images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 1–11, 2019.

2. **Celeb-DF (CDF)**: A dataset containing 5,693 deepfake videos generated from celebrities. The citation is:
   > Yuezun Li, Xin Yang, Pu Sun, Honggang Qi, and Siwei Lyu. *Celeb-DF: A Large-Scale Challenging Dataset for Deepfake Forensics*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3207–3216, 2020.

3. **DeepFake Detection Challenge (DFDC)**: A large-scale dataset with 124,000 videos from 3,426 paid actors. The citation is:
   > Brian Dolhansky, Joanna Bitton, Ben Pflaum, Jikuo Lu, Russ Howes, Menglin Wang, and Cristian Canton Ferrer. *The Deepfake Detection Challenge (DFDC) Dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.07397, 2020.

4. **FaceShifter (FSh)**: A dataset that generates high-fidelity swapped faces based on 1,000 original videos from FF++. The citation is:
   > Lingzhi Li, Jianmin Bao, Hao Yang, Dong Chen, and Fang Wen. *Advancing High Fidelity Identity Swapping for Forgery Detection*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 5074–5083, 2020.

5. **DeeperForensics (DFo)**: A dataset containing 60,000 videos with 17.6 million frames for deepfake detection. The citation is:
   > Liming Jiang, Ren Li, Wayne Wu, Chen Qian, and Chen Change Loy. *DeeperForensics-1.0: A Large-Scale Dataset for Real-World Face Forgery Detection*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2889–2898, 2020.

6. **Wild-Deepfake (Wild-DF)**: A dataset with 7,314 facial sequences extracted from 707 deepfake videos. The citation is:
   > Bojia Zi, Minghao Chang, Jingjing Chen, Xingjun Ma, and Yu-Gang Jiang. *WildDeepfake: A Challenging Real-World Dataset for Deepfake Detection*. In Proceedings of the ACM Multimedia Conference (ACM MM), pages 2382–2390, 2020.

7. **KoDF**: A large-scale deepfake detection dataset containing 175,776 fake clips and 62,166 real clips of 403 Korean subjects. The citation is:
   > Patrick Kwon, Jaeseong You, Gyuhyeon Nam, Sungwoo Park, and Gyeongsu Chae. *KoDF: A Large-Scale Korean Deepfake Detection Dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 10744–10753, 2021.

8. **Deepfakes LSUN-Bedroom (DLB)**: A dataset that includes images generated by various diffusion models and GANs. The citation is:
   > Jonas Ricker, Simon Damm, Thorsten Holz, and Asja Fischer. *Towards the Detection of Diffusion Model Deepfakes*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.14571, 2022.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
