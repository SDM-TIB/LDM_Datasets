To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "ECGDETECT: Detecting Ischemia via Deep Learning" by Atandra Burman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the study's purpose and mentions the development of a machine learning model using data from the LTST database, which indicates that this database is one of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Method)**, specifically **subsection 2.1 (Data Set)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, I will find two datasets explicitly mentioned:

1. **LTST Database**: The authors describe this as a Long-term ST database from Physionet, containing 20-24 hour ambulatory ECG recordings. They mention the sampling rate and the annotation process, which provides important context about the dataset.

2. **RCE-India Data Collection Protocol**: This dataset is described as a collection of ECG samples from patients in India, detailing the number of patients, age group, and study design. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and application.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **LTST Database**, I will look for the original source or paper that describes this dataset. The citation is:
  > "Long-Term ST Database." PhysioNet. Available at: https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/ltstdb/

- For the **RCE-India Data Collection Protocol**, since it appears to be a proprietary dataset developed by the authors, I will note that it may not have a formal citation but can be referenced as follows:
  > Burman, A., Titus, J., Gbadebo, D., & Burman, M. (2020). RCE-India Data Collection Protocol. Unpublished dataset.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will allow me to create a structured output that accurately reflects the datasets used in the study.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset.
