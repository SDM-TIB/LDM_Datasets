To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion Approximations for a Class of Sequential Testing Problems" by Victor Araman and Ren√© Caldentey, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Experiments," "Data," or "Methodology."** In these sections, the authors often describe the datasets used for their experiments, including details about their size, structure, and any relevant characteristics.

As I read through these sections, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names and descriptions. If the authors refer to specific datasets without providing full citations, I will check the **References section** to find the complete citations for those datasets.

For each dataset identified, I will ensure to gather the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details (e.g., number of samples, features).
3. **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset, which may include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have compiled this information, I will format it according to the required structure, ensuring that each dataset entry includes the name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will review the extracted information for accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset documentation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets from the paper effectively.
