To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fixed-point Inversion for Text-to-image diffusion models" by Barak Meiri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of diffusion models and mentions experiments, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors evaluate their method. This section typically contains explicit mentions of datasets used for testing and validation. I will look for any specific dataset names, descriptions, and the context in which they are used.

Upon reviewing the experiments, I find that the authors mention using the **MS-COCO-2017 validation dataset** for image reconstruction tasks. They specify that this dataset consists of 5000 images along with their corresponding captions, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's application in their research.

Additionally, the authors refer to the **LAION-5B dataset** in the context of rare concept generation, indicating that this dataset is used to train diffusion models and assess their performance on generating rare concepts.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **MS-COCO-2017 validation dataset**, the citation is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr DollÃ¡r, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In ECCV, 2014.

2. For the **LAION-5B dataset**, the citation is:
   > Christoph Schuhmann, Romain Beaumont, Richard Vencu, Cade Gordon, Ross Wightman, Mehdi Cherti, Theo Coombes, Aarush Katta, Clayton Mullis, Mitchell Wortsman, et al. *LAION-5B: An open large-scale dataset for training next generation image-text models*. NeurIPS, 2022.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
