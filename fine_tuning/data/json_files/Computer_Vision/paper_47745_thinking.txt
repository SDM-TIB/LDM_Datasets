To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Implicit Statistical Shape Models for 3D Medical Image Delineation" by Ashwin Raju et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract highlights the evaluation of the proposed method on a **pathological liver segmentation task** and mentions a **larynx dataset** for supplemental validation. This indicates that there are at least two datasets of interest.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which provides detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, the authors mention the **MSD liver dataset** and the **larynx dataset**. I will extract the relevant details about these datasets:

1. **MSD Liver Dataset**: The paper states that this dataset consists of a size-131 training set, which is split into training, testing, and validation sets with proportions of 70%, 20%, and 10%, respectively. The dataset is used for delineating pathological livers from venous-phase CT scans.

2. **Larynx Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as containing 142 non-contrast CT images from head and neck cancer patients, specifically used for larynx segmentation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **MSD liver dataset**, the citation is:
  > Simpson, A. L., et al. (2019). A large annotated medical image dataset for the development and evaluation of segmentation algorithms. CoRR, abs/1902.09063.

- For the **larynx dataset**, the citation is:
  > Guo, D., Jin, D., Zhu, Z., Ho, T.-Y., Harrison, A. P., Chao, C.-H., Xiao, J., & Lu, L. (2020). Organ at Risk Segmentation for Head and Neck Cancer Using Stratified Learning and Neural Architecture Search. In Proceedings of the Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), 4223â€“4232.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will facilitate easy access and understanding for anyone interested in the datasets used in this research.
