To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Classification of High-Dimensional Spectroscopy Data Using Deep Learning and Data Synthesis" by James Houston, Frank G. Glavin, and Michael G. Madden, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on classifying chemical samples based on their Raman spectra, which suggests that a dataset related to Raman spectra is likely involved.

Next, I will examine the **dataset section** (which appears to be labeled as "Dataset and Classification Algorithms") to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. In this section, the authors mention the principal dataset comprising **230 Raman spectra of solvents and solvent mixtures**. This dataset is crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

The paper also discusses an **outlier dataset** that includes **24 Raman spectra of carbohydrates**. This dataset is used to test the robustness of the classification models against negative outliers.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For the **principal dataset**:
   - The dataset was originally compiled for research conducted by Conroy et al. (2005):
     > Conroy, J.; Ryder, A. G.; Leger, M. N.; Hennessey, K.; Madden, M. G. Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis of Chlorinated Solvents using Raman Spectroscopy and Machine Learning. Opto-Ireland 2005: Optical Sensing and Spectroscopy 2005, 5826, 131â€“143.

2. For the **outlier dataset**:
   - The outlier dataset is based on the SPECARB database:
     > SPECARB: Raman Spectra of Carbohydrates. http://www.models.life.ku.dk/~specarb/specarb.html, Accessed: June 2018.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured output that is ready for review or further processing.
