To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Energy-based Model via Dual-MCMC Teaching" by Jiali Cui and Tian Han, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their method on standard datasets such as **CIFAR-10**, **CelebA-64**, **CelebA-HQ-256**, and **LSUN-Church-64**. I will note down these datasets and any relevant details provided about them.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide performance metrics for their method on these datasets, which confirms their usage. I will also check the **related work and references sections** to find full citations for these datasets.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset:

1. **CIFAR-10**: The citation for CIFAR-10 is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

2. **CelebA-64**: The citation for CelebA-64 is:
   > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. CoRR, abs/1411.7766, 2014. URL http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7766.

3. **CelebA-HQ-256**: The citation for CelebA-HQ-256 is:
   > Tero Karras, Timo Aila, Samuli Laine, and Jaakko Lehtinen. *Progressive growing of gans for improved quality, stability, and variation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.10196, 2017.

4. **LSUN-Church-64**: The citation for LSUN-Church-64 is:
   > Fisher Yu, Yinda Zhang, Shuran Song, Ari Seff, and Jianxiong Xiao. *LSUN: Construction of a large-scale image dataset using deep learning with humans in the loop*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.03365, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented each dataset along with its full citation, as this is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or downstream processing, ensuring that all relevant details are included.
