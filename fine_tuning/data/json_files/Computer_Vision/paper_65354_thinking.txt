To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeltaSpace: A Semantic-aligned Feature Space for Flexible Text-guided Image Editing" by Yueming Lyu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for any specific dataset names or references in these sections.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using the **FFHQ dataset** and **CelebA-HQ dataset** for training and evaluation. They also refer to the **LSUN dataset** for additional evaluations. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their purpose and any specific characteristics mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets easily.

1. **FFHQ Dataset**: The authors mention using 58,000 images from the FFHQ dataset for training and 12,000 images for evaluation. The citation for the FFHQ dataset is:
   > T. Karras, T. Aila, S. Laine, and J. Lehtinen. *Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability, and Variation*. In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2018.

2. **CelebA-HQ Dataset**: The authors use CelebA-HQ images for evaluation. The citation for the CelebA-HQ dataset is:
   > T. Karras, T. Aila, S. Laine, and J. Lehtinen. *Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability, and Variation*. In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2018.

3. **LSUN Dataset**: The authors mention using the LSUN dataset for additional evaluations. The citation for the LSUN dataset is:
   > F. Yu, A. Seff, Y. Zhang, S. Song, T. Funkhouser, and J. Xiao. *LSUN: Construction of a Large-Scale Image Dataset Using Deep Learning with Humans in the Loop*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.03365, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
