To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to reconstruct the bubble distribution with conductivity maps using Invertible Neural Networks and Error Diffusion" by N. Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of Invertible Neural Networks (INNs) for reconstructing conductivity maps, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will look for specific references to datasets in the introduction and methods sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of bubble detection in electrolysis cells and mention the use of external magnetic field sensors. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly the **simulation setup and data pre-processing** subsection. Here, the authors describe how they generated their dataset for training and testing the INN model. They mention using a proof-of-concept simulation setup by Krause et al. (2023) to create the dataset, which consists of simulated conductivity distributions based on various geometrical configurations.

The authors state that they simulated the electric conductivity distributions of **10,000 different geometrical configurations** with a fixed applied current strength. They also mention that they selected **510 data points** directly above the sensor positions for training the INN model. This indicates that the dataset is derived from a simulation rather than a publicly available dataset.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the source of the dataset. The authors reference the simulation setup from Krause et al. (2023), which is crucial for providing the full citation of the dataset.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Krause, L., Kumar, N., Wondrak, T., Gumhold, S., Eckert, S., & Eckert, K. (2023). Current Tomography--Localization of void fractions in conducting liquids by measuring the induced magnetic flux density. arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.11540.

Since the dataset is based on a simulation and not a traditional dataset, I will note that the dataset is derived from the simulation described in the paper by Krause et al. (2023).

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information:
1. **Dataset Name**: Simulated Conductivity Distributions
   - **Description**: The dataset consists of simulated electric conductivity distributions based on 10,000 different geometrical configurations, with 510 data points selected for training the INN model.
   - **Citation**: Krause, L., Kumar, N., Wondrak, T., Gumhold, S., Eckert, S., & Eckert, K. (2023). Current Tomography--Localization of void fractions in conducting liquids by measuring the induced magnetic flux density. arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.11540.

After compiling this information, I will prepare it for structured output as needed.
