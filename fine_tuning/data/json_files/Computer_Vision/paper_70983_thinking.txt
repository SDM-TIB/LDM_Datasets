To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Task Unification in Graph Representation Learning via Generative Approach" by Yulan Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their method through extensive experiments on **21 datasets across four types of graph tasks**. This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the methodology section, the authors describe their approach and mention using various datasets for node-level, edge-level, and graph-level tasks. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets used.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors conduct experiments on several datasets for different tasks. They mention specific datasets for node classification, link prediction, graph classification, and transfer learning. I will compile a list of these datasets, ensuring to note their characteristics and the context in which they are used.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution. The paper references several datasets, including:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset used for node classification.
   - Citation: > Thomas N. Kipf and Max Welling. *Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2017.

2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network dataset for node classification.
   - Citation: > Thomas N. Kipf and Max Welling. *Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2017.

3. **Pubmed**: A dataset for node classification in biomedical literature.
   - Citation: > Thomas N. Kipf and Max Welling. *Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2017.

4. **ZINC15**: A dataset used for molecular property prediction in transfer learning.
   - Citation: > Teague Sterling and John J Irwin. *ZINC 15â€“ligand discovery for everyone*. Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, 2015.

5. **PROTEINS**: A dataset for graph classification tasks.
   - Citation: > Nino Shervashidze et al. *Weisfeiler-Lehman Graph Kernels*. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 2011.

6. **MUTAG**: A dataset for graph classification.
   - Citation: > H. D. H. et al. *Molecular Graphs and Their Applications*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning, 2019.

7. **IMDB-B**: A dataset for graph classification.
   - Citation: > Pinar Yanardag and S.V.N. Vishwanathan. *Deep Graph Kernels*. In Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described, including its purpose, characteristics, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.

Finally, I will compile all the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and review.
