To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KGAT: Knowledge Graph Attention Network for Recommendation" by Xiangnan He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three public benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Amazon-book**: This dataset is derived from Amazon reviews and is widely used for product recommendation. It includes user-item interactions and knowledge graph data, with specific statistics provided.

2. **Last-FM**: This dataset is collected from the Last.fm online music system, where tracks are treated as items. The authors specify that they used a subset of the dataset from January to June 2015, applying a 10-core setting for data quality.

3. **Yelp2018**: This dataset is from the 2018 Yelp challenge, focusing on local businesses like restaurants and bars. Similar to the other datasets, a 10-core setting is applied to ensure quality.

In the same section, the authors provide detailed statistics for each dataset, including the number of users, items, interactions, entities, relations, and triplets. This information is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of each dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Amazon-book**, the citation is:
  > J. McAuley and J. Leskovec. *From Amateurs to Connoisseurs: Modeling the Evolution of User Expertise through Online Reviews*. In Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), pages 897â€“908, 2014. 

- For **Last-FM**, the citation is:
  > J. Leskovec, L. Adamic, and B. Huberman. *The Dynamics of Viral Marketing*. ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB), 1(1):5, 2007.

- For **Yelp2018**, the citation is:
  > Yelp Dataset Challenge. *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. 2018. Available at: https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
