To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simple Unsupervised Multi-Object Tracking" by Shyamgopal Karthik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention achieving state-of-the-art performance on popular datasets like **MOT16/17**, which indicates that these datasets are relevant to their work.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically section 4) where the authors discuss their evaluation methodology. In **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, they explicitly state that they evaluate their performance on the **MOT Challenge**, which includes the **MOT16** and **MOT17** datasets. They describe these datasets as containing challenging pedestrian tracking sequences with various complexities.

To ensure I have the correct details, I will also check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MOT16**, the citation is:
  > Milan, A., Leal-Taixé, L., Reid, I., Roth, S., & Schindler, K. (2016). *MOT16: A benchmark for multi-object tracking*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1603.00831.

- For **MOT17**, the citation is:
  > Milan, A., Leal-Taixé, L., Reid, I., Roth, S., & Schindler, K. (2017). *MOT17: A benchmark for multi-object tracking*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.00424.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **MOT16**: A benchmark dataset for multi-object tracking that includes challenging pedestrian tracking sequences.
2. **MOT17**: Another benchmark dataset for multi-object tracking, providing additional public detections and more accurate ground truth compared to MOT16.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
