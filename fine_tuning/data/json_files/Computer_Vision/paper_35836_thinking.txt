To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simultaneous Compression and Quantization: A Joint Approach for Efficient Unsupervised Hashing" by Tuan Hoang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted comprehensive experiments on unsupervised image retrieval, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets, Evaluation protocols, and Implementation notes)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will identify each dataset mentioned and take note of their descriptions and any relevant details provided.

The paper lists three datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset contains 60,000 fully-annotated color images of 32 × 32 pixels from 10 object classes. The authors specify that the provided test set (1,000 images for each class) is used as the query set, while the remaining 50,000 images are used for training and as the database.

2. **LabelMe-12-50k Dataset**: This dataset consists of 50,000 fully annotated color images of 256 × 256 pixels from 12 object classes. The authors mention that the test set is used as the query set, and the remaining images serve as the training set and database.

3. **SUN397 Dataset**: This dataset contains approximately 108,000 fully annotated color images from 397 scene categories. The authors constructed a subset of approximately 35,000 images by selecting 42 categories with more than 500 images each. They also mention that 100 images per class are randomly sampled to form the query set.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
  > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Technical report, University of Toronto.

- For **LabelMe-12-50k Dataset**:
  > Russell, B.C., Torralba, A., Murphy, K.P., & Freeman, W.T. (2008). Labelme: A database and web-based tool for image annotation. International Journal of Computer Vision, 157-173.

- For **SUN397 Dataset**:
  > Xiao, J., Ehinger, K.A., Hays, J., Torralba, A., & Oliva, A. (2016). SUN database: Exploring a large collection of scene categories. International Journal of Computer Vision.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
