To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unleashing the Potential of SAM for Medical Adaptation via Hierarchical Decoding" by Zhiheng Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of "limited samples" and "various medical datasets," which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three specific datasets:

1. **Synapse Multi-Organ CT Dataset**: This dataset is from the MICCAI 2015 Multi-Atlas Abdomen Labeling Challenge and contains 3,779 axial contrast-enhanced abdominal CT images. The training set consists of 2,212 axial slices, and the authors evaluate eight abdominal organs.

2. **Left Atrial (LA) Dataset**: This dataset is from the 2018 Atrial Segmentation Challenge and is split into 80 scans for training and 20 scans for evaluation. The authors use only 4 labeled scans for training, treating the rest as unlabeled data.

3. **PROMISE2012 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 50 3D transversal T2-weighted MR images of the prostate, with manual binary prostate gland segmentation. The authors follow specific data split and preprocessing protocols for their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Synapse Multi-Organ CT Dataset**:

Medical Image Analysis, 18(2):359–373, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
