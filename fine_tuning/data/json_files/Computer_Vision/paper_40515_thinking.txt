To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning for Detecting Building Defects Using Convolutional Neural Networks" by Husein Perez, Joseph H. M. Tah, and Amir Mosavi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, which includes the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for detecting building defects. This suggests that there may be datasets related to images of building defects.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Methodology)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they collected images from various sources, including mobile phones and copyright-free images from the internet. They specify that the dataset consists of a total of **2622 images**, categorized into four classes: normal, mould, stain, and paint deterioration.

The authors provide detailed information about the distribution of images across these categories:
- Mould: 534 images
- Stain: 449 images
- Paint deterioration: 411 images
- Normal: 496 images

They also mention that **1890 images** were used for training, with **382 images** set aside for validation, and **732 images** for testing. This detailed breakdown confirms the existence of a structured dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the dataset itself, as it appears to be a custom dataset created by the authors. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is derived from various sources, including images taken by the authors and publicly available images.

To summarize, the dataset extracted from the paper is as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: Custom dataset for building defect detection
- **Description**: A collection of 2622 images categorized into four classes: normal, mould, stain, and paint deterioration, used for training a CNN model.
- **Citation**: Since the dataset is not formally published, I will note it as:
  > Perez, H., Tah, J. H. M., & Mosavi, A. (2023). Deep Learning for Detecting Building Defects Using Convolutional Neural Networks. *Oxford Institute for Sustainable Development, School of the Built Environment, Oxford Brookes University*.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
