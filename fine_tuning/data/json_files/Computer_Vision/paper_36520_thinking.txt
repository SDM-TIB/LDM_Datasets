To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalization and Equilibrium in Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs)" by Sanjeev Arora et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the training of GANs and mentions empirical evaluations, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and testing the models. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is widely used for handwritten digit recognition and contains 60,000 labeled 28x28 images of handwritten digits.

2. **CelebA Dataset**: This dataset consists of over 200,000 images of celebrity faces, each annotated with 40 attribute labels.

3. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset contains 60,000 labeled 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher JC Burges. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. 1998.

- For the **CelebA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 3730â€“3738, 2015.

- For the **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, 2009.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further analysis or integration into other systems.
