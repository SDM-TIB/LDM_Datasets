To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A novel asymmetrical autoencoder with a sparsifying discrete cosine Stockwell transform layer for gearbox sensor data compression" by Xin Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method is evaluated on two gearbox datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets: the **Southeast University (SEU) gearbox dataset** and the **University of Connecticut (UoC) gear fault dataset**. I will gather detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were used in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide specific details about each dataset:

1. **Southeast University (SEU) gearbox dataset**: This dataset is collected from a Drivetrain Dynamic Simulator and contains two working states at different rotating speeds (20Hz and 30Hz). It includes five types of gearbox faults and is divided into ten data files, with each file containing eight columns of vibration signals sampled at 2000Hz.

2. **University of Connecticut (UoC) gear fault dataset**: This dataset records nine different gear fault types, including missing tooth and root crack, sampled at 20 kHz. The authors specifically mention using chipping tips with two severity levels for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Southeast University (SEU) gearbox dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shao, S., McAleer, S., Yan, R., & Baldi, P. (2018). Mechanical-datasets. Retrieved from https://github.com/cathysiyu/Mechanical-datasets.

- For the **University of Connecticut (UoC) gear fault dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cao, P., Zhang, S., & Tang, J. (2018). Gear fault data. Retrieved from https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6127874.v1.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I have accurately represented the datasets used in the research.
