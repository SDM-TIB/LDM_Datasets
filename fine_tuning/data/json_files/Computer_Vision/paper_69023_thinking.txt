To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Media2Face: Co-speech Facial Animation Generation With Multi-Modality Guidance" by Qingcheng Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the **M2F-D dataset**, which is described as a large, diverse, and scan-level co-speech 3D facial animation dataset with well-annotated emotional and style labels. This indicates that the dataset is significant and likely detailed in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges in generating realistic co-speech facial animations and mention the creation of the **Media2Face Dataset (M2F-D)**. They highlight that this dataset is essential for training their proposed model, which suggests it will be described in detail later in the paper.

In the **methods section**, particularly in the subsection discussing the dataset, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the **M2F-D dataset**. They mention that it has a total duration of over 60 hours and includes various emotional and style annotations. They also describe how the dataset was created by extracting facial expressions and head poses from existing datasets, which is crucial for understanding its composition.

The authors reference several datasets used to augment the M2F-D dataset, including:

1. **MEAD**: A large-scale audio-visual dataset for emotional talking-face generation.
2. **CREMA-D**: A dataset comprising 7,442 distinct clips featuring 91 actors expressing different emotions.
3. **RAVDESS**: A dataset consisting of videos by 24 professional actors vocalizing speeches and songs.
4. **HDTF**: A collection of high-quality videos.
5. **Acappella**: A dataset of solo singing videos.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MEAD**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited, ready for structured output or further processing.
