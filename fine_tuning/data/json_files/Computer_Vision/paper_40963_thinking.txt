To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Region-wise Generative Adversarial Image Inpainting for Large Missing Areas" by Yuqing Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on three widely-used datasets for image inpainting tasks. This indicates that datasets are indeed present, and I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly list the datasets in **section 4.1 (Datasets)**. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **CelebA-HQ**: This dataset contains 30,000 high-resolution face images. The authors specify that they adopted the same partition as a previous study.

2. **Places2**: This dataset includes 8,097,967 training images with diverse scenes, which is significant for evaluating the inpainting method.

3. **Paris StreetView**: This dataset consists of 14,900 training images and 100 test images, providing a varied set of urban scene images.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **CelebA-HQ**:
  > T. Karras, T. Aila, S. Laine, and J. Lehtinen. *Progressive growing of gans for improved quality, stability, and variation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.10196, 2017.

- **Places2**:
  > B. Zhou, A. Lapedriza, A. Khosla, A. Oliva, and A. Torralba. *Places: A 10 million image database for scene recognition*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 40, no. 6, pp. 1452â€“1464, 2018.

- **Paris StreetView**:
  > C. Doersch, S. Singh, A. Gupta, J. Sivic, and A. Efros. *What makes Paris look like Paris?* ACM Transactions on Graphics, vol. 31, no. 4, 2012.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes the dataset names, descriptions, and their full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
