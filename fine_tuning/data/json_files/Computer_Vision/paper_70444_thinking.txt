To extract datasets from the research paper titled "S2IP-LLM: Semantic Space Informed Prompt Learning with LLM for Time Series Forecasting" by Zijie Pan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted empirical studies on multiple benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention that they evaluated their method on **11 public datasets** for various forecasting tasks. I will look for a subsection that lists these datasets explicitly.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors provide detailed information about the datasets in **Appendix A.3**. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **ETTm1**: A dataset for long-term forecasting, consisting of time series data sampled every 15 minutes, containing 7 variables.
2. **ETTm2**: Similar to ETTm1, this dataset also contains 7 variables and is sampled every 15 minutes.
3. **ETTh1**: Another dataset for long-term forecasting, with 7 variables sampled hourly.
4. **ETTh2**: Similar to ETTh1, this dataset also contains 7 variables and is sampled hourly.
5. **Electricity**: This dataset includes records of electricity consumption from 321 customers, sampled hourly.
6. **Traffic**: Contains occupancy rates of the freeway system from 862 sensors in California, sampled hourly.
7. **Weather**: A dataset with one-year records from 21 meteorological stations in Germany, sampled every 10 minutes.
8. **M4-Yearly**: Part of the M4 benchmark dataset, containing various time series sampled yearly.
9. **M4-Quarterly**: Another part of the M4 benchmark dataset, sampled quarterly.
10. **M4-Monthly**: Part of the M4 benchmark dataset, sampled monthly.
11. **M4-Weekly**: Part of the M4 benchmark dataset, sampled weekly.
12. **M4-Daily**: Part of the M4 benchmark dataset, sampled daily.
13. **M4-Hourly**: Part of the M4 benchmark dataset, sampled hourly.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the following relevant works:

- For the **ETT datasets**, the citation is:
  > Zhou, H., Zhang, S., Peng, J., Zhang, S., Li, J., Xiong, H., and Zhang, W. *Informer: Beyond efficient transformer for long sequence time-series forecasting*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, volume 35, pp. 11106–11115, 2021.

- For the **M4 benchmark dataset**, the citation is:
  > Makridakis, S., Spiliotis, E., and Assimakopoulos, V. *The M4 competition: Results, findings, conclusion and way forward*. International Journal of Forecasting, 34(4):802–808, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be documented with its name, description, and full citation.
