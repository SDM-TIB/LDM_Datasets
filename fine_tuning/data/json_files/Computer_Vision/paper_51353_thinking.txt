To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational autoencoders in the presence of low-dimensional data: landscape and implicit bias" by Frederic Koehler et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets, while the methodology section typically details how the datasets were utilized in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of training Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with data supported on low-dimensional manifolds. They mention that they will consider synthetic datasets generated by a "ground truth" generator. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe the data generation process in **section 2 (Setup)**, where they explain how they generate synthetic datasets. They mention that the data is produced by sampling from a Gaussian distribution and applying a function to create the desired low-dimensional manifold. However, they do not provide specific dataset names, as the datasets are synthetic.

Since the paper does not reference any publicly available datasets, I will note that the datasets used are synthetic and generated based on the described methodology. I will also check the **References section** to see if any foundational works or datasets are cited that could be relevant.

In this case, the authors do not provide full citations for any datasets since they are synthetic. However, I will summarize the dataset generation process as follows:

1. **Synthetic Dataset for Linear Case**: Generated by sampling from a Gaussian distribution and applying a linear transformation.
2. **Synthetic Dataset for Nonlinear Case**: Generated by sampling from a Gaussian distribution and applying a nonlinear function.

Since there are no specific datasets with citations, I will note that the datasets are synthetic and generated based on the methods described in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring to highlight that the datasets are synthetic and generated according to the methods outlined in the paper.
