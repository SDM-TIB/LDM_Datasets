To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data Efficient Masked Language Modeling for Vision and Language" by Yonatan Bitton et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors investigate alternative masking strategies for masked language modeling (MLM) in vision-language tasks, which suggests that they may reference specific datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** to identify any datasets explicitly mentioned. In the introduction, the authors refer to several pre-training datasets commonly used in vision-language models, including **Conceptual Captions**, **SBU Captions**, and the **LXMERT pre-train dataset**, which is a combination of several datasets like **COCO**, **Visual Genome**, **VQA**, **VG-QA**, and **GQA**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their research.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors discuss their experiments with the LXMERT model and mention that they utilize the **GQA**, **VQA**, and **NLVR2** datasets for evaluation. This is a strong indication that these datasets are integral to their research findings.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries along with their full citations to ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately for future reference or processing.
