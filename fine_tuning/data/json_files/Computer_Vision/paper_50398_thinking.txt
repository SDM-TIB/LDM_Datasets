To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WHY PROPAGATE ALONE? PARALLEL USE OF LABELS AND FEATURES ON GRAPHS" by Yangkun Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for any references to datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using **four datasets** for their experiments: **Cora-full**, **Pubmed**, **ogbn-arxiv**, and **ogbn-products**. I will note down the details provided for each dataset, including any specific characteristics or configurations mentioned in the paper.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial as it allows for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets if needed.

1. **Cora-full**: The dataset is referenced in the context of node classification tasks. The citation is:
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-106.

2. **Pubmed**: This dataset is also used for node classification tasks. The citation is the same as above:
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-106.

3. **ogbn-arxiv**: This dataset is part of the Open Graph Benchmark. The citation is:
   > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.00687*.

4. **ogbn-products**: This dataset is also part of the Open Graph Benchmark. The citation is the same as above:
   > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.00687*.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further research or validation of the findings presented by the authors.
