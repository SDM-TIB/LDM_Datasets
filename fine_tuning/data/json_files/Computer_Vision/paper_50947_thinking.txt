To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DLVGen: A Dual Latent Variable Approach to Personalized Dialogue Generation" by Jing Yang Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a dialogue corpus for experiments, which suggests that there may be a specific dataset involved. The introduction further elaborates on the challenges of personalized dialogue generation and hints at the use of existing datasets for training and evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors specifically mention using the **ConvAI2 dialogue corpus** for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its structure and purpose.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the ConvAI2 corpus in detail, stating that it contains 17,878 dialogues from 1,155 unique personas for training and 1,000 dialogues from 100 unique personas for testing. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ConvAI2 dataset. The citation for the ConvAI2 corpus is as follows:
> Dinan, E., Logacheva, V., Malykh, V., Miller, A., Shuster, K., Urbanek, J., Kiela, D., Szlam, A., Serban, I., Lowe, R., Prabhumoye, S., Black, A. W., Rudnicky, A., Williams, J., Pineau, J., Burtsev, M., and Weston, J. (2019). The second conversational intelligence challenge (convai2).

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
