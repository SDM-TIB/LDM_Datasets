To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analytical bounds on the local Lipschitz constants of ReLU networks" by Trevor Avant and Kristi A. Morgansen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methodology sections, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup and the datasets used.

Next, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. These sections often contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and testing the models. I will pay attention to any dataset names, descriptions, and the context in which they are used.

If the authors refer to well-known datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided in the paper. If they introduce new datasets, I will carefully document their characteristics, such as the number of samples, types of data, and any specific features that are highlighted.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper for full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the complete citation format, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, I would look for the citation:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: A Benchmark in Image Classification*. 2009.

If they refer to a dataset they created, I will format the citation according to the details provided in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured and can be used for further analysis or replication of the study.
