To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-supervised Stacked Label Consistent Autoencoder for Reconstruction and Analysis of Biomedical Signals" by Anupriya Gogna et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on ECG and EEG signals, which suggests that specific datasets may be referenced.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of tele-monitoring and the need for efficient signal acquisition and analysis. However, they do not mention specific datasets here.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section**. In **subsection IV.A**, the authors explicitly mention using the **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset** for ECG classification and reconstruction. They provide a detailed description of this dataset, including its origin, the number of recordings, and the annotation process. This is a clear indication that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

In **subsection IV.B**, the authors mention using the **University of Bonn EEG dataset** for EEG classification and reconstruction. They describe the dataset's structure, including the number of segments and the conditions under which they were recorded. This dataset is also essential for their experiments.

The citation for the **University of Bonn EEG dataset** is:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as specified. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
