To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-supervised Semantics-guided Adversarial Training for Robust Trajectory Prediction" by Ruochen Jiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments with different types of attacks and that they evaluated their method using specific datasets. This indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention using three datasets for their experiments: **Argoverse 1**, **Argoverse 2**, and **ApolloScape**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the datasets as follows:
1. **Argoverse 1**: Contains 3D tracking and forecasting data with rich maps and multiple agents’ trajectories sampled at a frequency of 10Hz.
2. **Argoverse 2**: Similar to Argoverse 1, it includes more than 250k real driving scenarios in different cities.
3. **ApolloScape**: A simpler dataset without maps, containing 6 waypoints for both history and future trajectories.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The citations I find are:

- For **Argoverse 1**:
  > Ming-Fang Chang, John Lambert, Patsorn Sangkloy, Jagjeet Singh, Slawomir Bak, Andrew Hartnett, De Wang, Peter Carr, Simon Lucey, Deva Ramanan, et al. *Argoverse: 3D Tracking and Forecasting with Rich Maps*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 8748–8757, 2019.

- For **Argoverse 2**:
  > Benjamin Wilson, William Qi, Tanmay Agarwal, John Lambert, Jagjeet Singh, Siddhesh Khandelwal, Bowen Pan, Ratnesh Kumar, Jhony Kaesemodel Pontes, et al. *Argoverse 2: Next Generation Datasets for Self-Driving Perception and Forecasting*. In Thirty-fifth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track (Round 2), 2021.

- For **ApolloScape**:
  > Takami Sato, Junjie Shen, Ningfei Wang, Yunhan Jia, Xue Lin, and Qi Alfred Chen. *The ApolloScape Dataset for Autonomous Driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, pages 954–960, 2018.

With these citations, I now have all the necessary information to create structured entries for each dataset. I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is properly documented for future reference.
