To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures are associated with widespread network abnormality in temporal lobe epilepsy" by Nishant Sinha et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may include references to datasets used for analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, as it typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets, including participant demographics, data collection methods, and any specific datasets used for analysis. In this paper, the authors mention studying a cohort of **83 drug-resistant patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE)** and **29 healthy controls**. This indicates that the dataset includes clinical data from these participants.

I will also look for any specific tables or figures that summarize the data. For instance, **Table 1** provides demographic and clinical data of patients, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's composition. It includes information on the number of patients, their sex, age at MRI, age at epilepsy onset, duration of epilepsy, history of focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (FBTCS), and surgical outcomes.

Additionally, I will check the **results section** for any references to specific datasets used for statistical analysis or comparisons. The authors discuss the findings related to the structural network alterations in TLE patients with and without FBTCS, which may imply the use of specific datasets for these analyses.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or studies referenced in the paper. This is important for providing proper attribution and context for the datasets used.

For this paper, the datasets can be summarized as follows:

1. **Cohort of Patients with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE)**: This dataset includes clinical data from 83 drug-resistant patients with TLE, categorized into those with and without FBTCS, and 29 healthy controls. The data includes demographic information and clinical characteristics.

2. **MRI Data**: The study utilized diffusion-weighted MRI data to construct whole-brain structural networks, which is a critical aspect of the analysis.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the cohort of patients:
  > Sinha, N., Peternell, N., Schroeder, G. M., de Tisi, J., Vos, S. B., Winston, G. P., Duncan, J. S., Wang, Y., & Taylor, P. N. (2023). Focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures are associated with widespread network abnormality in temporal lobe epilepsy. *Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry*, 94(1), 12-20. doi:10.1136/jnnp-2023-329999.

- For the MRI data methodology:
  > Sinha, N., Wang, Y., Dauwels, J., Kaiser, M., Thesen, T., Forsyth, R., & Taylor, P. N. (2019). Node abnormality predicts seizure outcome and relates to long-term relapse after epilepsy surgery. *Biorxiv*, 747725. doi:10.1101/747725.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
