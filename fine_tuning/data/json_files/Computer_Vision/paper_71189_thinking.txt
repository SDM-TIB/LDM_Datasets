To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GSDF: 3DGS Meets SDF for Improved Rendering and Reconstruction" by Mulin Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted evaluations on rendering and reconstruction quality using datasets from various sources. This indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention that they conducted experiments on **11 real-world scenes from publicly available datasets**. They specify the following datasets:

1. **Mip-NeRF360**: This dataset is referenced as containing scenes used for evaluating rendering quality. It is mentioned multiple times throughout the paper, indicating its significance in the experiments.

2. **Deep Blending**: Another dataset used in the experiments, which is also referenced in the context of rendering quality assessments.

3. **Tanks & Temples**: This dataset is noted for its use in evaluating reconstruction quality. It is a well-known benchmark in the field of 3D reconstruction.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For **Mip-NeRF360**, the citation is:
  > Barron, J.T., Mildenhall, B., Verbin, D., Srinivasan, P.P., Hedman, P. "Mip-NeRF 360: Unbounded Anti-Aliased Neural Radiance Fields." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 5470–5479, 2022.

- For **Deep Blending**, the citation is:
  > Hedman, P., Philip, J., Price, T., Frahm, J.M., Drettakis, G., Brostow, G. "Deep Blending for Free-Viewpoint Image-Based Rendering." ACM Transactions on Graphics, 37(6), 257:1–257:15, 2018.

- For **Tanks & Temples**, the citation is:
  > Knapitsch, A., Park, J., Zhou, Q.Y., Koltun, V. "Tanks and Temples: Benchmarking Large-Scale Scene Reconstruction." ACM Transactions on Graphics, 36(4), 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
