To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Functional connectivity patterns of autism spectrum disorder identified by deep feature learning" by Hongyoon Choi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study used resting-state fMRI data from 972 subjects, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsection labeled **A. Materials**. Here, the author explicitly states that the data was acquired from the **Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE)** repository. This is a crucial piece of information as it identifies the source of the dataset.

In this section, the author mentions that the dataset includes fMRI scans of 972 subjects, comprising 465 ASD patients and 507 normal controls. This detail is important for describing the dataset's composition.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ABIDE dataset. The relevant reference is:

- Di Martino, A., Kelly, C., Grzadzinski, R., Zuo, X. N., Mennes, M., Mairena, M. A., Lord, C., Castellanos, F. X., & Milham, M. P. (2014). The autism brain imaging data exchange: towards a large-scale evaluation of the intrinsic brain architecture in autism. *Molecular Psychiatry*, 19(6), 659-67.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the information:

1. **Dataset Name**: Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE)
   - **Description**: This dataset includes resting-state fMRI scans of 972 subjects, consisting of 465 individuals diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and 507 normal controls. The data is publicly available and was collected from multiple sites.
   - **Full Citation**: Di Martino, A., Kelly, C., Grzadzinski, R., Zuo, X. N., Mennes, M., Mairena, M. A., Lord, C., Castellanos, F. X., & Milham, M. P. (2014). The autism brain imaging data exchange: towards a large-scale evaluation of the intrinsic brain architecture in autism. *Molecular Psychiatry*, 19(6), 659-67.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
