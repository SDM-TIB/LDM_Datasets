To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Echo from noise: synthetic ultrasound image generation using diffusion models for real image segmentation" by David Stojanovski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors generated synthetic ultrasound images and trained a neural network for segmentation tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of obtaining high-quality echocardiographic images and the potential of using synthetic data. They mention the **CAMUS echocardiography dataset** as a source for training and validating their models, which is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.1 (Synthetic ultrasound generation)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the **CAMUS dataset**. They specify that it contains 500 patients with semantically segmented images, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose. They also mention how they split the dataset into training and validation subsets.

Additionally, in **section 2.2 (Segmentation)**, the authors describe the creation of four synthetic datasets derived from the CAMUS dataset, specifically **2CED, 2CES, 4CED, and 4CES**. They explain how these datasets were generated using semantic maps and transformations, which is important for documenting the datasets' characteristics.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citation for the **CAMUS dataset** is as follows:
- **CAMUS Dataset**:

"Deep learning for segmentation using an open large-scale dataset in 2D echocardiography." *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 38(9), 2198–2210, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2019.2891980

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
