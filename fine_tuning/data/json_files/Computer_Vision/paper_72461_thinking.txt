To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Anomaly Detection via Masked Diffusion Posterior Sampling" by Di Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that "exhaustive experiments on MVTec and BTAD datasets demonstrate that MDPS can achieve state-of-the-art performance." This indicates that these two datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **MVTec Dataset**: This dataset is an industrial anomaly detection benchmark that contains 15 categories, with around 200 normal samples and 100 anomaly samples for each class. It provides various types of anomalies with pixel-level segmentation ground truths.

2. **BTAD Dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately 2500 real-world industrial images of three products, posing a challenge for anomaly detection due to the location of some anomalies in the edge regions of the images.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MVTec Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Paul Bergmann, Kilian Batzner, Michael Fauser, David Sattlegger, and Carsten Steger. *The MVTec anomaly detection dataset: a comprehensive real-world dataset for unsupervised anomaly detection*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 129(4):1038–1059, 2021.

- For the **BTAD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pankaj Mishra, Riccardo Verk, Daniele Fornasier, Claudio Piciarelli, and Gian Luca Foresti. *VT-ADL: A vision transformer network for image anomaly detection and localization*. In International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE), pages 01–06. IEEE, 2021.

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately represented the details as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
