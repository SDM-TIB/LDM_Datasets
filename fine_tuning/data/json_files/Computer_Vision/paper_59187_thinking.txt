To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robustness Evaluation in Hand Pose Estimation Models using Metamorphic Testing" by Muxin Pu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for hand pose estimation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges in hand pose estimation and the need for robust models. They mention the lack of large annotated datasets for hand poses, which suggests that they may refer to specific datasets later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly where the authors describe their experimental setup. In this section, they mention using two public hand pose datasets: **FreiHand** and **CMU Panoptic Hand**. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets, such as their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors elaborate on how they selected images from these datasets for testing purposes. They specify that they used 2500 sample images containing hands with objects and 3000 sample images containing hands without objects from each dataset. This information is crucial for understanding the context in which the datasets were used.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations I need to extract are:

1. For **FreiHand**:
   > C. Zimmermann et al. "FreiHAND: A Dataset for Markerless Capture of Hand Pose and Shape From Single RGB Images". In: 2019 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 813–822, 2019. DOI: 10.1109/ICCV.2019.00090.

2. For **CMU Panoptic Hand**:
   > Yifei Chen et al. "Nonparametric structure regularization machine for 2D hand pose estimation". In: Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision, pages 381–390, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, which is essential for any further analysis or replication of the research.
