To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning with Label Embedding Reward for Supervised Image Hashing" by Zhenzhen Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on the **CIFAR-10** and **NUS-WIDE** datasets, indicating that these are the datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors provide details about the datasets. In this section, they describe:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset contains 60,000 color images across 10 classes, with each class having 6,000 images of size 32x32 pixels. This dataset is widely used for image classification tasks.

2. **NUS-WIDE**: This is a multi-label image dataset comprising 269,648 color images annotated with 5,018 unique tags. The authors mention using a subset of 195,834 images associated with the 21 most frequent concepts, each containing at least 5,000 images.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **NUS-WIDE**, the citation is:
  > Tat-Seng Chua, Jinhui Tang, Richang Hong, Haojie Li, Zhiping Luo, and Yantao Zheng. *NUS-WIDE: A real-world web image database from National University of Singapore*. In CIVR. ACM, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research along with their proper citations.
