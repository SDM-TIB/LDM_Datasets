To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LEDITS++: Limitless Image Editing using Text-to-Image Models" by Manuel Brack et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the introduction of a novel benchmark called **TEdBench++**, which suggests that this is a dataset relevant to the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. In this case, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will also check the **background section** for any references to existing datasets that may have been utilized in their experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors introduce **TEdBench++** as a new benchmark for evaluating textual image manipulation. They mention that it contains 120 entries, which include original images paired with textual edit instructions. This indicates that TEdBench++ is a dataset specifically designed for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for TEdBench++. The authors state that TEdBench++ is publicly available, which is important for reproducibility and further research.

The citation for **TEdBench++** is:
> Brack, M., Friedrich, F., Hintersdorf, D., Struppek, L., Schramowski, P., & Kersting, K. (2024). TEdBench++: A revised benchmark for textual image editing. *Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper, such as the **CelebA dataset**, which is referenced in the context of evaluating multi-conditioned attribute manipulation. The citation for CelebA is:
> Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). Deep learning face attributes in the wild. *Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, facilitating further exploration and understanding of the methodologies employed.
