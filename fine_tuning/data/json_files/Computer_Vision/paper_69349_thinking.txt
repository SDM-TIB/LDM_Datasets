To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Blue noise for diffusion models" by Xingchang Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their evaluations. In this section, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about their use in the experiments.

In the **experiments subsection (4.1)**, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used for their evaluations:

1. **CelebA**: This dataset is referenced as being used for unconditional image generation. I will note its significance in the context of the experiments.

2. **AFHQ-Cat**: Another dataset mentioned for image generation tasks, specifically for unconditional and conditional image generation.

3. **LSUN-Bedroom**: This dataset is also used for image generation tasks, and I will ensure to capture its details as well.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **CelebA**:
  > Lee, C. H., Liu, Z., Wu, L., & Luo, P. (2020). MaskGAN: Towards Diverse and Interactive Facial Image Manipulation. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- **AFHQ-Cat**:
  > Choi, Y., Uh, Y., Yoo, J., & Ha, J. W. (2020). Stargan v2: Diverse image synthesis for multiple domains. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (CVPR), 8188â€“8197.

- **LSUN-Bedroom**:
  > Yu, F., Zhang, Y., Song, S., Seff, A., & Xiao, J. (2015). LSUN: Construction of a Large-scale Image Dataset using Deep Learning with Humans in the Loop. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.03365.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
