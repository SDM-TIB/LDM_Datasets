To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpreting Deep Learning-Based Networking Systems" by Zili Meng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a high-level overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used in the study. In the abstract, the authors discuss evaluating their framework, Metis, over various DL-based networking systems, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments** within the paper. This is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. In this paper, I will specifically check sections that detail the experiments conducted with Metis, as they are likely to include information about the datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention three specific DL-based networking systems: **Pensieve**, **AuTO**, and **RouteNet**. I will need to identify the datasets associated with these systems. 

1. **Pensieve**: The authors mention using real-world network traces, specifically referencing **250 HSDPA traces** and **205 FCC traces**. I will need to find the full citations for these datasets in the references section.

2. **AuTO**: The paper mentions using **web search (WS) traces** and **data mining (DM) traces** for evaluation. Again, I will look for the full citations for these datasets.

3. **RouteNet**: The authors refer to using the **traffic dataset of the NSFNet topology**. I will also need to find the citation for this dataset.

Next, I will consult the **References section** of the paper to gather the full citations for each of the datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

After compiling the citations, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- For **Pensieve**:
  - **HSDPA Traces**: Citation needed.
  - **FCC Traces**: Citation needed.

- For **AuTO**:
  - **Web Search Traces**: Citation needed.
  - **Data Mining Traces**: Citation needed.

- For **RouteNet**:
  - **NSFNet Traffic Dataset**: Citation needed.

Finally, I will ensure that I format the dataset descriptions clearly, including the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ready for any required output format or further processing. This structured approach will help in accurately extracting and documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
