To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DE-Net: Dynamic Text-guided Image Editing Adversarial Networks" by Ming Tao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. In the introduction, the authors discuss the performance of their model on various public datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely to be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **CUB bird dataset**: This dataset consists of 11,788 images belonging to 200 bird species, with each image corresponding to ten language descriptions.

2. **COCO dataset**: This dataset contains 80,000 images for training and 40,000 images for testing, with each image associated with five language descriptions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **CUB bird dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. Wah, S. Branson, P. Welinder, P. Perona, and S. Belongie. *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*. Technical Report CNS-TR-2011-001, California Institute of Technology, 2011.

- For the **COCO dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European conference on computer vision, pages 740–755. Springer, 2014.

Now that I have the dataset names and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
