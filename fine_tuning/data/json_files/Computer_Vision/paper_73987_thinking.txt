To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BitsFusion: 1.99 bits Weight Quantization of Diffusion Model" by Yang Sui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors mention that they evaluate their quantized model across various benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The introduction discusses the challenges of quantizing large-scale diffusion models and hints at the need for extensive evaluation across benchmark datasets. However, it does not specify the names of these datasets.

I will then examine the **experiments section** in detail, particularly focusing on any subsections that discuss the evaluation metrics and datasets used. Here, the authors mention several benchmark datasets, including **MS-COCO 2014**, **TIFA**, and **GenEval**. Each of these datasets is used to evaluate the performance of the quantized model.

To ensure I have the correct details, I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers who may want to access these datasets.

1. **MS-COCO 2014**: This dataset is widely used for image captioning and object detection tasks. The citation is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V 13, pages 740–755. Springer, 2014.

2. **TIFA**: This dataset is used for evaluating text-to-image faithfulness. The citation is:
   > Yushi Hu, Benlin Liu, Jungo Kasai, Yizhong Wang, Mari Ostendorf, Ranjay Krishna, and Noah A Smith. *TIFA: Accurate and Interpretable Text-to-Image Faithfulness Evaluation with Question Answering*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 20406–20417, 2023.

3. **GenEval**: This dataset is used for evaluating the consistency between generated images and their descriptions. The citation is:
   > Dhruba Ghosh, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, and Ludwig Schmidt. *GenEval: An Object-Focused Framework for Evaluating Text-to-Image Alignment*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 36, 2024.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further studies in the field.
