To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FloorNet: A Unified Framework for Floorplan Reconstruction from 3D Scans" by Chen Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors have created a benchmark for floorplan reconstruction using RGBD video streams from 155 residential houses or apartments. This suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Floorplan reconstruction benchmark)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that they acquired RGBD video streams for 155 residential units using Google Tango phones and annotated complete floorplan information. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including the number of scans and the types of annotations.

The authors specify that the dataset includes:
- Room corners as points
- Walls as pairs of room corners
- Object icons and types as axis-aligned rectangles and classification labels
- Doors and windows as line segments on walls
- Room types as classification labels for polygonal areas enclosed by walls

The statistics provided in **Table 1** further detail the dataset, including the average number of rooms, icons, openings, corners, and total area.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for their dataset, as it is a new benchmark created by them. However, I will note that the dataset is based on RGBD video streams collected using Google Tango phones.

Since the dataset is original and created by the authors, I will format the citation as follows:
> Liu, C., Wu, J., & Furukawa, Y. (2023). *FloorNet: A Unified Framework for Floorplan Reconstruction from 3D Scans*. [Dataset]. Available at: https://github.com/art-programmer/FloorNet.

In summary, I have identified the dataset created by the authors, described its contents, and noted that it is a new benchmark for floorplan reconstruction. I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.
