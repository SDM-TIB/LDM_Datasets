To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model Selection of Anomaly Detectors in the Absence of Labeled Validation Data" by Clement Fung et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed framework, SWSA, on various anomaly detection tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Empirical Study)**, as it explicitly mentions the datasets used for the experiments. In this section, the authors describe four datasets:

1. **Caltech-UCSD Birds (CUB)**: This dataset contains images of 200 bird species and is referenced as a benchmark for anomaly detection tasks.
   
2. **Oxford Flowers**: This dataset includes images of 102 flower species and is similarly used for evaluating the proposed methods.

3. **MVTec Anomaly Detection (MVTec-AD)**: This dataset consists of images from 15 real industrial product categories, with both defect-free and defective images included.

4. **Visual Anomaly Detection (VisA)**: This dataset contains images from 12 industrial product categories, also featuring both good and defective products.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about how these datasets are utilized in their evaluation framework, confirming their relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **Caltech-UCSD Birds (CUB)**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*. Technical Report CNS-TR-2011-001, California Institute of Technology.

- For **Oxford Flowers**, the citation is:
  > Nilsback, M.-E., & Zisserman, A. (2008). *Automated flower classification over a large number of classes*. In Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics and Image Processing.

- For **MVTec Anomaly Detection (MVTec-AD)**, the citation is:
  > Bergmann, P., Fauser, M., Sattlegger, D., & Steger, C. (2019). *MVTec AD â€” a comprehensive real-world dataset for unsupervised anomaly detection*. In IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.

- For **Visual Anomaly Detection (VisA)**, the citation is:
  > Zou, Y., Jeong, J., Pemula, L., Zhang, D., & Dabeer, O. (2022). *Spot-the-difference self-supervised pre-training for anomaly detection and segmentation*. In European Conference on Computer Vision.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the study.
