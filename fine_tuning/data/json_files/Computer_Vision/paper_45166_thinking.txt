To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "MegDetV2" by Zeming Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved results on the **COCO-2019 detection/instance-segmentation test-dev dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is significant for their work.

Next, I will examine **section 2.1 (Training & Inference)**, where the authors mention validating their system on the **COCO-2017 datasets**, which contain 135K images for training and 5K images for validation. This is another dataset that I need to document.

In the same section, they also refer to the **Objects365 detection datasets**, which includes 365 object categories and 600K training/30K validation images. This dataset is crucial for understanding the pre-training process they used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **COCO dataset**, the citation is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Piotr Dollar, Ross B Girshick, Kaiming He, Bharath Hariharan, and Serge J Belongie. *Feature Pyramid Networks for Object Detection*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 936–944, 2017.

2. For the **Objects365 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Shuai Shao, Zeming Li, Tianyuan Zhang, Chao Peng, Gang Yu, Jing Li, Xiangyu Zhang, and Jian Sun. *Objects365: A Large-Scale, High-Quality Dataset for Object Detection*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 843–852, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
