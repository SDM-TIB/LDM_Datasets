To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LuoJiaHOG: A Hierarchy Oriented Geo-aware Image Caption Dataset for Remote Sensing Image-Text Retrieval" by Yuanxin Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the **LuojiaHOG dataset**, which is the primary focus of the paper. It highlights that this dataset is designed for image-text retrieval in remote sensing applications.

Next, I will look for specific details about the **LuojiaHOG dataset** in the **methods section**. Here, the authors provide a comprehensive description of the dataset, including its construction, characteristics, and statistics. They mention that LuojiaHOG consists of **94,856 images** with **724,000+ sentences** for remote sensing scenes, categorized into **21 second-level and 131 third-level labels**.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their proposed method on the LuojiaHOG dataset, confirming its significance in advancing image-text retrieval tasks.

Now, I will check the **references section** for the full citation of the LuojiaHOG dataset. However, since this dataset is introduced in the paper itself, it may not have a separate citation. Instead, I will use the paper's citation as the authoritative reference for the dataset.

The citation for the paper is:
> Yuanxin Zhao, Mi Zhang, Bingnan Yang, Zhan Zhang, Jiaju Kang, Jianya Gong. *LuoJiaHOG: A Hierarchy Oriented Geo-aware Image Caption Dataset for Remote Sensing Image-Text Retrieval*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2023.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the LuojiaHOG dataset as it is the primary dataset discussed in the paper. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset for future reference or analysis.
