To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Nonparametric Identification and Estimation of Earnings Dynamics using a Hidden Markov Model: Evidence from the PSID" by Tong Zhou, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their model to the **Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)** dataset, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of the PSID in the **introduction** and **materials and methods** sections. In the introduction, the authors discuss the importance of earnings dynamics and mention the PSID as their primary data source. In the **materials and methods** section, they elaborate on the PSID dataset, describing it as the longest-running household panel survey in the world, containing a wide range of variables related to income, employment, education, and more.

In the **results section**, the authors present empirical findings based on the PSID dataset, which further confirms its significance in their research. They also mention challenges related to the dataset, such as data quality and longitudinal analysis, which indicates a thorough engagement with the dataset.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the PSID dataset. The authors acknowledge the University of Michigan for providing the PSID data, but they do not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself. However, I can reference the PSID as follows:

- **Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)**: 
  > University of Michigan. *Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)*. Available at: https://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/

Since the PSID is a well-known dataset, this citation is appropriate for academic purposes.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for the PSID, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will be ready for downstream processing or review.
