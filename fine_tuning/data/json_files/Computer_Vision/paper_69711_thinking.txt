To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Microstructures and Accuracy of Graph Recall by Large Language Models" by Yanbang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on graph recall by LLMs, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction, however, discusses the importance of graph-structured information and hints at the use of datasets for experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 3.1 (Experimental Protocols and Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention five datasets from different application domains:

1. **Co-authorship: DBLP (1995-2005)** - This dataset is used for studying co-authorship relationships in academic publications.
2. **Social network: Facebook** - This dataset captures social interactions within the Facebook platform.
3. **Geological network: CA road** - This dataset represents the road network in California.
4. **Protein interactions: Reactome** - This dataset includes biological interactions among proteins.
5. **Erdős–Rényi graph** - This dataset is generated based on a random graph model.

The authors also mention that each dataset comprises 100 graphs and their paired textual descriptions, which is crucial for understanding the context of the experiments.

Next, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **DBLP**, the citation is:
  > Tang, J., Zhang, J., Yao, L., Li, J., Zhang, L., & Su, Z. (2008). Arnetminer: extraction and mining of academic social networks. In Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (pp. 990–998).

- For **Facebook**, the citation is:

- For **CA road**, the citation is:

- For **Reactome**, the citation is:

- For the **Erdős–Rényi graph**, the citation is:
  > Fatemi, B., Halcrow, J., & Perozzi, B. (2023). Talk like a graph: Encoding graphs for large language models. arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.04560.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
