To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-Grained Dynamic Head for Object Detection" by Lin Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method on several state-of-the-art detection benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention conducting extensive experiments on the **COCO dataset**. This is a significant dataset in the field of object detection, and I need to gather more details about it.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the COCO dataset. The citation for the COCO dataset is as follows:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr DollÃ¡r, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, 2014.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to the **ImageNet dataset** in the implementation details, which is commonly used for pre-training models. I will also find the citation for this dataset:
> Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009.

Now, I have identified two datasets used in the paper: **COCO** and **ImageNet**. I will compile the information about these datasets, including their descriptions and full citations.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that all necessary details are accurately captured for future reference or processing.
