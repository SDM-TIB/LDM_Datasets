To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RS-Corrector: Correcting the Racial Stereotypes in Latent Diffusion Models" by Yue Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a "high-quality dataset on various racial groups," which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors describe their dataset construction process. They mention filtering and re-annotating facial images from **LAION-5B**, which is a significant dataset used in their research.

In this section, the authors detail that they created a dataset encompassing various racial groups, specifically mentioning **White, Black, Asian, Latin, and Indian** groups. Each group is described as being equally distributed in terms of gender and age to eliminate biases.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the **LAION-5B dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Christoph Schuhmann, Romain Beaumont, Richard Vencu, Cade Gordon, Ross Wightman, Mehdi Cherti, Theo Coombes, Aarush Katta, Clayton Mullis, Mitchell Wortsman, et al. *LAION-5B: An open large-scale dataset for training next generation image-text models*. NIPS, 35:25278â€“25294, 2022.

Additionally, I will note that the authors mention using a face detection model called **libface** to filter images from LAION-5B, but this is not a dataset in itself, so I will not include it in the final dataset list.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for **LAION-5B** as it is the primary dataset referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring clarity and completeness in the information provided.
