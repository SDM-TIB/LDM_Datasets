To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Concentration bounds for linear Monge mapping estimation and optimal transport domain adaptation" by RÃ©mi Flamary and Karim Lounici, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses numerical experiments on simulated and real data, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention performing numerical experiments on simulated and real datasets. However, they do not explicitly name these datasets in the abstract or introduction.

I will then check the **experiments section** for any details about the datasets used. The authors mention using the MNIST dataset for convolutional mapping between images, which is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community. They also refer to simulated datasets for their experiments, but specific names or citations for these simulated datasets are not provided.

Since the MNIST dataset is explicitly mentioned, I will retrieve its full citation from the references section:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, 1998.

Next, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: A widely used dataset for handwritten digit recognition, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits.

Since the paper does not provide specific citations for the simulated datasets, I will not include them in the final output.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for review or downstream processing, ensuring that the full citation for the MNIST dataset is included.
