To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compositional 3D Scene Synthesis with Scene Graph Guided Layout-Shape Generation" by Yao Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions benchmarking on the **SG-FRONT dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely central to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they describe the **SG-FRONT dataset**, which is an extension of the original 3D-FRONT dataset. The authors specify that SG-FRONT includes 4,041 bedrooms, 900 dining rooms, and 813 living rooms, with a total of 45K object samples across 35 object categories and 15 relationship categories.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SG-FRONT dataset. The authors reference the original 3D-FRONT dataset, which is crucial for providing the complete context for SG-FRONT. The citation for the original dataset is:

- For **3D-FRONT dataset**:
  > Huan Fu, Bowen Cai, Lin Gao, Ling-Xiao Zhang, Jiaming Wang, Cao Li, Qixun Zeng, Chengyue Sun, Rongfei Jia, Binqiang Zhao, et al. *3D-FRONT: 3D Furnished Rooms with Layouts and Semantics*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 10933â€“10942, 2021.

The SG-FRONT dataset is mentioned as an extension of this dataset, so I will note that the citation for SG-FRONT is effectively the same as that of the 3D-FRONT dataset.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and citations in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the SG-FRONT dataset as it is critical for proper attribution.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a clear and concise output that can be used for further analysis or integration into a database.
