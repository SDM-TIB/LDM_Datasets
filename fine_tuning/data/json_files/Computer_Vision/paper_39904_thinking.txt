To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revisiting Flow Information for Traffic Prediction" by Xian Zhou, Yanyan Shen, and Linpeng Huang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they mention two datasets:

1. **TaxiNYC**: This dataset contains 267,953,551 taxi trip records in New York from January 1, 2014, to June 30, 2015. The authors specify that the city is divided into 20 regions, each approximately 1 km², and detail the training, validation, and test splits.

2. **TaxiCD**: This dataset consists of 7,065,937 taxicab records from Chengdu, China, collected in November 2016. The city is also divided into 20 regions, each 2 km², with specified time intervals for training, validation, and testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

For **TaxiNYC**, the citation is:
> NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission. *Taxi Trip Record Data*. Available at: http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml.

For **TaxiCD**, the citation is:
> Didi Chuxing. *TaxiCD Dataset*. Available at: https://gaia.didichuxing.com.

Now that I have the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation.

This methodical approach ensures that I accurately capture all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further analysis or replication of the study.
