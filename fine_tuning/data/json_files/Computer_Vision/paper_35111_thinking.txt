To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PatchFCN for Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection" by Weicheng Kuo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper focuses on detecting and segmenting acute intracranial hemorrhage using a dataset of CT scans, which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any specific mentions of datasets. The authors mention that they collected a dataset of 591 scans annotated by expert radiologists, which is a strong indication of a dataset being used.

In the **data collection section**, the authors provide detailed information about their dataset, including the number of scans (591), the time frame of data collection (2010 to 2017), and the types of CT scanners used. They also mention that the dataset includes various subtypes of acute intracranial hemorrhage, which adds context to the dataset's significance.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset. Since the authors state that they collected and annotated the dataset themselves, I will treat this as a primary dataset and create a citation based on the information provided in the paper. The citation will include the authors, title, and a brief description of the dataset.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset of 591 clinical head CT scans annotated pixelwise for the presence of hemorrhage by expert radiologists, collected over 7 years from 2010 to 2017.
- **Citation**: Weicheng Kuo, Christian HÃ¤ne, Esther Yuh, Pratik Mukherjee, and Jitendra Malik. *PatchFCN for Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets, I will only include this dataset in my final output.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes all the necessary details, ensuring that the citation is complete and accurate for future reference.
