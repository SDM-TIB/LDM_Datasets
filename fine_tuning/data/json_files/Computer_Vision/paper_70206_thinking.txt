To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Macroscopic Auxiliary Asymptotic Preserving Neural Networks for the Linear Radiative Transfer Equations" by Hongyan Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets, such as **"Numerical Experiments"** or **"Results"**. These sections typically contain information about the datasets used for validation or testing the proposed methods.

In the **Numerical Experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any references to datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. For example, if the authors mention using a specific dataset for their experiments, I will note down the details provided.

If the paper includes a **References section**, I will check for citations related to the datasets mentioned. This is crucial for obtaining the full citations needed for each dataset.

For instance, if the authors refer to a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset" or "JHMDB Dataset," I will ensure to find the original papers that describe these datasets and extract the full citations.

Once I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
