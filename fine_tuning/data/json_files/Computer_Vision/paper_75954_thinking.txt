To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A study of animal action segmentation algorithms across supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning paradigms," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to gather initial information about the datasets. The abstract mentions that the study uses **four datasets spanning multiple species** (fly, mouse, and human), which indicates that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will identify each dataset by name, along with relevant details such as the number of frames, behaviors categorized, and any specific characteristics mentioned.

The datasets identified in the paper are:

1. **Head-fixed fly dataset**: This dataset involves a head-fixed fly engaged in spontaneous behaviors on an air-supported ball. It contains 1.01 million frames, with behaviors labeled as still, walk, front groom, back groom, and abdomen move. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Schaffer, E. S., et al. (2023). "The spatial and temporal structure of neural activity across the fly brain." *Nature Communications*, 14(1), 5572.

2. **Freely moving mouse dataset**: This dataset includes a mouse freely moving around an open arena, with 280,000 frames and behaviors categorized as unsupported rearing, supported rearing, and grooming. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Sturman, O., et al. (2020). "Deep learning-based behavioral analysis reaches human accuracy and is capable of outperforming commercial solutions." *Neuropsychopharmacology*, 45(11), 1942-1952.

3. **Head-fixed mouse dataset**: This dataset comes from the International Brain Laboratory, where a head-fixed mouse performs a perceptual decision-making task. It contains 1 million frames with behaviors labeled as still, moving without turning the wheel, moving while turning the wheel, and grooming. The citation for this dataset is:
   > IBL et al. (2023). "A brain-wide map of neural activity during complex behaviour." *bioRxiv*, 2023-07.

4. **Human Gait Database (HuGaDB)**: This dataset consists of lower limb activities such as walking, running, and sitting, collected from 18 subjects using inertial measurement units (IMUs). It contains 517,000 frames, all of which are labeled. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Chereshnev, R., & Kert'esz-Farkas, A. (2017). "HuGaDB: Human Gait Database for Activity Recognition from Wearable Inertial Sensor Networks." *International Conference on Analysis of Images, Social Networks and Texts*, 131-141.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details, including the number of frames and behavior categories, as these are essential for understanding the datasets' contexts.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
