To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-Grained Cross-View Geo-Localization Using a Correlation-Aware Homography Estimator" by Xiaolong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of the **VIGOR benchmark** and the **KITTI benchmark**, indicating that these are datasets relevant to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **VIGOR Dataset**: This dataset contains geo-tagged ground-level panoramas and aerial images collected in four cities in the US. It includes 105,214 panoramas for geo-localization experiments. The authors mention that the dataset provides positive aerial images for training and testing.

2. **KITTI Dataset**: This dataset consists of ground-level images captured by a moving vehicle with a forward-facing viewpoint. It is noted that each aerial patch corresponds to a ground area of approximately 100m × 100m, and the dataset is used for evaluating the proposed method.

In the **References section**, I will look for the full citations of these datasets to ensure proper attribution:

- For the **VIGOR dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sijie Zhu, Taojiannan Yang, and Chen Chen. *VIGOR: Cross-view image geo-localization beyond one-to-one retrieval*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3640–3649, June 2021.

- For the **KITTI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, Christoph Stiller, and Raquel Urtasun. *Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, 32(11):1231–1237, 2013.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as presented in the research paper.
