To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EventNeRF: Neural Radiance Fields from a Single Colour Event Camera" by Viktor Rudnev et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on several synthetic and real scenes, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention that they examine **seven synthetic and ten real sequences**. I will look for any specific names or identifiers for these datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail the synthetic sequences they used, which are derived from the 3D models from Mildenhall et al. (2020). They also mention that for real data experiments, they recorded sequences using the DAVIS 346C colour event camera. This indicates that the datasets for real sequences are based on their own recordings.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The synthetic datasets are based on the work of Mildenhall et al., which I will cite accordingly. The real sequences are recorded by the authors themselves, so I will note that as well.

The citations I will include are:

1. For the synthetic datasets based on Mildenhall et al.:
   > Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P. Srinivasan, Matthew Tancik, Jonathan T. Barron, Ravi Ramamoorthi, and Ren Ng. *NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2020.

2. For the real sequences recorded using the DAVIS 346C camera, since they are original datasets created by the authors, I will note:
   > Viktor Rudnev, Mohamed Elgharib, Christian Theobalt, and Vladislav Golyanik. *EventNeRF: Neural Radiance Fields from a Single Colour Event Camera*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
