To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KRNet: Towards Efficient Knowledge Replay" by Yingying Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of KRNet in continual learning and mentions "extensive experiments" but does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using two datasets:

1. **CIFAR-100**: This dataset consists of 100 categories, with 500 images for training and 100 images for testing in each class. The authors provide details about the preprocessing steps, such as padding and cropping.

2. **ImageNet-Subset**: This dataset contains 100 classes sampled from the larger ImageNet dataset. The authors mention that there are approximately 1,300 training images and 50 test images per class, along with specific resizing and cropping techniques used during training and testing.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > A. Krizhevsky, “Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images,” Master’s Thesis, University of Toronto, 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > O. Russakovsky et al., “ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge,” International Journal of Computer Vision, vol. 115, no. 3, pp. 211–252, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
