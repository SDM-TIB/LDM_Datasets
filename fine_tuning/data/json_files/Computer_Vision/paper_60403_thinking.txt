To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DCELANM-Net: Medical Image Segmentation based on Dual Channel Efficient Layer Aggregation Network with Learner" by Chengzhun Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed model was tested on the **Kvasir-SEG** and **CVC-ClinicDB** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are significant for the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **Kvasir-SEG**: This dataset is described as a multi-class gastrointestinal illness dataset containing 8,000 images from eight unique categories, with 1,000 images per category. The authors note that the Kvasir-SEG segmented polyp dataset has been updated to improve quality.

2. **CVC-ClinicDB**: This dataset consists of 612 images derived from colonoscopy sequences, specifically for detecting adenomas. The images are at a resolution of 384x288 pixels and include ground truth masks corresponding to the polyp regions.

3. **ISIC2018**: This dataset includes 2,594 dermoscopic images along with their corresponding binary label images, which cover various skin diseases.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they utilized the **Kvasir-SEG** and **CVC-ClinicDB** datasets for their evaluations, which reinforces their importance in the study.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Kvasir-SEG**, the citation is:
  > Jha, D., Smedsrud, P. H., Riegler, M. A., et al. "Kvasir-seg: A segmented polyp dataset." In *International Conference on Multimedia Modeling (MMM)*, 2020, pp. 451–462.

- For **CVC-ClinicDB**, the citation is:
  > Bernal, J., Sánchez, F. J., Fernández-Esparrach, G., et al. "Wm-dova maps for accurate polyp highlighting in colonoscopy: Validation vs. saliency maps from physicians." *Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics*, vol. 43, pp. 99–111, 2015.

- For **ISIC2018**, the citation is:
  > Tschandl, P., Rosendahl, C., Kittler, H. "The ham10000 dataset, a large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions." *Scientific Data*, vol. 5, no. 1, 2018.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured for further processing or review.
