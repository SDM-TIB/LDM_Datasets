To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Repaint123: Fast and High-quality One Image to 3D Generation with Progressive Controllable 2D Repainting" by Junwu Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions conducting extensive experiments on multiple datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors typically provide information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention using the **RealFusion15 dataset** and the **test-alpha dataset** for their experiments. I will take note of these datasets and look for any additional details provided about them.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **RealFusion15 dataset**, the citation is:
> Luke Melas-Kyriazi, Iro Laina, Christian Rupprecht, and Andrea Vedaldi. *Realfusion: 360deg reconstruction of any object from a single image*. In CVPR, 2023.

For the **test-alpha dataset**, the citation is:
> Junshu Tang, Tengfei Wang, Bo Zhang, Ting Zhang, Ran Yi, Lizhuang Ma, and Dong Chen. *Make-it-3D: High-fidelity 3D creation from a single image with diffusion prior*. In ICCV, 2023.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **RealFusion15 Dataset** - Citation: Luke Melas-Kyriazi, Iro Laina, Christian Rupprecht, and Andrea Vedaldi. *Realfusion: 360deg reconstruction of any object from a single image*. In CVPR, 2023.
2. **test-alpha Dataset** - Citation: Junshu Tang, Tengfei Wang, Bo Zhang, Ting Zhang, Ran Yi, Lizhuang Ma, and Dong Chen. *Make-it-3D: High-fidelity 3D creation from a single image with diffusion prior*. In ICCV, 2023.

With this information, I can now proceed to format the dataset entries as needed for further processing or review.
