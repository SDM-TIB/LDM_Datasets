To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Reviews For Segment-Personalized Image Collection Summarization" by Monika Wysoczanska et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of property reviews to enhance image summarization, which suggests that there may be datasets related to user reviews and images.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention that they collected over 6000 real properties from the Booking.com platform, which indicates that there is a dataset derived from this collection. I will look for specific details about this dataset, such as its structure, size, and any relevant characteristics.

In the **dataset description**, the authors provide a breakdown of how they stratified their sampling based on geographical location, types of accommodation, and traveller experiences. They also mention that the dataset is split into two groups based on the number of images and reviews. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's composition.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details about the dataset, particularly in section A.1, where they define relevant image classes for different user segments. This section may provide insights into how the dataset is organized and the types of data it contains.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the dataset:

1. **Booking.com Dataset**: This dataset consists of over 6000 properties, including images and reviews from users. The authors note that the dataset was carefully curated to represent a real distribution in terms of geographical location, types of accommodation, and traveller experiences. The dataset is not publicly shared but can be accessed through the Booking.com platform.

For the full citation of the dataset, I will refer to the paper itself, as it is the primary source of this dataset:

- **Citation**: Wysoczanska, M., Beladev, M., Assaraf, K. L., Wang, F., Kleinfeld, O., Amsalem, G., & Harush Boker, H. (2024). *Leveraging Reviews For Segment-Personalized Image Collection Summarization*. In Proceedings of the IAAI Conference 2024.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I format the dataset details correctly and prepare them for any required output structure. This will include the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that all necessary information is included for future reference or analysis.
