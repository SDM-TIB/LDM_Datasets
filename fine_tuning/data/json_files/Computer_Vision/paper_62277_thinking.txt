To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating the Robustness of Text-to-image Diffusion Models against Real-world Attacks" by Hongcheng Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors perform extensive experiments, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the evaluation of text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs) and their robustness against real-world attacks. They mention the need for datasets to conduct these evaluations, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using two types of textual data for prompting the generation of T2I DMs: 

1. **ChatGPT generated prompts (ChatGPT-GP)**: This dataset consists of 50 prompts generated by querying ChatGPT for basic prompts used for image synthesis.

2. **SBU Corpus**: This dataset includes 50 image captions sourced from the SBU Corpus, which facilitates the investigation of the efficacy of their method in practical image-text generation tasks.

In the **real-world attack experiment section**, the authors introduce two additional datasets to provide a comprehensive evaluation of their attack method:

3. **DiffusionDB**: A large-scale dataset containing 14 million T2I prompts, which is referenced as a significant resource for evaluating the robustness of T2I models.

4. **LAION-COCO**: This dataset includes captions for 600 million images from the English subset of LAION-5B, generated using an ensemble of BLIP and CLIP models.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SBU Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Vicente Ordonez, Girish Kulkarni, and Tamara Berg. *Im2text: Describing images using 1 million captioned photographs*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, volume 24. Curran Associates, Inc., 2011.

- For **DiffusionDB**, the citation is:
  > Zijie J. Wang, Evan Montoya, David Munechika, Haoyang Yang, Benjamin Hoover, and Duen Horng Chau. *DiffusionDB: A large-scale prompt gallery dataset for text-to-image generative models*. arXiv:2210.14896 [cs], 2022.

- For **LAION-COCO**, the citation is:
  > Christoph Schuhmann, Richard Vencu, Romain Beaumont, Robert Kaczmarczyk, Clayton Mullis, Aarush Katta, Theo Coombes, Jenia Jitsev, and Aran Komatsuzaki. *LAION-400m: Open dataset of clip-filtered 400 million image-text pairs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.02114, 2021.

- The **ChatGPT-GP** dataset does not have a formal citation as it is generated content from the ChatGPT model.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
