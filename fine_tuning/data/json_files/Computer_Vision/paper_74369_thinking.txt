To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation with Image Embedding Balancing" by Xiangheng Shan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments across various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of semantic segmentation and the need for open-vocabulary tasks. They mention using the **COCO-Stuff** dataset for training and evaluating their model, which is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

In the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1**, the authors provide a detailed list of datasets used for training and evaluation. They mention:

1. **COCO-Stuff**: This dataset contains 171 densely annotated classes and includes 118K training images, 5K validation images, and 41K test images. It is used for training their model.

2. **Pascal VOC**: This dataset has 20 classes, with 1464 training images and 1449 validation images. It is used for evaluation.

3. **Pascal Context-59**: This dataset includes 5K training images and 5K validation images, with 59 classes annotated.

4. **Pascal Context-459**: Similar to Pascal Context-59, but with 459 classes annotated.

5. **ADE20K-150**: This dataset contains 20K training images and 2K validation images, with 150 classes annotated.

6. **ADE20K-847**: This dataset is a broader version of ADE20K with 847 classes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **COCO-Stuff**, the citation is:
  > Holger Caesar, Jasper Uijlings, and Vittorio Ferrari. *Coco-stuff: Thing and stuff classes in context*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 1209–1218, 2018.

- For **Pascal VOC**, the citation is:
  > Mark Everingham and John Winn. *The pascal visual object classes challenge 2012 (voc2012) development kit*. Pattern Anal. Stat. Model. Comput. Learn., Tech. Rep, 2007(1-45):5, 2012.

- For **Pascal Context**, the citation is:
  > Roozbeh Mottaghi et al. *The role of context for object detection and semantic segmentation in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 891–898, 2014.

- For **ADE20K**, the citation is:
  > Bolei Zhou et al. *Scene parsing through ade20k dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 633–641, 2017.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
