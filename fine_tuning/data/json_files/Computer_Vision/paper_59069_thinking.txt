To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Plane Neural Radiance Fields for Novel View Synthesis" by Youssef Abdelkareem et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of "challenging datasets" and specifically refer to the **ShapeNet dataset** and the **LLFF dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are likely central to their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experimental results** sections. In the **methodology**, the authors describe training on the **ShapeNet dataset** and conducting experiments on the **LLFF dataset**. They provide details about how these datasets are used, including the number of views and the training setup.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their method on these datasets, confirming their significance in the research. They also mention the **KITTI Raw dataset** in the context of generalization experiments, which is another dataset to note.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **ShapeNet Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Chang, A. X., Funkhouser, T. A., Guibas, L. J., Hanrahan, P., Huang, Q., Li, Z., Savarese, S., Savva, M., Song, H., Su, H., Xiao, J., Yi, L., & Yu, F. (2015). *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. ArXiv, vol. abs/1512.03012.

2. **LLFF Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Mildenhall, B., Srinivasan, P. P., Ortiz-Cayon, R., Kalantari, N. K., Ramamoorthi, R., Ng, R., & Kar, A. (2019). *Local light field fusion: Practical view synthesis with prescriptive sampling guidelines*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG).

3. **KITTI Raw Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Geiger, A., Lenz, P., Stiller, C., & Urtasun, R. (2013). *Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, 32(11), 1231-1237.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for future reference or analysis.
