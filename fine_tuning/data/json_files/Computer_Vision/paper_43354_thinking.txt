To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large-scale Uncertainty Estimation and Its Application in Revenue Forecast of SMEs" by Zebang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the importance of revenue forecasting for SMEs and mentions the use of historical revenue and trade data, which suggests that these might be the datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors describe their methodology and datasets in detail. Here, they mention that they extracted twelve sub-datasets from January to December 2018 and five sub-datasets from January to May 2019. I will note the specifics of these datasets, including their purpose and characteristics.

In section 5.1, the authors state that the datasets are derived from a large fintech services group that has served tens of millions of SMEs. They specifically mention using historical revenue and trade data for constructing their model. This indicates that the datasets are related to revenue and trade activities of SMEs.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are derived from internal data of a fintech services group, there may not be formal citations available for these datasets. Instead, I will note that the datasets are proprietary and derived from the fintech groupâ€™s operational data.

To summarize, the datasets I will extract from the paper are:

1. **Historical Revenue Data**: This dataset includes revenue figures for SMEs over a specified period, which is crucial for forecasting.
2. **Trade Data**: This dataset includes trade-related metrics for SMEs, which are also essential for the forecasting model.

Since these datasets are proprietary and specific to the fintech services group, I will note that they do not have formal citations but are referenced as internal datasets from the organization.

Finally, I will compile the information about these datasets, ensuring to highlight their significance in the context of the research and the lack of formal citations due to their proprietary nature.
