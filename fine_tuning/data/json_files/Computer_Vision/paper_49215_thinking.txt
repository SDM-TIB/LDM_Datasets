To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpreting diffusion score matching using normalizing flow" by Wenbo Gong and Yingzhen Li, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the introduction and methodology sections, where authors typically describe their experimental setup and the datasets used.

Next, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets in the **background or theoretical sections**. These sections may reference datasets used in previous studies or provide context for the current research. If the authors discuss any experiments or evaluations, I will note any datasets they refer to.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** for any datasets that may have been used for validation or comparison purposes. Authors often highlight the datasets they used to benchmark their methods in these sections.

After identifying potential datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial, as proper citation allows others to locate the datasets for their own research.

If the paper mentions any datasets without providing full citations, I will look for the original papers or sources cited by the authors. This may involve searching for the dataset names in academic databases or repositories.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly and concisely, ready for any further processing or presentation.
