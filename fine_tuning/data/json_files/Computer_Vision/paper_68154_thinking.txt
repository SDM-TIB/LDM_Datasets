To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RecRanker: Instruction Tuning Large Language Model as Ranker for Top-k Recommendation" by Sichun Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for evaluation or training.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of recommender systems and mention that they conducted experiments on three real-world datasets. This indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using three heterogeneous, real-world datasets: **MovieLens-100K**, **MovieLens-1M**, and **BookCrossing**. I will extract details about each dataset, including the number of users, items, ratings, and density, as these are crucial for understanding the datasets' characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide additional context about how these datasets were utilized in their evaluations. They mention that the MovieLens datasets are standard benchmarks in movie recommendation systems, while the BookCrossing dataset contains user-submitted book ratings.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

2. **MovieLens-1M**: 
   > F. M. Harper and J. A. Konstan. "The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context." *ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS)*, vol. 5, no. 4, pp. 1–19, 2015.

3. **BookCrossing**:

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its relevant details and full citations. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all necessary information for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
