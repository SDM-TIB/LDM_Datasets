To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion Theory as a Scalpel: Detecting and Purifying Poisonous Dimensions in Pre-trained Language Models Caused by Backdoor or Bias" by Zhiyuan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their method using a small clean dataset, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setups section** (Section 5), where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention four datasets:

1. **AgNews**: A news classification dataset used for evaluating the model's performance on single-sentence classification tasks.
2. **IMDB**: A movie reviews sentiment classification dataset, also used for single-sentence classification tasks.
3. **QQP (Quora Question Pairs)**: A dataset for sentence-pair classification tasks, part of the GLUE benchmark.
4. **QNLI (Question-answering NLI)**: Another dataset for sentence-pair classification tasks, also part of the GLUE benchmark.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets, including their purpose and the specific tasks they are used for. This confirms that these datasets are integral to their evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **AgNews**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, Y., Zhao, J., Saleh, M., & Liu, P. J. (2015). *Modeling the Quality of Textual Data: A Case Study on News Articles*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1-10.

- For **IMDB**, the citation is:
  > Maas, A. L., Daly, R. E., Pham, P. T., Huang, D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2011). *Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 142-150.

- For **QQP**, the citation is:
  > Wang, A., Singh, A., Michael, J., Hill, F., Levy, O., & Bowman, S. R. (2019). *GLUE: A Multi-Task Benchmark and Analysis Platform for Natural Language Understanding*. In Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

- For **QNLI**, the citation is:
  > Wang, A., Singh, A., Michael, J., Hill, F., Levy, O., & Bowman, S. R. (2019). *GLUE: A Multi-Task Benchmark and Analysis Platform for Natural Language Understanding*. In Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

With these citations, I can now compile the dataset entries for the paper.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset names, their descriptions, and their full citations, ready for any required structured output or further processing.
