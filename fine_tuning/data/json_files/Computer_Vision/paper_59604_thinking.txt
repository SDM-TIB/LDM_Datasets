To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the De-duplication of LAION-2B" by Ryan Webster et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of **LAION-2B**, which is a large image database containing two billion images. This indicates that this dataset is central to the research. The introduction further elaborates on the importance of large image databases for generative models, specifically mentioning **LAION-5B** and **LAION-2B-en** as significant datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors discuss the de-duplication of **LAION-2B** and provide insights into its structure and the results of their experiments. They also mention that the de-duplicated set and histograms can be found online, which reinforces the significance of **LAION-2B** in their work.

In the **conclusion**, the authors summarize their contributions, emphasizing the release of the de-duplicated datasets and their representative sets. This confirms that **LAION-2B** is the primary dataset used throughout the research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The references section provides the necessary details for citing **LAION-2B** and **LAION-5B**:

- For **LAION-2B**, the citation is:
  > Christoph Schuhmann, Richard Vencu, Romain Beaumont, Robert Kaczmarczyk, Clayton Mullis, Aarush Katta, Theo Coombes, Jenia Jitsev, and Aran Komatsuzaki. *LAION-400M: Open dataset of CLIP-filtered 400 million image-text pairs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.02114, 2021.

- For **LAION-5B**, the citation is:
  > Christoph Schuhmann, Romain Beaumont, Richard Vencu, Cade Gordon, Ross Wightman, Mehdi Cherti, Theo Coombes, Aarush Katta, Clayton Mullis, Mitchell Wortsman, et al. *LAION-5B: An open large-scale dataset for training next generation image-text models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.08402, 2022.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets and their citations. This will allow me to create structured entries for each dataset as needed for further processing or review.
