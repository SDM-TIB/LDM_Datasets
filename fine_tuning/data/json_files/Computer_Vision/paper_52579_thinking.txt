To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interacting Attention Graph for Single Image Two-Hand Reconstruction" by Mengcheng Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method outperforms existing methods on the **InterHand2.6M benchmark**, which indicates that this dataset is likely important for the research. The introduction further emphasizes the significance of large-scale datasets for two-hand reconstruction tasks.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section**, specifically **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **InterHand2.6M Dataset**: This dataset is highlighted as the only dataset with two-hand mesh annotations. The authors state that they utilized 366K training samples and 261K testing samples from this dataset, focusing on the interacting two-hand data.

2. **RGB2Hands Dataset**: This dataset consists of 4 sequences of videos featuring different types of two-hand interactions. The authors clarify that this dataset does not have mesh annotations and is used only for qualitative evaluation.

3. **EgoHands Dataset**: This dataset contains 48 egocentric videos capturing complex interactions between two people. Similar to RGB2Hands, it is used for qualitative evaluation and lacks mesh annotations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **InterHand2.6M Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gyeongsik Moon, Shoou-I Yu, He Wen, Takaaki Shiratori, and Kyoung Mu Lee. *Interhand2.6m: A dataset and baseline for 3D interacting hand pose estimation from a single rgb image*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2020.

- For the **RGB2Hands Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **EgoHands Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sven Bambach, Stefan Lee, David J. Crandall, and Chen Yu. *Lending a hand: Detecting hands and recognizing activities in complex egocentric interactions*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
