To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Recurrent Attentional Networks for Saliency Detection" by Jason Kuen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors performed experiments on several challenging saliency detection datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Saliency Training Datasets)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training their models. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **DUT-OMRON**: This dataset is referenced as a significant dataset for saliency detection, but I need to find the full citation in the references section.

2. **NJU2000**: Another dataset mentioned for training purposes, which also requires a full citation.

3. **RGBD Salient Object Detection dataset**: This dataset is specifically noted for its RGBD images, and I will look for its citation.

4. **ImageNet segmentation dataset**: A well-known dataset that is used for various computer vision tasks, including saliency detection. I will ensure to find its citation as well.

In the **References section**, I will locate the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For **DUT-OMRON**, the citation is:
  > C. Yang, L. Zhang, H. Lu, X. Ruan, and M.-H. Yang. *Saliency detection via graph-based manifold ranking*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3166–3173, 2013.

- For **NJU2000**, the citation is:
  > R. Ju, Y. Liu, T. Ren, L. Ge, and G. Wu. *Depth-aware salient object detection using anisotropic center-surround difference*. Signal Processing: Image Communication, 2015.

- For **RGBD Salient Object Detection dataset**, the citation is:
  > H. Peng, B. Li, W. Xiong, W. Hu, and R. Ji. *RGBD salient object detection: a benchmark and algorithms*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 92–109, 2014.

- For **ImageNet segmentation dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Guillaumin, D. Küttel, and V. Ferrari. *ImageNet auto-annotation with segmentation propagation*. Journal of Computer Vision, 110(3):328–348, 2014.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
