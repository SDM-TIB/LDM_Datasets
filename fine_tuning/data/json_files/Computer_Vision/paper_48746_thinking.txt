To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Model-based Face Reconstruction through Weakly-Supervised Outlier Segmentation" by Chunlu Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions experiments on the **NoW testset**, **CelebA-HQ**, and the **AR database**, indicating that these are likely datasets used in the study.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, particularly **section 4.1 (Experiment setting)**, where the authors specify the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **NoW Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a benchmark for evaluating shape reconstruction accuracy. It is crucial to note that the authors claim their method achieves state-of-the-art performance on this dataset.

2. **CelebA-HQ Dataset**: This dataset is used for training and validating the effectiveness of the fitting and segmentation methods. The authors mention that they follow the training protocol of this dataset.

3. **AR Database**: This dataset is also used for validating the segmentation accuracy of their method. The authors refer to the ground truth masks provided by this dataset for their experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **NoW Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Soubhik Sanyal, Timo Bolkart, Haiwen Feng, and Michael J. Black. *Learning to regress 3D face shape and expression from an image without 3D supervision*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 7763â€“7772, 2019.

- For the **CelebA-HQ Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), December 2015.

- For the **AR Database**, the citation is:
  > A. Martinez and Robert Benavente. *The AR face database*. Tech. Rep. 24 CVC Technical Report, 01 1998.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for further processing or review.
