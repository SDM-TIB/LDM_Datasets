To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling Polypharmacy and Predicting Drug-Drug Interactions using Deep Generative Models on Multimodal Graphs" by Nhat Khang Ngo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three multimodal networks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any explicit mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of drug-drug interactions and mentions the use of machine learning models, but I need to look for specific dataset names.

I will then focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In **section 4.1 (Polypharmacy side effects)**, the authors mention using a dataset introduced in Zitnik et al. (2018), which consists of 19,085 protein and 645 drug nodes, along with 964 polypharmacy side effects. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

In **section 4.2 (DrugBank Drug-Drug Interaction)**, the authors refer to the DrugBank dataset used in Ryu et al. (2018), which contains 191,400 drug-pair interactions among 1,704 drugs categorized into 86 types. This dataset is also essential for their analysis.

In **section 4.3 (Anticancer drug response)**, the authors mention using the CCLE dataset proposed by Ahmadi Moughari and Eslahchi (2020), which contains comprehensive information about drugs and cell lines. This dataset is relevant for their anticancer drug response predictions.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For the dataset from Zitnik et al. (2018):
   > Marinka Zitnik, Monica Agrawal, and Jure Leskovec. *Modeling polypharmacy side effects with graph convolutional networks*. Bioinformatics, 34(13):i457–i466, 2018. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/bty294. URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty294.

2. For the DrugBank dataset from Ryu et al. (2018):
   > Jae Yong Ryu, Hyun Uk Kim, and Sang Yup Lee. *Deep learning improves prediction of drug–drug and drug–food interactions*. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 115(18):E4304–E4311, 2018. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1803294115. URL: https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1803294115.

3. For the CCLE dataset from Ahmadi Moughari and Eslahchi (2020):
   > Fatemeh Ahmadi Moughari and Changiz Eslahchi. *ADRML: anticancer drug response prediction using manifold learning*. Scientific Reports, 10(1):1–18, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation for proper documentation and reference.
