To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion On Syntax Trees For Program Synthesis" by Shreyas Kapur et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of neural diffusion models for program synthesis and mentions applying the approach to inverse graphics tasks, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on four domain-specific graphics languages, which suggests that there may be datasets associated with these languages.

I will specifically look for any subsections that explicitly mention datasets, such as **4.1 Environments**. Here, the authors describe the environments they used for their experiments:

1. **CSG2D**: A 2D constructive solid geometry language where primitive shapes are added and subtracted to create more complex forms.
2. **CSG2D-Sketch**: An extension of CSG2D that simulates hand-drawn sketches.
3. **TinySVG**: A language featuring primitive shapes with color and commands for arranging and moving shapes.
4. **Rainbow**: A simplified version of TinySVG for ablation studies.

While these environments are described, I need to check if the authors provide specific dataset citations or references for these environments.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned in the context of these environments. For example, if the authors reference prior works that introduced these languages or datasets, I will note those citations.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as follows:

- For **CSG2D**, I will check if there is a specific citation provided in the references that describes the dataset or the original work that introduced it.
- For **CSG2D-Sketch**, I will look for any references that detail the sketch simulation method or dataset.
- For **TinySVG**, I will identify if there is a citation that describes the dataset or the language.
- For **Rainbow**, I will see if there are any references that provide context or details about this simplified version.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the complete citations formatted correctly for each dataset, as this is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

Once I have all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
