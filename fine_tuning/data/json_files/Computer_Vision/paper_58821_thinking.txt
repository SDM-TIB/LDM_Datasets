To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GTRL: An Entity Group-Aware Temporal Knowledge Graph Representation Learning Method" by Xing Tang and Ling Chen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting extensive experiments on **six real-world datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. They mention the following datasets:

1. **ICEWS14-full**: This dataset includes 7,128 entities and 205 relations, with a total of 74,845 training samples, 35,665 validation samples, and 4,412 test samples. The time granularity is 24 hours.

2. **ICEWS18-full**: This dataset contains 23,033 entities and 208 relations, with 1,734,399 training samples, 238,765 validation samples, and 21,351 test samples. The time granularity is also 24 hours.

3. **GDELT18-full**: This dataset has 7,691 entities and 219 relations, with 305,241 training samples, 27,407 validation samples, and 4,661 test samples. The time granularity is 15 minutes.

Additionally, the authors refer to three other datasets derived from the above datasets by filtering for country-specific events:

4. **ICEWS14**: A filtered version of ICEWS14-full.
5. **ICEWS18**: A filtered version of ICEWS18-full.
6. **GDELT18**: A filtered version of GDELT18-full.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **ICEWS** datasets, the citation is:
  > Elizabeth Boschee, Jennifer Lautenschlager, Sean Oâ€™Brien, Steve Shellman, James Starz, and Michael Ward. *ICEWS coded event data*. Harvard Dataverse, 2015.

- For **GDELT** dataset, the citation is:
  > Kalev Leetaru and Philip A. Schrodt. *GDELT: Global data on events, location, and tone, 1979-2012*. ISA Annual Convention, 2013.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
