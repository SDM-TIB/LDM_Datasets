To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conditional Image Generation with Score-Based Diffusion Models" by Georgios Batzolis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention using the **CelebA** and **Edges2shoes** datasets. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including any preprocessing steps mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide a complete picture of the datasets used in the research.

For the **CelebA dataset**, I will find the citation:
> Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), December 2015.

For the **Edges2shoes dataset**, I will locate its citation:
> Phillip Isola, Jun-Yan Zhu, Tinghui Zhou, and Alexei A. Efros. *Image-to-image translation with conditional adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

Now that I have the names and citations for the datasets, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and ready for presentation or further processing.
