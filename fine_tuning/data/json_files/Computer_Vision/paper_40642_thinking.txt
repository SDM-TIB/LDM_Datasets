To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variationally Inferred Sampling Through a Refined Bound" by Victor Gallego and David Rios Insua, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions "experimental evidence" and "state-space models for time-series data," which suggests that datasets may be involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), as this is typically where datasets are explicitly described. I will look for any subsections that detail the datasets used for experiments. In this case, I notice that the authors mention using synthetic datasets for their experiments, particularly in the context of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Dynamic Linear Models (DLM).

In **subsection 5.2**, the authors describe their experiments with the Mauna Loa monthly CO2 time series data. This is a specific dataset that I need to note down. 

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Mauna Loa dataset. The citation is typically formatted as follows:

- For the Mauna Loa CO2 dataset, the citation is:
  > Charles D. Keeling. *Atmospheric carbon dioxide record from Mauna Loa*. 2005.

Additionally, I will note that the authors mention using synthetic datasets for their HMM and DLM experiments, but they do not provide specific names or citations for these synthetic datasets, as they are generated for the purpose of the study.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Mauna Loa dataset and clearly indicate that the other datasets are synthetic and not explicitly named.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or downstream processing, ensuring that all relevant details are included.
