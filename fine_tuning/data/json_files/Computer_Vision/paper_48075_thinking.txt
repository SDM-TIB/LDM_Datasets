To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reconstructing Nodal Pressures in Water Distribution Systems with Graph Neural Networks" by Gergely HajgatÃ³ et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the findings are evaluated on data generated from three benchmark water distribution systems (WDSs), which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly state that they used three freely accessible benchmark WDSs for their numerical experiments. The specific datasets mentioned are:

1. **Anytown Water Distribution System**: This is described as a fictitious village with 22 junctions and 41 pipes. The dataset is used to evaluate the proposed method's performance.

2. **C-Town Water Distribution System**: Another fictitious village, this dataset contains 388 junctions and 429 pipes, providing a larger network for testing.

3. **Richmond Water Distribution System**: This dataset represents a real town in the UK with approximately 8000 inhabitants, consisting of 865 junctions and 949 pipes. It is used to assess the model's performance in a more realistic scenario.

In the **experiments section**, the authors also mention that the datasets are commonly used benchmark networks among the water resources management community and can be accessed online from the University of Exeter's website. This is crucial information for citing the datasets properly.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Anytown Water Distribution System**:
  > University of Exeter. *Centre for Water Systems*. URL: http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/engineering/research/cws/.

- For **C-Town Water Distribution System**:
  > University of Exeter. *Centre for Water Systems*. URL: http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/engineering/research/cws/.

- For **Richmond Water Distribution System**:
  > University of Exeter. *Centre for Water Systems*. URL: http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/engineering/research/cws/.

Since all three datasets are sourced from the same institution, I will ensure to mention that they are accessible from the University of Exeter's website.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
