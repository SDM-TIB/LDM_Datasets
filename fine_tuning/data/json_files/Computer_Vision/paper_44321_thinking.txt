To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MATHNET: Haar-Like Wavelet Multiresolution-Analysis for Graph Representation and Learning" by Xuebin Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments, which suggests that datasets are likely involved. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets mentioned.

Next, I will focus on **Section 5 (Experimental Study)**, where the authors provide statistical information about the datasets used for graph classification and regression tasks. In this section, they present a table (Table 2) that summarizes the datasets, including details such as the maximum, minimum, average number of nodes, average number of edges, number of graphs, and number of classes.

The datasets mentioned in this section are:

1. **PROTEINS**: A dataset consisting of protein structures represented as graphs.
2. **ENZYMES**: A dataset of proteins classified into enzyme classes.
3. **D&D**: A dataset of protein graphs for classifying structures.
4. **MUTAG**: A dataset of compounds represented as graphs for mutagenicity prediction.
5. **PointPattern**: A novel large-scale dataset composed of point patterns from statistical mechanics.
6. **QM7**: A dataset used for regression tasks in quantum chemistry.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be included in the dataset descriptions.

For example, I will find citations for:
- **PROTEINS**: Dobson et al. (2003)
- **ENZYMES**: Borgwardt et al. (2005)
- **D&D**: Dobson et al. (2003)
- **MUTAG**: Debnath et al. (1991)
- **PointPattern**: This dataset is newly introduced in this paper, so it may not have a citation yet.
- **QM7**: Rupp et al. (2012)

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset descriptions, including their names, details, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review, making sure to include all relevant details and citations.
