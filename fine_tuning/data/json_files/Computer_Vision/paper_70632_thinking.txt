To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dyadic Interaction Modeling for Social Behavior Generation" by Minh Tran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a framework for generating 3D facial motions in dyadic interactions and references a large dataset of human-human dyadic interactions called **CANDOR**. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to identify any datasets used for evaluation. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly list the datasets utilized in their experiments:

1. **CANDOR Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,656 conversations in English, with a total duration of over 850 hours and more than 7 million words. It includes rich audio, video, and speech transcripts, allowing for detailed analysis of vocal and facial expressions.

2. **ViCo Dataset**: This dataset contains 483 video sequences featuring 50 unique listeners, used for evaluating speaker-driven listener motion generation.

3. **LM_Listener Dataset**: An extended version of the dataset introduced in Learning2Listen, it includes 2,366 training segments, 222 validation segments, and 543 test segments of a single listener (Trevor Noah).

4. **BiWi Dataset**: This dataset comprises affective speech recordings and associated high-resolution, dynamic 3D facial geometry data, featuring recordings from 14 participants.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **CANDOR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Reece, A., Cooney, G., Bull, P., Chung, C., Dawson, B., Fitzpatrick, C., Glazer, T., Knox, D., Liebscher, A., Marin, S. (2023). The CANDOR corpus: Insights from a large multimodal dataset of naturalistic conversation. *Science Advances*, 9(13), eadf3197.

- For **ViCo Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhou, M., Bai, Y., Zhang, W., Yao, T., Zhao, T., Mei, T. (2022). Responsive listening head generation: A benchmark dataset and baseline. In *European Conference on Computer Vision*.

- For **LM_Listener Dataset**, the citation is:

- For **BiWi Dataset**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
