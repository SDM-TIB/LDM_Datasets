To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probabilistic Emulation of a Global Climate Model with Spherical DYffusion" by Salva Rühling Cachay et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a generative model for climate simulations, which suggests that datasets related to climate modeling may be discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their dataset and experimental setup. Here, they mention using a dataset consisting of **11 distinct 10-year-long simulations from the FV3GFS model**, saved every 6 hours. This indicates that the FV3GFS dataset is crucial for their experiments.

In **subsection 5.1 (Dataset and Experimental Setup)**, the authors provide more details about the dataset. They describe the dataset as being generated from the **Finite-Volume on a Cubed-Sphere Global Forecasting System (FV3GFS)**, which is a comprehensive global atmospheric model developed by NOAA. The dataset includes various atmospheric variables and is used for training and validation of their model.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the FV3GFS dataset. The authors reference the FV3GFS model in the context of their experiments, and I need to ensure I have the correct citation for it.

The citation for the FV3GFS model is:
> Linjiong Zhou, Shian-Jiann Lin, Jan-Huey Chen, Lucas M. Harris, Xi Chen, and Shannon L. Rees. *Toward convective-scale prediction within the next generation global prediction system*. Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 100(7):1225–1243, 2019. doi:10.1175/BAMS-D-17-0246.1.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **FV3GFS Dataset**: This dataset consists of 11 distinct 10-year-long simulations from the FV3GFS model, saved every 6 hours. It includes various atmospheric variables and is used for training and validation of the proposed model.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant dataset information from the paper.
