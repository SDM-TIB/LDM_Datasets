To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TexFusion: Synthesizing 3D Textures with Text-Guided Image Diffusion Models" by Tianshi Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the method and its applications, which may hint at the datasets used. The introduction typically discusses the context and significance of the research, often mentioning datasets that are foundational to the work.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors often describe the datasets used for validation or comparison, including their characteristics and the number of samples. In this paper, the authors mention that they collected **35 meshes of various content** and evaluated their method on **86 mesh-text pairs**. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, and I need to gather more details about it.

Next, I will check the **dataset description section** (which is likely found in the experiments or supplementary materials) to find specific names and details about the datasets. The paper lists various objects sourced from ShapeNet and other repositories, along with prompts used for texture synthesis. 

I will compile the information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details provided in the paper. For example, the paper mentions that the objects were obtained under specific licenses, which is important for citation purposes.

After gathering the dataset information, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. This may include academic papers or repositories where the datasets can be accessed. For instance, if the paper cites ShapeNet, I will look for the appropriate citation for ShapeNet in the references.

Finally, I will ensure that I write down the full citations for each dataset clearly, as this is crucial for proper attribution and further research. 

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and experiments sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Identify specific datasets and their characteristics in the dataset description section.
3. Compile the dataset names and descriptions.
4. Retrieve full citations from the references section.
5. Document the datasets with their full citations for clarity and completeness.
