To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PIE: Pseudo-Invertible Encoder" by Jan Jetze Beitler et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their model on the **MNIST** dataset, which indicates that this dataset is used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 5) to gather more details about the dataset. In section 5.1, the authors explicitly state that they trained the Gaussian Pseudo Invertible Encoder on the **MNIST digits dataset**. They describe the architecture used and the dimensionality reduction performed during the experiments, confirming the dataset's relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, and its citation is typically included in many papers. The standard citation for the MNIST dataset is:

> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. URL: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MNIST dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MNIST dataset, ensuring that it is clear and complete for any downstream processing or review.
