To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Imposing Higher-Level Structure in Polyphonic Music Generation using Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Constraints" by Stefan Lattner et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically discusses the context and relevance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe the training data used for their models. Here, they mention using MIDI files encoding the scores of the second movement of three Mozart piano sonatas, specifically from the **Mozart/Batik dataset**. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Mozart/Batik dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:
> Widmer, G. (2003). Discovering simple rules in complex data: a meta-learning algorithm and some surprising musical discoveries. Artificial Intelligence, 146(2), 129â€“148. doi:10.1016/S0004-3702(03)00016-X.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, particularly in the context of related work or methods. However, the primary dataset appears to be the Mozart/Batik dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
