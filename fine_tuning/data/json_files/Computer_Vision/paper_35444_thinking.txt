To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Convolutional AutoEncoder-based Lossy Image Compression" by Zhengxue Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved a 13.7% BD-rate decrement on the Kodak database images compared to JPEG2000, suggesting that the Kodak database is a dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experimental setup section** to gather more details about the datasets used. The authors mention using a subset of the ImageNet database consisting of 5500 images to train the CAE network. This is another dataset that needs to be documented.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors refer to the Kodak lossless image database, which they used for testing their method. This reinforces the importance of the Kodak database as a dataset utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets:

1. **Kodak Database**: Used for testing the proposed CAE-based image compression method. The authors mention that it consists of 24 uncompressed images with resolutions of 768 × 512 or 512 × 768.

2. **ImageNet Database**: A subset of this large-scale dataset was used for training the CAE network, specifically consisting of 5500 images.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Kodak Database**, the citation is:
  > Kodak Lossless True Color Image Suite. Available at: http://r0k.us/graphics/kodak/

- For the **ImageNet Database**, the citation is:
  > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L. Li, K. Li, and L. Fei-Fei. "ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 1-8, June 20-25, 2009.

With this information, I will create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will allow for proper referencing and acknowledgment of the datasets used in the research.
