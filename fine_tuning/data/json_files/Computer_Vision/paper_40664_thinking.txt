To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational Denoising Network: Toward Blind Noise Modeling" by Zongsheng Yue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a new method for blind image denoising, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will look deeper into the introduction and experimental sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenges of blind image denoising and the need for large datasets for training deep learning models. However, they do not name specific datasets here.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors describe their experiments. They mention using several datasets for evaluation, specifically:

1. **Set5**: A commonly used dataset for image restoration tasks, consisting of five images.
2. **LIVE1**: Another well-known dataset for image quality assessment, containing 29 images.
3. **BSD68**: A dataset with 68 images, often used for benchmarking image denoising algorithms.

The authors provide performance metrics on these datasets, indicating their significance in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Set5**, the citation is:
  > Jiwon Kim, Jung Kwon Lee, and Kyoung Mu Lee. *Accurate image super-resolution using very deep convolutional networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 1646–1654, 2016.

- For **LIVE1**, the citation is:
  > Z. Wang, A. C. Bovik, H. R. Sheikh, and E. P. Simoncelli. *Image quality assessment: From error visibility to structural similarity*. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 13(4):600–612, 2004.

- For **BSD68**, the citation is:
  > Pablo Arbelaez, Michael Maire, Charless Fowlkes, and Jitendra Malik. *Contour detection and hierarchical image segmentation*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 33(5):898–916, 2011.

Having gathered the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
