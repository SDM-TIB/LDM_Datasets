To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Restricting Greed in Training of Generative Adversarial Network" by Haoxuan You et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on several representative datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In **Section 4.2**, they mention the **Mixture of Gaussians dataset**, which is sampled from a mixture of 25 Gaussians arranged in a rectangle. This dataset is used to demonstrate the performance of their method.

In **Section 4.3**, the authors discuss the **CelebA Dataset**, which is a large-scale face dataset containing over 200,000 images. This dataset is crucial for evaluating the generative models they propose.

Then, I will look at **Section 4.4**, where they mention the **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, a well-known dataset of 32x32 natural images that is widely used in machine learning research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **References section**:

1. **Mixture of Gaussians Dataset**: This dataset does not have a specific citation provided in the paper, as it is a synthetic dataset created for the experiments.

2. **CelebA Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 3730-3738.

3. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images. 

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details for future reference or processing.
