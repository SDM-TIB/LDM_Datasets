To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLIP-NeRF: Text-and-Image Driven Manipulation of Neural Radiance Fields" by Can Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. In the abstract, the authors discuss their method's evaluation on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Photoshapes**: This dataset consists of 150,000 chairs rendered at a resolution of 128x128 pixels. The authors reference a previous work for the rendering protocol.

2. **Carla**: This dataset includes 10,000 cars rendered at a resolution of 256x256 pixels, using a driving simulator.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Photoshapes**, the citation is:
  > Keunhong Park, Konstantinos Rematas, Ali Farhadi, and Steven M Seitz. *Photoshape: Photorealistic materials for large-scale shape collections*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 37(6):1–12, 2018.

- For **Carla**, the citation is:
  > Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. *Carla: An open urban driving simulator*. In Conference on robot learning, pages 1–16. PMLR, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.

In summary, I have extracted the following datasets from the paper:

1. **Photoshapes**: 150K chairs rendered at 128x128 pixels.
   - Citation: Keunhong Park, Konstantinos Rematas, Ali Farhadi, and Steven M Seitz. *Photoshape: Photorealistic materials for large-scale shape collections*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 37(6):1–12, 2018.

2. **Carla**: 10K cars rendered at 256x256 pixels.
   - Citation: Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. *Carla: An open urban driving simulator*. In Conference on robot learning, pages 1–16. PMLR, 2017.

With this information, I am ready to proceed with any further tasks related to these datasets.
