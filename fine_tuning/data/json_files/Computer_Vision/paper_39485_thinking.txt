To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond Explainability: Leveraging Interpretability for Improved Adversarial Learning" by Devinder Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using different benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the use of gradient-based interpretability and mention that they conducted experiments on several benchmark datasets. This reinforces the expectation that datasets will be explicitly named in the subsequent sections.

I will then focus on the **experiments and results section** (Section 3), where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for their experiments. They specifically mention two datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. This dataset is commonly used for training machine learning models in image classification tasks.

2. **NIPS-W**: This dataset is a small subset derived from the ImageNet dataset, used in the NIPS 2017 adversarial attacks and defenses challenge. The authors mention that they randomly selected 500 images from this dataset for their experiments.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, 2009.

- For **NIPS-W**, the citation is:
  > A. K. et al. *Adversarial Attacks and Defences Competition*. CoRR, abs/1804.00097, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
