To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dual Conditioned Diffusion Models for Out-Of-Distribution Detection: Application to Fetal Ultrasound Videos" by Divyanshu Mishra et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in fetal ultrasound videos, which suggests that specific datasets may be used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors describe the datasets used. In this section, they mention that they utilized a fetal ultrasound dataset of **359 subject videos** collected as part of the **PULSE project**. The in-distribution dataset consists of **5 standard heart views** (3VT, 3VV, LVOT, RVOT, and 4CH), while the out-of-distribution dataset includes three non-heart anatomies: **fetal head, abdomen, and femur**. This provides a clear indication of the datasets involved.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the PULSE project, which is crucial for the dataset citation. The citation for the PULSE project is:

- **PULSE Project**: Drukker, L., Sharma, H., Droste, R., Alsharid, M., Chatelain, P., Noble, J.A., Papageorghiou, A.T. *Transforming obstetric ultrasound into data science using eye tracking, voice recording, transducer motion and ultrasound video*. Scientific Reports 11(1), 14109, 2021.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

1. **Fetal Ultrasound Dataset**: This dataset consists of 359 subject videos collected as part of the PULSE project, which includes 5 standard heart views and out-of-distribution classes of fetal head, abdomen, and femur.
   - Citation: Drukker, L., Sharma, H., Droste, R., Alsharid, M., Chatelain, P., Noble, J.A., Papageorghiou, A.T. *Transforming obstetric ultrasound into data science using eye tracking, voice recording, transducer motion and ultrasound video*. Scientific Reports 11(1), 14109, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries in the specified format for further processing.
