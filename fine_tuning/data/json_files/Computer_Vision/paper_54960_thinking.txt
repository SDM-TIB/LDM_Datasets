To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EMC2A-Net: An Efficient Multibranch Cross-channel Attention Network for SAR Target Classification" by Xiang Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **MSTAR dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used. Here, they describe the **MSTAR dataset** as follows:

- The MSTAR dataset includes ten different categories of military vehicles, such as BMP-2, T-62, and ZSU-234, collected under various conditions. The resolution of the images is specified as 0.3 m x 0.3 m, and the dataset is noted for its systematic and comprehensive nature.

The authors also mention that the MSTAR dataset is divided into three subsets: **Standard Operating Condition (SOC)**, **Extended Operating Conditions 1 (EOC-1)**, and **Extended Operating Conditions 2 (EOC-2)**. Each subset has specific characteristics and challenges, particularly regarding covariate shifts.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MSTAR dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **MSTAR dataset**, the citation is:
  > "Standard SAR ATR evaluation experiments using the MSTAR public release data set," in Proc. 3370 Algorithms Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery V, Orlando, FL: SPIE, 1998, pp. 566â€“573.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset details and prepare to format them according to the required structure.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **MSTAR Dataset**: A dataset containing SAR images of various military vehicles, collected under different conditions, with a resolution of 0.3 m x 0.3 m.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
