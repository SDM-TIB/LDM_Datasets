To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Delving Deep into Liver Focal Lesion Detection: A Preliminary Study" by Jiechao Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of large-scale annotated medical image data for liver lesion detection, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods** section, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors mention using CT images of liver masses over three phases: non-contrast-agent enhanced, arterial, and delayed. This indicates that there are specific datasets related to these imaging modalities.

I will also look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets. In this case, **Table 1** provides diagnostic details for each category of liver mass, indicating the number of patients and lesions used for training and testing. The training set includes 621 patients with specific counts for different types of lesions: 910 cyst lesions, 495 hemangiomas, and 173 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). This information is crucial for describing the datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific dataset citations, as it relies on existing large-scale annotated medical image data. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are derived from clinical CT imaging studies but do not have specific citations.

To summarize, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **CT Images of Liver Masses**: This dataset includes images from 621 patients, with a breakdown of lesions as follows:
   - 910 cyst lesions
   - 495 hemangiomas
   - 173 HCCs

Since the paper does not provide specific citations for these datasets, I will note that they are based on clinical imaging data and suggest that the authors may have used publicly available datasets or institutional data.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that I highlight the lack of specific citations for the datasets used in the study.
