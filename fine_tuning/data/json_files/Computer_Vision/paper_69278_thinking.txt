To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SudokuSens: Enhancing Deep Learning Robustness for IoT Sensing Applications using a Generative Approach" by Tianshi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. In the introduction, the authors discuss the challenges of data scarcity in IoT applications, which may lead to the identification of relevant datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Evaluation)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. The authors mention conducting experiments on three typical IoT datasets, which are likely to be explicitly named and described.

The datasets mentioned in this paper are:

1. **ACIDS (Acoustic-seismic Classification Identification Data Set)**: This dataset is used for vehicle detection and consists of seismic and acoustic sensor recordings. It includes 135 sessions across 9 vehicle types and 3 terrains, with an average of 45 minutes of recordings per target class.

2. **RealWorld-HAR**: This dataset is utilized for wearable-device-based human activity recognition. It captures data from 6 modalities across 15 human subjects, featuring 5 activities. Each session lasts around 10 minutes.

3. **Wireless-sensor-based human activity recognition dataset**: This dataset records Wi-Fi signal variations caused by indoor human activities, featuring 12 activities performed by 30 human subjects across 3 environments.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
