To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Logically Synthesized, Hardware-Accelerated, Restricted Boltzmann Machines for Combinatorial Optimization and Integer Factorization" by Saavan Patel et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **Methods, Experiments, or Results**. In these sections, authors usually describe the datasets used for training or evaluation, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics.

While reading through the paper, I will take note of any datasets that are explicitly named. For instance, if the authors mention using datasets for training their Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) or for benchmarking their results, I will highlight these mentions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset for integer factorization, I will look for the original source of that dataset in the references. If the dataset is a well-known benchmark, I will ensure to include its citation as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ready for further processing or review, while ensuring that the full citations are included for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
