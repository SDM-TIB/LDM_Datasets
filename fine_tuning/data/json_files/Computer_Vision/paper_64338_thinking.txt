To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reasoning with Latent Diffusion in Offline Reinforcement Learning" by Siddarth Venkatraman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of offline reinforcement learning and mentions the use of D4RL benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors refer to the **D4RL benchmarks** multiple times, indicating that these benchmarks are the datasets used for their experiments.

I will then check the **experiments section** to gather specific details about the datasets. The authors mention several tasks from the D4RL suite, including:

1. **maze2d-large-v1**
2. **antmaze-medium-diverse-v2**
3. **antmaze-large-diverse-v2**
4. **kitchen-partial-v0**
5. **kitchen-mixed-v0**
6. **halfcheetah-medium-expert-v2**
7. **walker2d-medium-expert-v2**
8. **hopper-medium-expert-v2**
9. **pen-human**
10. **hammer-human**
11. **door-human**
12. **relocate-human**
13. **pen-cloned**
14. **hammer-cloned**
15. **door-cloned**
16. **relocate-cloned**

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the D4RL benchmarks. The D4RL benchmarks are referenced in the paper, and I will look for the original source that describes these datasets.

The citation for the D4RL benchmarks is:
> Justin Fu, Aviral Kumar, Ofir Nachum, George Tucker, and Sergey Levine. *D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **maze2d-large-v1**
2. **antmaze-medium-diverse-v2**
3. **antmaze-large-diverse-v2**
4. **kitchen-partial-v0**
5. **kitchen-mixed-v0**
6. **halfcheetah-medium-expert-v2**
7. **walker2d-medium-expert-v2**
8. **hopper-medium-expert-v2**
9. **pen-human**
10. **hammer-human**
11. **door-human**
12. **relocate-human**
13. **pen-cloned**
14. **hammer-cloned**
15. **door-cloned**
16. **relocate-cloned**

And the full citation for the D4RL benchmarks is:
> Justin Fu, Aviral Kumar, Ofir Nachum, George Tucker, and Sergey Levine. *D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219, 2020.

With this information, I am ready to present the dataset entries in the required format.
