To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IMAGE AS FIRST-ORDER NORM+LINEAR AUTOREGRESSION: UNVEILING MATHEMATICAL INVARIANCE" by Yinpeng Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any explicit mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's contributions, and while it may not list datasets, it can hint at their usage.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation and testing. This section is crucial as it often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics relevant to the study.

In this paper, I will look for mentions of datasets related to image reconstruction and self-supervised learning tasks. I will pay attention to any figures or tables that might summarize the datasets or their properties.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using the **ImageNet dataset**, I will look for the citation that typically includes the authors, title, publication venue, and year. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will format the extracted information in a clear and organized manner, ready for further processing or review.
