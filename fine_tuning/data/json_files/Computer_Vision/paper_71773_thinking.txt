To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantum State Generation with Structure-Preserving Diffusion Model" by Yuchen Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for what the paper addresses.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail. This section typically contains explicit mentions of datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors discuss generating quantum states based on training data consisting of quantum states with three different levels of entanglement. This indicates that there are specific datasets involved, although they may not be publicly available.

I will also look for any **figures or tables** that might summarize the datasets or provide additional context about the data used in the experiments. For example, the paper mentions three labeled classes of data corresponding to quantum mixed states of a 4-qubit system. This suggests that the authors have created synthetic datasets for their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the datasets are original and created by the authors, I will note that as well. However, if they reference existing datasets or methodologies, I will ensure to include those citations.

In this case, the datasets mentioned are:

1. **Quantum Mixed States Dataset**: This dataset consists of quantum states with three different levels of entanglement, specifically designed for the experiments in this paper. Since it is a synthetic dataset created by the authors, I will note that it does not have a formal citation but is described in the methodology.

2. **Haar Measure on U(4)**: The authors mention using the Haar measure to sample quantum entanglement matrices. This is a well-known mathematical construct, and while it may not be a dataset in the traditional sense, it is crucial for understanding the data generation process. The citation for the Haar measure can be referenced from standard texts on quantum mechanics or linear algebra.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that full citations are provided where applicable. This will ensure that the extraction is thorough and useful for anyone looking to understand the datasets used in this research.
