To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Polarized-VAE: Proximity Based Disentangled Representation Learning for Text Generation" by Vikash Balasubramanian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the application of the proposed method to disentangle semantics and syntax of sentences, which suggests that datasets related to text generation or natural language processing might be involved.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly mention using the **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI)** dataset for their experiments. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

In section 3.1, the authors detail their evaluation methodology and mention that they use the SNLI dataset to carry out semantics-syntax separation of textual data. This confirms the dataset's relevance to their work.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SNLI dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Samuel Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, EMNLP 2015, pages 632â€“642. Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL).

With this information, I have identified the dataset used in the paper and its full citation. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as required. This structured approach ensures that I capture all necessary details about the dataset used in the research paper.
