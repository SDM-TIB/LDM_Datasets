To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FourierNet: Compact Mask Representation for Instance Segmentation Using Differentiable Shape Decoders" by Hamd ul Moqeet Riaz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of FourierNet on the **MS COCO 2017 benchmark**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will move to the **introduction** section. Here, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the context of instance segmentation and mentions the use of the COCO dataset, confirming its relevance.

In the **experiments section (IV)**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used. The authors state that they conducted experiments on the **COCO 2017 benchmark**, which is divided into training and validation splits. This section will provide more context on how the dataset was utilized.

I will also check the **related work** section to see if any other datasets are referenced, but it seems that the focus is primarily on the COCO dataset.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the COCO dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **MS COCO 2017**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and citations in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MS COCO dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I have accurately captured the necessary details and citations for downstream processing.
