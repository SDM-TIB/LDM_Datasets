To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LDTrack: Dynamic People Tracking by Service Robots using Diffusion Models" by Angus Fung, Beno Benhabib, and Goldie Nejat, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and the datasets section** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list and describe the datasets utilized in their experiments. This section typically contains detailed information about each dataset, including the number of images, resolution, and specific characteristics relevant to the study.

In this paper, the authors mention four datasets:

1. **InOutDoor (IOD) Dataset**: This dataset consists of 8,300 RGB-D images captured at a resolution of 950x540 pixels at 30 Hz. It includes sequences of people in various lighting conditions, collected using a Kinect sensor in both indoor and outdoor environments.

2. **Kinect Tracking Precision (KTP) Dataset**: This dataset contains 8,475 RGB images with a resolution of 640x480 pixels at 30 Hz. It features multiple sequences representing different robot motion patterns and includes instances of people often partially occluded.

3. **ISR Tracking (ISRT) Dataset**: Comprising 10,000 RGB images at a resolution of 640x480 pixels at 30 Hz, this dataset includes annotations for various object classes, focusing on people. It captures scenarios with occlusions and diverse poses.

4. **Robots in Crowded People Conferences (R-CPC) Dataset**: This dataset was collected by the authors and consists of 2,575 RGB-D images from multiple indoor university conferences. It includes dense crowds and various occlusion scenarios.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
