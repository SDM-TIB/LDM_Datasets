To extract datasets from the research paper titled "INTERPRETING UNCERTAINTY IN MODEL PREDICTIONS FOR COVID-19 DIAGNOSIS" by Gayathiri Murugamoorthy and Naimul Khan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a visualization framework using a Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network, which suggests that they likely used specific datasets for their experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various existing works that utilize chest X-ray images for COVID-19 diagnosis, but they do not specify any datasets yet. However, they mention the need for interpretability and uncertainty estimation, which implies that datasets are crucial for their analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section**. Here, the authors state that there is no single benchmark dataset available for COVID chest X-ray images. Instead, they compiled data from various open and public repository sources. They mention the segregation of images into four classes: COVID-19, Viral Pneumonia, Bacterial Pneumonia, and Normal, with specific counts for each class. This indicates that they have created a custom dataset from multiple sources.

The authors reference three specific repositories from which they compiled their dataset. I will need to extract the full citations for these sources from the **References section** of the paper. The relevant references are:

1. **COVID-19 Radiography Database**: 
   > Tawsifur Rahman. *COVID-19 Radiography Database*. Kaggle, 2020. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database.

2. **COVID Chest X-Ray Dataset**: 
   > IEEE 8023. *COVID Chest X-Ray Dataset*. GitHub, 2020. Retrieved from https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset.

3. **Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Dataset**: 
   > Paul Timothy Mooney. *Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Dataset*. Kaggle, 2020. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their sources, I will summarize the information for each dataset, including the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset and its citation, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete for future reference or processing.
