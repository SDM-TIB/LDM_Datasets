To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Credit Card Fraud Detection: A Neural Network and SMOTE Integrated Approach" by Mengran Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of credit card fraud detection and mentions the use of advanced methodologies, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors highlight the issue of imbalanced datasets in credit card transactions, indicating that they likely used a specific dataset for their experiments. 

Next, I will focus on **section 3.1 (DataSet Introduction)**, where the authors provide details about the dataset they used. They describe a dataset comprising European card transactions, which includes:

- **284,807 transactions** over a two-day period in September 2013.
- Only **492 transactions labeled as fraudulent** (0.172%).
- Features include principal components (V1-V28), 'Time,' 'Amount,' and the target label 'Class' (1 for fraud, 0 for non-fraud).

This section clearly outlines the dataset used in their study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, the dataset itself is not attributed to a specific paper or source in the text, which is common for proprietary datasets or those used in industry. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is based on European card transactions from September 2013, but it does not have a formal citation.

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

1. **European Card Transactions Dataset**: Contains 284,807 transactions over a two-day period in September 2013, with 492 labeled as fraudulent.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. 

In conclusion, I have identified the dataset used in the research paper and noted that it lacks a formal citation, which is important for proper documentation in research contexts.
