To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PC-Droid: Faster diffusion and improved quality for particle cloud generation" by Matthew Leigh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and conclusion sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of PC-Droid and its improvements over previous models, which suggests that datasets may be referenced in the context of performance evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the context of their work and any datasets used for training or evaluation. I will look for specific mentions of datasets or benchmarks that the authors have utilized.

In the **methods section**, I will pay close attention to any subsections that describe the datasets used for training and testing the models. The authors may provide details about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **results section**, I will check for any references to datasets used to validate the performance of the proposed model. The authors might compare their results against established benchmarks, which would indicate the datasets involved.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

From my reading, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **JetNet30**: This dataset is mentioned as a test set for evaluating the performance of the PC-Droid model. The authors describe it as containing jet data used for comparison against their generated jets.

   Full citation:
   > R. Kansal et al., JetNet30, 10.5281/zenodo.6975118 (2022).

2. **JetNet150**: This dataset is referenced as an extension of JetNet30, used for evaluating the model's performance with a larger number of constituents.

   Full citation:
   > R. Kansal et al., JetNet150, 10.5281/zenodo.6302240 (2022).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further research and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
