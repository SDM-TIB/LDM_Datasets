To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CU-Net: Real-Time High-Fidelity Color Upsampling for Point Clouds" by Lingdong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract highlights the importance of point cloud upsampling and mentions that the authors conducted experiments, which suggests that datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **FaceScape Dataset**: This dataset contains 16,940 human head models captured from 847 subjects performing 20 different expressions. The authors specify that they use 80% of the samples for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for evaluation. They also provide details about the point cloud processing, including the number of points and the voxelization process.

2. **MPEG 8i Dataset**: This dataset consists of 6 voxelized point cloud models. The authors mention that they downsample these models into a specific space and investigate various upsampling tasks.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **FaceScape Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Haotian Yang, Hao Zhu, Yanru Wang, Mingkai Huang, Qiu Shen, Ruigang Yang, and Xun Cao. *Facescape: A large-scale high quality 3D face dataset and detailed riggable 3D face prediction*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), June 2020.

- For the **MPEG 8i Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Maja KrivokuÄ‡a, Philip A. Chou, and Patrick Savill. *ISO/IEC 8i voxelized surface light field (8ivslf) dataset*. JTC1/SC29 WG11 (MPEG) input document m42914, July 2018.

Now that I have the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
