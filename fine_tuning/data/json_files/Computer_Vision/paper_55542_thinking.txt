To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning Based DOA Estimation for Hybrid Massive MIMO Receive Array with Overlapped Subarrays" by Yifan Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a deep learning method for DOA estimation but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **system model and simulation results sections**. These sections often contain details about the datasets used for training and testing the proposed methods. I will look for any references to datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **data reprocessing section**, the authors describe the input data as the sampled covariance matrix, which suggests that they might have used simulated data for their experiments. However, I need to confirm if they used any publicly available datasets or if they generated their own data.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets used for validation or comparison with other methods. If they do, I will take note of the dataset names and any relevant details provided.

Finally, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to extract the complete citation information for each dataset.

If I find any datasets, I will compile the information, including the dataset name, description, and full citation, to ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in this research.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
