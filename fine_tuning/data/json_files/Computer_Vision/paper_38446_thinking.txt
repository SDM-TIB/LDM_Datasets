To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised GANs via Auxiliary Rotation Loss" by Ting Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors tested their model on **IMAGENET**, which indicates that this dataset is likely to be one of the primary datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets they used. In **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, they mention four datasets:

1. **IMAGENET**: The authors describe it as the largest and most diverse image dataset, containing 1.3 million training images and 50,000 test images. They resize the images to 128 × 128 × 3 for their experiments.

2. **CIFAR10**: This dataset consists of 70,000 images, partitioned into 60,000 training instances and 10,000 test instances. The images are 32 × 32 × 3 in size.

3. **CELEBA-HQ**: This dataset contains 30,000 images, and they use the 128 × 128 × 3 version for their experiments.

4. **LSUN-BEDROOM**: This dataset has 3 million images, which are randomly partitioned into a test set of approximately 30,000 images and a training set containing the rest.

In the same section, the authors provide details about how they processed these datasets and the specific configurations used during training.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are as follows:

- For **IMAGENET**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **CELEBA-HQ**, the citation is:
  > Andrew Brock, Jeff Donahue, and Karen Simonyan. *Large Scale GAN Training for High Fidelity Natural Image Synthesis*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.11096, 2018.

- For **LSUN-BEDROOM**, the citation is:
  > Fisher Yu, Yinda Zhang, Shuran Song, Ari Seff, and Jianxiong Xiao. *LSUN: Construction of a Large-Scale Image Dataset Using Deep Learning with Humans in the Loop*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.03365, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
