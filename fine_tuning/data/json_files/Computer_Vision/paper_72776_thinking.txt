To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Truthful Aggregation of LLMs" by Ermis Soumalias et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the application of their auction mechanism in online advertising but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction elaborates on the context of the research but still lacks explicit references to datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 6) closely, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup, including user queries and advertisers, but they do not specify any publicly available datasets used for their experiments. Instead, they mention creating synthetic instances for testing their mechanism, which implies that no external datasets were utilized.

Since the paper does not reference any established datasets, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works of other authors. However, the references primarily consist of related works and do not include specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I conclude that there are no datasets explicitly mentioned or utilized from external sources. The experiments rely on synthetic data created by the authors themselves.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were extracted from this paper, as the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets for their experiments. Instead, they created their own synthetic instances for testing purposes. Therefore, there are no full citations to provide for datasets in this case.
