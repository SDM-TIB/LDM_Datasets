To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Federated Anomaly Detection for Multivariate Time Series Data" by Wei Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted empirical studies on **six public datasets**, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors provide a summary of the datasets used in **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**. Here, they list the datasets along with brief descriptions:

1. **2D Gesture**: This dataset records the X-Y coordinates of hand gestures in a video.
2. **SWaT**: This dataset contains data from a water treatment plant, consisting of 11 days of operations with both normal and attack data.
3. **ECG5000**: This dataset records ECG series from a patient with severe congestive heart failure.
4. **HAR Laying**: A human activity recognition dataset with six different activities performed by subjects.
5. **AerobicDigit**: This dataset contains Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC) data of spoken Arabic digits.
6. **UWave**: This dataset consists of x, y, z coordinates of gestures recorded by accelerometers.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
