To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mean field initialization of the Annealed Importance Sampling algorithm for an efficient evaluation of the Partition Function of Restricted Boltzmann Machines" by A. Prat Poua et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but the datasets are likely detailed in the **Datasets section**.

In the **Datasets section (Section IV)**, the authors describe several datasets used in their experiments. I will carefully note each dataset's name, characteristics, and any specific details provided about them. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **Gaussian Weights with Gaussian Moments (GWGM)**: This dataset consists of an extended matrix of weights characterized by Gaussian random numbers, with specific parameters for the number of visible and hidden units.

2. **MNIST Dataset**: The authors mention using a trained RBM with the MNIST dataset, specifically noting the number of hidden units.

3. **Classical Ising and Spin Glass models**: These models are described in detail, including their configurations and the number of spins involved.

4. **Two-dimensional square-lattice Ising model**: This dataset is also discussed, highlighting its complexity and the number of spins.

5. **2D Spin Glass (2DSG)**: Similar to the previous models, this dataset is characterized by its unique parameters and configurations.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

For example, the citation for the MNIST dataset is:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 2010. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist

I will also look for citations related to the Ising and Spin Glass models, which may reference foundational papers in statistical mechanics.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
