To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RESGRAD: Residual Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Text to Speech" by Zehua Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors verified their method on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset and Preprocessing)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **LJ-Speech**: This is a single-speaker dataset containing 13,100 English speech recordings from a female speaker, with a total duration of around 24 hours. The authors provide a link to the dataset for reference.

2. **LibriTTS**: This dataset is a multi-speaker corpus with recordings from 1,046 speakers. The authors specify that they used the clean subset for their experiments, detailing how they selected recordings for training and testing.

3. **VCTK**: Another multi-speaker dataset, which includes recordings from 108 speakers. The authors describe how they selected recordings for testing and training purposes.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **LJ-Speech**, the citation is:
  > Keith Ito and Linda Johnson. *The LJ speech dataset*. 2017. Available at: https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/

- For **LibriTTS**, the citation is:
  > Heiga Zen, Rob Clark, Ron J. Weiss, Viet Dang, Ye Jia, Yonghui Wu, Yu Zhang, and Zhifeng Chen. *Libritts: A corpus derived from librispeech for text-to-speech*. In Interspeech, 2019.

- For **VCTK**, the citation is:
  > Junichi Yamagishi. *English multi-speaker corpus for CSTR voice cloning toolkit*. 2012. Available at: https://datashare.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/3443

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will allow for easy reference and verification in future work or research.
