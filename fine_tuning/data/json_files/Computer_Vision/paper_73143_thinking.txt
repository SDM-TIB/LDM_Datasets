To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HC-GAE: The Hierarchical Cluster-based Graph Auto-Encoder for Graph Representation Learning" by Zhuo Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed HC-GAE model is evaluated on real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for tables or descriptions that list the datasets used for both node classification and graph classification tasks. In the paper, I find two tables: 

- **Table I** lists datasets for node classification, which includes:
  1. **Cora**: 2708 nodes, 5429 edges, 1433 features, 7 classes.
  2. **CiteSeer**: 3312 nodes, 4660 edges, 3703 features, 6 classes.
  3. **PubMed**: 19717 nodes, 44338 edges, 500 features, 3 classes.
  4. **Computers**: 13752 nodes, 245861 edges, 767 features, 10 classes.
  5. **Coauthor-CS**: 18333 nodes, 81894 edges, 6805 features, 15 classes.

- **Table II** lists datasets for graph classification, which includes:
  1. **IMDB-B**: 1000 graphs, average 19.77 nodes, average 96.53 edges, 2 classes.
  2. **IMDB-M**: 1500 graphs, average 13 nodes, average 65.94 edges, 3 classes.
  3. **PROTEINS**: 1113 graphs, average 39.06 nodes, average 72.82 edges, 2 classes.
  4. **COLLAB**: 5000 graphs, average 74.49 nodes, average 2457.78 edges, 3 classes.
  5. **MUTAG**: 188 graphs, average 17.93 nodes, average 19.79 edges, 1 class.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets used, which is common in many research papers. Instead, I will note that these datasets are widely recognized in the field of graph representation learning and can be referenced from their original sources.

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the information as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will prepare to format it according to the required structure for downstream processing.
