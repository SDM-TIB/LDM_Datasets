To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CDiffMR: Can We Replace the Gaussian Noise with K-Space Undersampling for Fast MRI?" by Jiahao Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that they demonstrated their method through extensive numerical and visual experiments, which suggests that datasets were used for these experiments. The introduction further discusses the challenges in MRI reconstruction and hints at the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experimental results** sections. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention the **FastMRI dataset** in the experimental results section. They describe how they used 684 proton-density weighted knee MRI scans from the official training and validation sets, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Now, I will gather the details about the **FastMRI dataset**. The paper states that the dataset consists of single-channel complex-value MRI data, specifically mentioning the number of cases used for training, validation, and testing, as well as the dimensions of the images.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citation for the FastMRI dataset is as follows:
> Zbontar, J., Knoll, F., Sriram, A., Murrell, T., Huang, Z., Muckley, M.J., Defazio, A., Stern, R., Johnson, P., Bruno, M., Parente, M., Geras, K.J., Katsnelson, J., Chandarana, H., Zhang, Z., Drozdzal, M., Romero, A., Rabbat, M., Vincent, P., Yakubova, N., Pinkerton, J., Wang, D., Owens, E., Zitnick, C.L., Recht, M.P., Sodickson, D.K., Lui, Y.W. *fastMRI: An Open Dataset and Benchmarks for Accelerated MRI*. arXiv e-prints p. arXiv:1811.08839 (Nov 2018).

After confirming the details and citation, I will summarize the dataset information. The only dataset mentioned in this paper is the FastMRI dataset, which is used for the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the necessary details, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper attribution. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
