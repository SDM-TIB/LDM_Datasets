To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Model-Agnostic Adversarial Defenses using Adversarially Trained Autoencoders" by Pratik Vaishnavi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method on the **MNIST** and **Fashion-MNIST** datasets, which suggests these are key datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup and confirm that they used **MNIST** and **Fashion-MNIST** for their evaluations. They also mention **CIFAR-10** in the context of their experiments, which is another dataset that needs to be noted.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

2. **Fashion-MNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

3. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 Dataset*. 2009. Available at: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the paper, along with proper citations for each.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
