To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Novel Exploration of Diffusion Process based on Multi-types Galton-Watson Forests" by Yanjiao Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will examine the **experiments or results section** of the paper, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. I will look for any specific datasets that were used for validation or testing of the proposed methods. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will look for any supplementary materials or appendices that might contain additional information about datasets used in the research.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their full citations, in a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes a clear description, the context of its use in the research, and the full citation, as this is essential for proper academic referencing.
