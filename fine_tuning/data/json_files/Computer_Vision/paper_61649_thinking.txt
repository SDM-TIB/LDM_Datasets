To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FaceDNeRF: Semantics-Driven Face Reconstruction, Prompt Editing and Relighting with Diffusion Models" by Hao Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experiments section typically details the datasets employed in the study.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for high-quality 3D data in various applications, hinting at the datasets they might have used. However, I need to look for specific names and descriptions of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using trained checkpoints of **EG3D** on three datasets:

1. **FFHQ (Flickr-Faces-HQ)**: This dataset is used for generating high-quality human faces. It contains 70,000 high-resolution images of human faces.
   
2. **AFHQv2**: This dataset consists of high-quality images of animals, specifically cats and dogs, and is used for training generative models.

3. **ShapeNet**: A large-scale dataset containing 3D models across various categories, which is often used for 3D object recognition and generation tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

The full citations I find are:

- For **AFHQv2**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
