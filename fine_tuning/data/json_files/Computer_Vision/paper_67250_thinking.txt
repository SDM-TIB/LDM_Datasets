To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Digital Histopathology with Graph Neural Networks: Concepts and Explanations for Clinicians" by Alessandro Farace di Villaforesta et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions using H&E slides of breast cancer, which suggests that there may be specific datasets related to histopathology.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the parts where the authors describe their approach to graph construction and classification. Here, they mention using the **PanNuke dataset** to train HoVer-Net, which contains segmentation masks for nearly 200,000 labelled nuclei across over 7,000 images. This is a significant dataset for my extraction.

In the same section, they also refer to the **BreAst Cancer Histology (BACH) dataset**, which consists of 400 H&E images of breast tissue, categorized into four classes: Normal, Benign, In-Situ, and Invasive. This dataset is crucial for their classification tasks.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **PanNuke dataset**, the citation is:
   > Jevgenij Gamper et al. "PanNuke Dataset Extension, Insights and Baselines". In: arXiv:2003.10778 [cs, eess, q-bio], Apr. 2020.

2. For the **BACH dataset**, the citation is:
   > Guilherme Aresta et al. "BACH: Grand challenge on breast cancer histology images". In: Medical Image Analysis, 56 (2019), pp. 122â€“139.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, ensuring to include their names, descriptions, and full citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
