To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative Artificial Intelligence Assisted Wireless Sensing: Human Flow Detection in Practical Communication Environments" by Jiacheng Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors discuss any existing datasets or benchmarks relevant to their research. This section often provides context and may reference datasets that are foundational to the work.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for specific details about the datasets used in the experiments. The authors may describe how they collected data or what datasets they utilized for training and testing their models. This section is crucial for identifying the datasets' names, sizes, and any specific characteristics.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors report performance metrics based on the datasets. They may provide insights into how well their methods performed on specific datasets, which can help confirm the datasets' relevance.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for the citation in the references to ensure I have the correct and complete reference.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections for dataset mentions.
2. Identify specific datasets used in the experiments.
3. Check the references section for full citations of each dataset.
4. Compile the dataset information for clarity and accessibility.
