To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-grained Hypergraph Interest Modeling for Conversational Recommendation" by Chenzhan Shang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on two benchmarks, **ReDial** and **TG-ReDial**, which indicates that these are the datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the datasets are discussed in **section 4.1 (Experiment Setup)**, where the authors provide statistics about the datasets used. They specifically mention:

1. **ReDial**: An English conversational recommendation dataset constructed through Amazon Mechanical Turk.
2. **TG-ReDial**: A Chinese conversational recommendation dataset created semi-automatically.

Both datasets are described in terms of the number of dialogues, users, items, and sparsity, which provides a good overview of their characteristics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **ReDial**, the citation is:
  > Raymond Li, Samira Ebrahimi Kahou, Hannes Schulz, Vincent Michalski, Laurent Charlin, and Chris Pal. *Towards Deep Conversational Recommendations*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 31 (NIPS 2018).

- For **TG-ReDial**, the citation is:
  > Kun Zhou, Yuanhang Zhou, Wayne Xin Zhao, Xiaoke Wang, and Ji-Rong Wen. *Towards Topic-Guided Conversational Recommender System*. In Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, COLING 2020.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets and their citations clearly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the key details and citations for each dataset, ensuring that the information is ready for review or further processing.
