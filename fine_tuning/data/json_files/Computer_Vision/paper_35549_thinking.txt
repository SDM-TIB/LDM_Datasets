To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modular Generative Adversarial Networks" by Bo Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on image generation and image-to-image translation tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they describe two datasets:

1. **ColorMNIST**: This is a synthetic dataset created based on the MNIST Dialog Dataset. It contains 50,000 images of size 64 Ã— 64, each featuring a digit with four randomly sampled attributes (number, color, style, and background color).

2. **CelebA**: This dataset contains 202,599 face images of celebrities, annotated with 40 binary attributes. The authors mention that they randomly sampled 2,000 images for testing and used the remaining images for training.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ColorMNIST**, the citation is:
  > Seo, P.H., Lehrmann, A., Han, B., Sigal, L. "Visual reference resolution using attention memory for visual dialog." In NIPS, 2017.

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., Tang, X. "Deep learning face attributes in the wild." In ICCV, 2015.

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the datasets with their respective citations. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
