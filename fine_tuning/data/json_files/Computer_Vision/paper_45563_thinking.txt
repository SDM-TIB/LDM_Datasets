To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-Autoregressive Predictive Coding for Learning Speech Representations from Local Dependencies" by Alexander H. Liu, Yu-An Chung, and James Glass, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of self-supervised speech representations, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will look deeper into the introduction and experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference various methods and prior works but do not specify datasets. However, they mention that their method is evaluated on speech tasks, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In **section 3.1 (Setup)**, the authors state that they learned speech representations from the **clean 360-hour subset of LibriSpeech**. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used. I will note down the details of this dataset.

Additionally, in the same section, they mention using the **Wall Street Journal corpus (WSJ)** for evaluating the representations. This is another dataset that I need to document.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **LibriSpeech dataset**, the citation is:
   > Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. *LibriSpeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In ICASSP, 2015.

2. For the **Wall Street Journal corpus (WSJ)**, the citation is:
   > Douglas Paul and Janet Baker. *The design for the Wall Street Journal-based CSR corpus*. In Speech and Natural Language Workshop, 1992.

With these citations, I now have the necessary information to describe each dataset used in the paper. I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for review or further processing.
