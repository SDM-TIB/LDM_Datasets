To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Markov Chain-Guided Graph Construction and Sampling Depth Optimization for EEG-Based Mental Disorder Detection" by Yihan Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and materials and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two disease datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Materials and Methods)**, particularly the subsection labeled **A. Datasets**. Here, the authors explicitly describe two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Schizophrenia (SZ) Dataset**: This dataset includes EEG recordings from 14 SZ patients and 14 healthy controls. The EEG signals were recorded for 15 minutes with a sampling rate of 250Hz, using nineteen electrodes according to the international 10-20 system. The reference for this dataset is provided as [24].

2. **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) Dataset**: This dataset consists of EEG recordings from 34 MDD patients and 30 healthy controls, collected during a 5-minute eye-closed resting-state EEG session at a sampling rate of 256 Hz. The reference for this dataset is given as [25].

To ensure I have the full citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **Schizophrenia (SZ) Dataset**, the citation is:
  > E. Olejarczyk and W. Jernajczyk. *Graph-based analysis of brain connectivity in schizophrenia*. PloS one, vol. 12, no. 11, p. e0188629, 2017.

- For the **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) Dataset**, the citation is:
  > W. Mumtaz, L. Xia, M. Yasin, S. Ali, and A. S. Malik. *A wavelet-based technique to predict treatment outcome for major depressive disorder*. PLoS ONE, vol. 12, no. 2, p. e0171409, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset clearly and concisely, ensuring that I include all relevant details such as the number of subjects, data collection methods, and any specific characteristics mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that is ready for further processing or review.
