To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Positional-Encoding Image Prior" by Nimrod Shabtay et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and specific characteristics. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets or their properties.

In this paper, I will pay special attention to any references to datasets used for tasks such as image denoising, super-resolution, or video processing, as these are likely to be key datasets for the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using the **Set14** and **Set5** datasets for super-resolution tasks, I will locate their full citations in the references. The citations typically include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear format for easy reference, making sure to highlight the importance of each dataset in the context of the research findings presented in the paper.
