To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep diffusion-based forecasting of COVID-19 by incorporating network-level mobility information" by Padmaksha Roy et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimentation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention key datasets used for the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experimentation section**, specifically **section IV (Datasets)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. Here, the authors mention several datasets:

1. **COVID-19 Data**: This dataset is collected from the public repository maintained by Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and the New York Times (NYT). It includes cumulative cases and deaths for each date and each county from May to December of 2020.

2. **SafeGraph POI based Mobility Data**: This dataset is sourced from SafeGraph and details the number of visits to points of interest (POIs) from various Census Block Groups (CBGs) on a daily basis.

3. **ML-Dataset**: This dataset is created for use in the DeepCOVID-19 model and includes features derived from both intra-county and inter-county mobility.

4. **Mobility-convoluted Covariate Features**: This dataset is based on the assumption that both inter and intra-county mobility significantly influence disease propagation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations may not always be explicitly stated for datasets, but I can infer them based on the sources mentioned in the text.

For the **COVID-19 Data**, the citation is:
> John Hopkins University. *COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University*. [Online]. Available: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

For the **SafeGraph POI based Mobility Data**, the citation is:
> SafeGraph. *SafeGraph Data*. [Online]. Available: https://www.safegraph.com

For the **ML-Dataset** and **Mobility-convoluted Covariate Features**, the authors do not provide specific citations, but I can note that they are derived from the previously mentioned datasets.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
