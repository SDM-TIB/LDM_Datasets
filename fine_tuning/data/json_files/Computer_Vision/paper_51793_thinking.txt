To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine Learning Enhances Algorithms for Quantifying Non-Equilibrium Dynamics in Correlation Spectroscopy Experiments to Reach Frame-Rate-Limited Time Resolution" by Tatiana Konstantinova et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for analysis or training.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsection titled "Data." Here, the authors describe the data collected from 65 XPCS experiments at the CHX beamline of NSLS-II. This section is crucial as it details the nature of the datasets used, including the number of experiments and the types of samples involved.

In the methods section, the authors mention that the data were collected from three different samples under various conditions, which indicates that there are multiple datasets involved. They also specify that there are a total of 492 two-time correlation functions (2T CFs) generated from these experiments, which will be important for understanding the scale of the datasets.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors refer to any specific datasets when discussing their findings or analyses. This may provide additional context or confirm the datasets mentioned earlier.

After identifying the datasets, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works that are referenced. This is essential for providing proper attribution and context for the datasets used in the study.

For the datasets mentioned in the paper, I will compile the following information for each dataset:

1. **Dataset Name**: A clear and concise name for the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including details such as the number of samples, types of measurements, and any relevant experimental conditions.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete citation for the dataset or the original work from which the dataset is derived.

Once I have gathered all this information, I will organize it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its description and citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly credited in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
