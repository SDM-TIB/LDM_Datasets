To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-to-end optimized image compression with competition of prior distributions" by Benoit Brummer and Christophe De Vleeschouwer, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that their experiments are based on a specific dataset, which is a good indication that there are datasets to extract. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Method)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using a training and validation dataset made of free-license images from Wikimedia Commons, specifically from the "Category: Featured pictures on Wikimedia Commons," which consists of 13,928 images. This is a clear dataset that I need to document.

Additionally, they mention using the **Kodak set** as a validation set, which is another dataset that needs to be cited. The Kodak set is a well-known dataset in image processing and compression research.

The authors also refer to the **CLIC professional test dataset** for testing, which is another dataset that should be included in my extraction.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Wikimedia Commons dataset**, while there is no formal citation provided in the references, I can cite it as:
   > Wikimedia Commons. *Category: Featured pictures on Wikimedia Commons*. Available at: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Featured_pictures_on_Wikimedia_Commons. Accessed: 2020-04-03.

2. For the **Kodak dataset**, the citation is:
   > True color kodak images. Available at: http://r0k.us/graphics/kodak/. Accessed: 2020-01-20.

3. For the **CLIC professional test dataset**, the citation is:
   > Challenge on learned image compression. Available at: http://challenge.compression.cc/tasks/. Accessed: 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
