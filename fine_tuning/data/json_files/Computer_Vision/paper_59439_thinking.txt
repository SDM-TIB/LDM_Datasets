To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Cross-Head Supervision for Crowd Counting with Noisy Annotations" by Mingliang Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. In the abstract, the authors mention that they conducted extensive experiments on the **ShanghaiTech** and **QNRF** datasets, indicating that these are the datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors provide specific information about the datasets:

1. **ShanghaiTech Dataset**: This dataset is divided into two parts:
   - **Part A** contains 482 images, with 300 for training and 182 for validation.
   - **Part B** contains 716 images, with 316 for training and 400 for validation.

2. **UCF-QNRF Dataset**: This dataset includes 1535 high-resolution images, with 1201 for training and 334 for validation.

The authors also mention that these datasets cover a range of scenarios from sparse to dense scenes, which is relevant for understanding their application in crowd counting.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **ShanghaiTech Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yingying Zhang, Desen Zhou, Siqin Chen, Shenghua Gao, and Yi Ma. *Single-image crowd counting via multi-column convolutional neural network*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1-8, 2016.

- For the **UCF-QNRF Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Haroon Idrees, Muhmmad Tayyab, Kishan Athrey, Dong Zhang, Somaya Al-Maadeed, Nasir Rajpoot, and Mubarak Shah. *Composition loss for counting, density map estimation and localization in dense crowds*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 1-16, 2018.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
