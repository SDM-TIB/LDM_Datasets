To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Disappearance of Timestep Embedding in Modern Time-Dependent Neural Networks" by Bum Jun Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a general overview of the study, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets used in experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as well as any textual descriptions that provide details about the datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets for their experiments. They provide some details about these datasets, such as the number of images and classes, which is crucial for understanding their context in the research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The CIFAR datasets are well-known, so I can retrieve their standard citations:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

Both datasets are often cited together since they originate from the same source.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured.
