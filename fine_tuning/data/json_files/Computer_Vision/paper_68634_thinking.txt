To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Foundation Models for Biomedical Image Segmentation: A Survey" by Ho Hin Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and background sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the paper reviews adaptations and integrations of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) across various medical imaging tasks and mentions "33 open datasets covered in our analysis." This suggests that there are multiple datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Challenges in Contemporary Medical Image Segmentation Tasks)**, where the authors mention a collection of 33 medical image segmentation datasets in Table 1. I will carefully examine this table to gather the names, details, and characteristics of each dataset.

In **Table 1**, the datasets are listed chronologically along with their respective modalities, anatomy, data size, label quality, and segmentation target types. I will extract the following datasets from this table:

1. **JSRT**: A dataset for chest X-ray images.
   - Citation: Shiraishi, J., Katsuragawa, S., Ikezoe, J., Matsumoto, T., Kobayashi, T., Komatsu, K., Matsui, M., Fujita, H., Kodera, Y., & Doi, K. (2000). Development of a digital image database for chest radiographs with and without a lung nodule: receiver operating characteristic analysis of radiologists’ detection of pulmonary nodules. *American Journal of Roentgenology*, 174(1), 71-74.

2. **VESSEL12**: A dataset for vessel segmentation in CT scans.
   - Citation: Rudyanto, R. D., Kerkstra, S., Van Rikxoort, E. M., Fetita, C., Brillet, P.-Y., Lefevre, C., Xue, W., Zhu, X., Liang, J., Öksüz, I., et al. (2014). Comparing algorithms for automated vessel segmentation in computed tomography scans of the lung: the vessel12 study. *Medical Image Analysis*, 18(7), 1217-1232.

3. **PROMISE12**: A dataset for prostate segmentation.
   - Citation: Litjens, G., Toth, R., van de Ven, W., Hoeks, C., Kerkstra, S., van Ginneken, B., et al. (2014). Evaluation of prostate segmentation algorithms for MRI: The PROMISE12 challenge. *Medical Image Analysis*, 18(2), 359-373.

4. **NCI-ISBI**: A dataset for prostate structures.
   - Citation: Bernard, O., Lalande, A., Zotti, C., Cervenansky, F., Yang, X., Heng, P.-A., et al. (2018). Deep learning techniques for automatic MRI cardiac multi-structures segmentation and diagnosis: is the problem solved? *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 37(11), 2514-2525.

5. **BTCV**: A dataset for abdominal organ segmentation.
   - Citation: Roth, H. R., Lu, L., Farag, A., Turkbey, E., Liu, J., & Summers, R. M. (2015). A new 2.5D representation for lymph node detection in CT. *The Cancer Imaging Archive*.

6. **TotalSegmentator**: A dataset with 117 organs labeled.
   - Citation: Wasserthal, J., Breit, H.-C., Meyer, M. T., Pradella, M., Hinck, D., et al. (2023). TotalSegmentator: Robust segmentation of 104 anatomic structures in CT images. *Radiology: Artificial Intelligence*, 5(5).

7. **BraTS**: A dataset for brain tumor segmentation.
   - Citation: Bakas, S., Akbari, H., Sotiras, A., Bilello, M., Rozycki, M., et al. (2017). Advancing the cancer genome atlas glioma MRI collections with expert segmentation labels and radiomic features. *Scientific Data*, 4(1), 1-13.

I will continue this process for all datasets listed in Table 1, ensuring I capture the full citation for each dataset as I go along.

After gathering all the datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets discussed in the paper, along with their authoritative citations.
