To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational Inference of Joint Models using Multivariate Gaussian Convolution Processes" by Xubo Yue and Raed Kontar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on both synthetic and real-world data, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors describe their data settings. In **Section 4.1**, they mention two types of data used in their experiments:

1. **Synthetic Data**: The authors describe how they generated synthetic data for their experiments, specifying the underlying model and parameters used. However, this is not a publicly available dataset but rather data generated for the purpose of the study.

2. **C-MAPSS Dataset**: This is a real-world dataset provided by NASA, which contains failure time data of aircraft turbofan engines and degradation signals from sensors. The authors reference this dataset and provide a link to where it can be accessed.

In the **References section**, I will look for the full citation of the C-MAPSS dataset. The authors refer to the work by Saxena & Goebel (2008) for more details about the dataset. The citation for this dataset is:

> Saxena, A. and Goebel, K. *Turbofan engine degradation simulation data set*. NASA Ames Prognostics Data Repository, 2008. Available at: https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Synthetic Data**: Generated for the experiments, not publicly available.
2. **C-MAPSS Dataset**: 
   - Citation: Saxena, A. and Goebel, K. *Turbofan engine degradation simulation data set*. NASA Ames Prognostics Data Repository, 2008. Available at: https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/.

With this information, I am ready to create the dataset entries as needed.
