To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Equivariant Networks for Crystal Structures" by Sékou-Oumar Kaba and Siamak Ravanbakhsh, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors perform experimental tests on the **Materials Project dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely significant for their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the increasing relevance of deep learning in materials science and reference the **Materials Project dataset** as a standard dataset for materials informatics. This reinforces the importance of this dataset in their work.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they perform experiments using the **Materials Project dataset**. They describe the dataset as comprising over 120,000 materials with complete specifications of their crystal structures and important physical properties obtained through high-throughput DFT calculations. This section provides additional context about the dataset's size and relevance.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Materials Project dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Jain, Anubhav, Ong, Shyue Ping, Hautier, Geoffroy, Chen, Wei, Richards, William Davidson, Dacek, Stephen, Cholia, Shreyas, Gunter, Dan, Skinner, David, Ceder, Gerbrand, et al. "Commentary: The Materials Project: A materials genome approach to accelerating materials innovation." *APL Materials* 1, no. 1 (2013): 011002.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors also mention the **Perov-5 dataset**, which is used for regression tasks related to the heat of formation computed through DFT. I will check the references for this dataset as well.

The citation for the **Perov-5 dataset** is:
> Castelli, Ivano E., Landis, David D., Thygesen, Kristian S., Dahl, Søren, Chorkendorff, Ib, Jaramillo, Thomas F., Jacobsen, Karsten W. "New cubic perovskites for one-and two-photon water splitting using the computational materials repository." *Energy & Environmental Science* 5, no. 10 (2012): 9034-9043.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
