To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Logistic Ensemble Models" by Bob Vanderheyden and Jennifer Priestley, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the development of predictive models in a regulated industry, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the methodology but still lacks specific dataset references.

Next, I will examine the **Methodology** and **Developing Logistic Regression Classifiers** sections, as these are likely to contain details about the datasets used in the study. In the section titled "Developing Logistic Regression Classifiers," the authors mention analyzing credit data for **11.8 million prospective business customers** provided by a major U.S.-based credit bureau, spanning **9 years from 2006 to 2014**. This indicates that a specific dataset is being utilized, but I need to find the exact name and citation for this dataset.

I will also check the **Literature Review** and **Findings** sections for any additional datasets mentioned or referenced. However, the focus seems to be on the methodology rather than on multiple datasets.

In the **Bibliography**, I will look for any references that might provide full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide a specific name for the dataset from the credit bureau, but it does reference various studies and methodologies that could be relevant for understanding the context of the data used.

Since the paper primarily discusses the methodology and does not provide a specific dataset name or citation, I will note that the dataset is described as credit data from a major U.S.-based credit bureau, but I cannot provide a full citation for it. 

Thus, I will summarize my findings as follows:

1. **Credit Data for Prospective Business Customers**: This dataset consists of 11.8 million records spanning 9 years (2006-2014) and is provided by a major U.S.-based credit bureau. However, the paper does not specify the name of the dataset or provide a citation.

Since I cannot find a full citation for the dataset, I will document the details I have gathered and note the absence of a formal citation. This will help in understanding the context of the research and the data used, even if the specific dataset citation is not available.
