To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Building robust classifiers through generation of confident out of distribution examples" by Kumar Sricharan and Ashok Srivastava, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors showcase their method on "hand-written characters as well as on a variety of natural image datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section**. In **section 3.1**, the authors mention using the **EMNIST dataset** for handwritten characters and the **FashionMNIST dataset** as the out-of-sample distribution. This is a clear identification of two datasets used in their experiments.

In **section 3.2**, the authors describe their experiments on various datasets, specifically mentioning **CIFAR**, **SVHN**, **ImageNet**, and **LSUN**. This indicates that these datasets are also part of their evaluation process.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each of these datasets:

1. For **EMNIST**, the citation is:
   > Gregory Cohen, Saeed Afshar, Jonathan Tapson, and André van Schaik. *EMNIST: An extension of MNIST to handwritten letters*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1702.05373, 2017.

2. For **FashionMNIST**, the citation is:
   > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

3. For **CIFAR**, the citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

4. For **SVHN**, the citation is:
   > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. In NIPS workshop on deep learning and unsupervised feature learning, volume 2011, page 5, 2011.

5. For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009. CVPR 2009. IEEE Conference on, pages 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

6. For **LSUN**, the citation is:
   > Fisher Yu, Ari Seff, Yinda Zhang, Shuran Song, Thomas Funkhouser, and Jianxiong Xiao. *LSUN: Construction of a large-scale image dataset using deep learning with humans in the loop*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.03365, 2015.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets from the paper effectively.
