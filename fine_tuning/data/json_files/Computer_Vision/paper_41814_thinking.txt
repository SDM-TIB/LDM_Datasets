To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Disentangled Representations for Human Retargeting by Multi-view Learning" by Chao Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses learning disentangled representations and mentions using various data sources, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment Results)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **HMD Dataset**: This dataset consists of images captured from head-mounted displays (HMD) with 123 different identities, each exhibiting a variety of facial expressions. The authors note that around 1,500 images are captured for each identity, which are gray-scale and normalized to 256x256.

2. **CMU Panoptic Dataset**: This dataset includes images of 32 identities making different poses, captured from multiple cameras. Each identity has around 7,000 images, and the dataset provides 3D pose information for each frame.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **HMD Dataset**, the authors do not provide a specific citation in the references, but they describe it in detail in the text. Therefore, I will note it as an internal dataset created by the authors.

- For the **CMU Panoptic Dataset**, the citation is:
  > H. Joo, T. Simon, X. Li, H. Liu, L. Tan, L. Gui, S. Banerjee, T. S. Godisart, B. Nabbe, I. Matthews, T. Kanade, S. Nobuhara, Y. Sheikh. *Panoptic studio: A massively multiview system for social interaction capture*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets, ensuring to include the full citations where applicable.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
