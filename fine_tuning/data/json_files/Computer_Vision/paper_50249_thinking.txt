To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SPACE-TIME GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS" by Samar Hadou, Charilaos I. Kanatsoulis, and Alejandro Ribeiro, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for their experiments. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for specific mentions of datasets. For instance, the authors might describe the datasets used for decentralized control applications, such as flocking and motion planning. I will note down the names of these datasets and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, types of data, and any specific characteristics that are highlighted.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial as it provides the necessary attribution and allows others to locate the datasets used in the research. I will ensure to extract the complete citation format, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the citation is not directly provided, I may need to perform a quick search to find the authoritative source for that dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's details.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and experiments sections to identify datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for detailed descriptions of datasets used.
3. Note down the names and characteristics of the datasets.
4. Check the references for full citations of each dataset.
5. Compile the information into a clear and structured format for review.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the research paper.
