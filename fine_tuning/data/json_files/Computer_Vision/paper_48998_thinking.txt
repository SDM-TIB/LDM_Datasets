To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tiled Squeeze-and-Excite: Channel Attention With Local Spatial Context" by Niv Vosco et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the investigation of channel attention mechanisms, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In **section 4.1 (Implementation Details)**, the authors mention that they evaluate their method on **ImageNet-1K**, **MS COCO**, and **Cityscapes** datasets. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

I will now gather detailed descriptions of each dataset:

1. **ImageNet-1K**: This dataset is widely used for image classification tasks and contains over a million images categorized into 1,000 classes. The authors use it to evaluate the performance of their proposed method in image classification.

2. **MS COCO**: The Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS COCO) dataset is used for object detection and segmentation tasks. It contains images with complex scenes and annotations for object instances, which makes it suitable for evaluating the performance of object detection models.

3. **Cityscapes**: This dataset is specifically designed for semantic segmentation tasks in urban environments. It contains high-resolution images with pixel-level annotations for various classes relevant to urban scenes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009.

- For **MS COCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, Lubomir Bourdev, Ross Girshick, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, C. Lawrence Zitnick, and Piotr DollÃ¡r. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

- For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:
  > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The Cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
