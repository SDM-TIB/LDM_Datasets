To extract datasets from the research paper titled "∆-DiT: A Training-Free Acceleration Method Tailored for Diffusion Transformers" by Pengtao Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on PIXART-α and DiT-XL," which suggests that these models were evaluated on specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In the paper, the authors state that they conducted experiments using the **MS-COCO2017** dataset and **PartiPrompts**. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their size, content, and any relevant characteristics.

In the **experimental settings section**, the authors specify that they used **1.632k prompts from PartiPrompts** and **5k prompts from the validation dataset of MS-COCO2017** for evaluation. This provides a clear indication of the datasets utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **MS-COCO2017**, the citation is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*.

2. For **PartiPrompts**, the citation is:

Trans. Mach. Learn. Res., 2022.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
