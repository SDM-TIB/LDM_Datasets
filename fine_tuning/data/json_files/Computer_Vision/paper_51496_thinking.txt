To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multilayer Graph Contrastive Clustering Network" by Liang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to data used in experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, I notice that there is a **Table I** that lists various datasets along with their characteristics, such as the number of nodes, relation types, edges, feature types, attributes, and classes. This table is crucial as it summarizes the datasets in a clear format.

From **Table I**, I can identify the following datasets:

1. **Cora**: A citation network with 2,708 nodes and 5,429 edges. The features are represented as a bag of words of keywords, and it has 7 classes.
2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network with 3,327 nodes and 4,732 edges, also using a bag of words of keywords for features and having 6 classes.
3. **Wiki**: A webpage network with 2,405 nodes and 17,981 edges, featuring a bag of words of keywords and 4 classes.
4. **ACM**: A paper network with 3,025 nodes and 2,210,761 edges, with two types of relations and 3 classes.
5. **IMDB**: A movie network with 4,780 nodes and 29,281 edges, featuring multiple relations and 4 classes.
6. **DBLP**: A paper network with 7,907 nodes and 98,010 edges, also with multiple relations and 4 classes.
7. **Amazon**: A product network with 7,621 nodes and 1,104,257 edges, featuring multiple relations and 4 classes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

- **Cora**: 
  > McCallum, A. K., Nigam, K., Rennie, J., & Seymore, K. (2000). Automating the construction of internet portals with machine learning. *Information Retrieval*, 3(2), 127-163.

- **Citeseer**: 
  > Giles, C. L., Bollacker, K. D., & Lawrence, S. (1998). Citeseer: An automatic citation indexing system. In *Proceedings of the third ACM conference on Digital libraries* (pp. 89-98).

- **Wiki**: 
  > Not explicitly cited in the paper; I will note that it may require further investigation to find the original source.

- **ACM**: 
  > Not explicitly cited in the paper; I will note that it may require further investigation to find the original source.

- **IMDB**: 
  > Not explicitly cited in the paper; I will note that it may require further investigation to find the original source.

- **DBLP**: 
  > Not explicitly cited in the paper; I will note that it may require further investigation to find the original source.

- **Amazon**: 
  > Not explicitly cited in the paper; I will note that it may require further investigation to find the original source.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for those that are available and note any datasets that require further citation research. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant dataset information from the paper.
