To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Lightweight Reconstruction Network for Surface Defect Inspection" by Chao Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of "multiple defect image sample sets," which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names and descriptions of these datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of detecting surface defects and mention various industrial applications, but I need to find specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **AITEX Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the textile industry, containing regular texture samples with a total of 149 positive and 5 negative examples.

2. **DAGM2007 Dataset**: This dataset includes samples with irregular textures and hidden defects, comprising 100 positive and 29 negative samples.

3. **Kylberg Sintorn Dataset**: This dataset has 50 positive and 5 negative samples.

4. **MVtech Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned as being used for comparative experiments, although specific sample sizes are not detailed.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **AITEX Dataset**, the citation is:
  > AITEX. *Textile Defect Dataset*. Available at: [insert URL if available].

- For the **DAGM2007 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > DAGM. *DAGM 2007 Dataset*. Available at: [insert URL if available].

- For the **Kylberg Sintorn Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kylberg Sintorn. *Kylberg Texture Dataset*. Available at: [insert URL if available].

- For the **MVtech Dataset**, the citation is:
  > MVtech. *MVTech Dataset for Surface Defect Detection*. Available at: [insert URL if available].

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
