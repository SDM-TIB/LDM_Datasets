To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OT-VP: Optimal Transport-guided Visual Prompting for Test-Time Adaptation" by Yunbei Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on **three stylistic datasets (PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome)** and one corrupted dataset (**ImageNet-C**). This gives me a clear starting point for the datasets I need to extract.

Next, I will proceed to the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of domain shifts and the importance of their method. They reiterate the use of the same four datasets mentioned in the abstract, confirming their relevance for the experiments.

In the **experiments section (Section 4)**, the authors provide further details about the datasets used. They mention:

1. **PACS**: A dataset consisting of four domains (Photos, Art, Cartoon, and Sketch) with 9,991 images across 7 classes.
2. **VLCS**: Comprising four domains (VOC2007, LabelMe, Caltech, and SUN09) with a total of 10,729 images in 5 classes.
3. **OfficeHome**: This dataset includes four domains (Art, Clipart, Product, Real) with 15,588 images in 65 classes.
4. **ImageNet-C**: A dataset containing corrupted images across 15 types of corruption, evaluated at the highest severity level.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **VLCS**:

  > Dan Hendrycks and Thomas Dietterich. *Benchmarking neural network robustness to common corruptions and perturbations*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.12261, 2019.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
