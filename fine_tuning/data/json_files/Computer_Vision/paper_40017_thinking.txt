To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating and Exploiting Probabilistic Monocular Depth Estimates" by Zhihao Xia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a common model for various depth estimation tasks, which may imply the use of specific datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will focus on any subsection that explicitly mentions datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup."

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they conducted extensive experiments on the **NYUv2 dataset**. This is a clear indication that this dataset is used for their evaluations.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the NYUv2 dataset. The citation for the NYUv2 dataset is:
> Nathan Silberman, Derek Hoiem, Pushmeet Kohli, and Rob Fergus. *Indoor segmentation and support inference from RGBD images*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2012.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the NYUv2 dataset is the primary dataset used for the experiments.

Now, I will compile the dataset information, including the full citation, into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details about the dataset used in the research.
