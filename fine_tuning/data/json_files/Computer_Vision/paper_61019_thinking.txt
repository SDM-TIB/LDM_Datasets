To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Empirical Study on the Language Modal in Visual Question Answering" by Daowan Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **VQA-CPv2** benchmark, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine the **Related Work section** to see if any additional datasets are referenced. The authors mention the **VQAv2** benchmark, which is another dataset used in the context of Visual Question Answering.

In the **Empirical Analysis section**, the authors explicitly state that they selected the **VQAv2** benchmark and its out-of-distribution benchmark, **VQA-CPv2**, for their experiments. This confirms that both datasets are central to their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **VQAv2**, the citation is:
   > Aishwarya Agrawal, Jiasen Lu, Stanislaw Antol, Margaret Mitchell, C Zitnick, Devi Parikh, and Dhruv Batra. *VQA: Visual Question Answering*. In International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 123(1):4–31, 2017.

2. For **VQA-CPv2**, the citation is:
   > Aishwarya Agrawal, Dhruv Batra, Devi Parikh, and Aniruddha Kembhavi. *Don’t just assume; look and answer: Overcoming priors for visual question answering*. In CVPR, pages 4971–4980, 2018.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now prepare to format this information according to the required structure, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation for future reference.
