To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for One-stage Object Detector using Offsets to Bounding Box" by Jayeon Yoo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on various domain adaptation benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Cityscapes**: This dataset consists of clear city images under driving scenarios, with a total of 2,975 training images and 500 validation images. It includes 8 categories such as person, rider, car, truck, bus, train, motorcycle, and bicycle.

2. **Foggy Cityscapes**: This is a synthetic dataset created by adding fog to the Cityscapes images. It is used as the target domain to simulate domain shifts caused by weather conditions.

3. **Sim10k**: This dataset contains 10,000 synthesized city images and is used for adaptation from synthetic data to real data, focusing on the car class.

4. **KITTI**: This dataset consists of 7,481 images and is used for adaptation to a different camera modality, also focusing on the car category.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:
  > Cordts, M., Omran, M., Ramos, S., Rehfeld, T., Enzweiler, M., Benenson, R., Franke, U., Roth, S., & Schiele, B. (2016). The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For **Foggy Cityscapes**, the citation is:
  > Sakaridis, C., Dai, D., & Van Gool, L. (2018). Semantic foggy scene understanding with synthetic data. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV).

- For **Sim10k**, the citation is:

- For **KITTI**, the citation is:
  > Geiger, A., Lenz, P., & Urtasun, R. (2012). Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
