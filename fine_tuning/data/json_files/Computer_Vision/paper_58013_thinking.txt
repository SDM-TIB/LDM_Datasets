To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised High Impedance Fault Detection Using Autoencoder and Principal Component Analysis" by Yingxiang Liu, Mohammad Razeghi-Jahromi, and James Stoupis, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their method using real data collected from a 4.16 kV distribution system, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the dataset was collected during the testing of ABB’s feeder protection system REF 550. The measurements include three-phase voltages and currents collected in a 4.16 kV distribution system near a hospital. The authors specify that high impedance faults were staged on different surfaces (grass, water puddle, soil, and asphalt) and that measurements of normal load were also recorded.

The dataset description includes:
- The number of samples per cycle (320).
- The conditions under which the high impedance faults were created (e.g., dropping the conductor on various surfaces).
- The duration of the faults and the nature of the measurements taken.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference their dataset collection in relation to the ABB REF 550 system, which is documented in the following sources:

1. For the ABB REF 550 system:
   > D. B. Ratan Das, “System for detection of high impedance fault,” 19th International Conference on Electricity Distribution, 2007.

2. For the ABB REF 550 documentation:
   > “Ref 550 advanced feeder protection and control - abb,” https://library.e.abb.com/public/64e517269f719a5bc12573af006d2dd2/REF_550_DB41-902%20Rev.E.pdf.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

In summary, I will document the dataset as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: ABB REF 550 Dataset
- **Description**: Measurements of three-phase voltages and currents collected in a 4.16 kV distribution system, including high impedance faults staged on various surfaces.
- **Full Citation**: 
  > D. B. Ratan Das, “System for detection of high impedance fault,” 19th International Conference on Electricity Distribution, 2007.
  > “Ref 550 advanced feeder protection and control - abb,” https://library.e.abb.com/public/64e517269f719a5bc12573af006d2dd2/REF_550_DB41-902%20Rev.E.pdf.

After gathering all necessary information, I will format the dataset entry accordingly for further processing.
