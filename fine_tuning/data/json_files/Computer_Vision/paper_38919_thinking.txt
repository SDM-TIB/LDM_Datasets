To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Relevance Factor VAE: Learning and Identifying Disentangled Factors" by Minyoung Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract states that the model is evaluated on "several benchmark datasets," which indicates that there are specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention three datasets: **3D-Faces**, **Sprites**, and **Teapots**. I will take note of the descriptions provided for each dataset, including the number of images and the factors of variation.

1. **3D-Faces Dataset**: This dataset contains synthetic face images rendered from a 3D face model, with four factors of variation: subject ID (50), azimuth (21), elevation (11), and lighting along the horizon (11). 

2. **Sprites Dataset**: This dataset consists of 737,280 binary images of three shapes (oval, square, and heart), undergoing variations in four geometric factors: scale (6 variation modes), rotation (40), and X, Y translation (32 modes each), resulting in five factors total.

3. **Teapots Dataset**: This dataset contains 200,000 images of a teapot across five different sources of variation: azimuth, elevation, and the color of the teapot object.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **3D-Faces Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Paysan, P., Knothe, R., Amberg, B., Romdhani, S., & Vetter, T. (2009). A 3D Face Model for Pose and Illumination Invariant Face Recognition. In *Proceedings of the Sixth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance*.

- For the **Sprites Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Matthey, L., Higgins, I., Hassabis, D., & Lerchner, A. (2017). dSprites: Disentanglement testing Sprites dataset. *URL: https://github.com/deepmind/dsprites-dataset/*.

- For the **Teapots Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Eastwood, C., & Williams, C. K. I. (2018). A framework for the quantitative evaluation of disentangled representations. In *Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR*.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
