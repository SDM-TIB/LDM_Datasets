To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Imagic: Text-Based Real Image Editing with Diffusion Models" by Bahjat Kawar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the introduction of a benchmark called **TEdBench**, which suggests that there may be a dataset associated with it.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and evaluation. In this section, they mention conducting a user study using **TEdBench**, which is described as a collection of 100 pairs of input images and target texts for complex non-rigid image editing tasks. This indicates that TEdBench is a dataset specifically created for evaluating their method.

I will also check the **conclusion and acknowledgments sections** for any additional context or references to datasets that may not have been detailed in the main body of the paper.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets:

1. **TEdBench**: This dataset consists of 100 pairs of input images and target texts designed for evaluating complex non-rigid image editing tasks. The authors state that they hope TEdBench will serve as a standardized evaluation set for future research in this area.

Next, I will look for the full citation for the TEdBench dataset. Since it is a novel dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:

- For **TEdBench**, the citation is:
  > Bahjat Kawar, Shiran Zada, Tali Dekel, Huiwen Chang, Oran Lang, Omer Tov, Inbar Mosseri, and Michal Irani. *Imagic: Text-Based Real Image Editing with Diffusion Models*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the dataset and its citation, ready for any further processing or review.
