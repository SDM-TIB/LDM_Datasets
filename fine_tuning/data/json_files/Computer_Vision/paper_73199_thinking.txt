To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multistable Shape from Shading Emerges from Patch Diffusion" by Xinran Nicole Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the model and its capabilities, but it may not specify datasets directly. The introduction often discusses the context and previous work, which might include references to datasets used in related studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and testing their model. In this paper, the authors mention training their model on a dataset of **8000 images of 400 unique objects** rendered from different viewing directions. This indicates that there is a specific dataset they utilized.

In the **experimental setup details**, the authors provide more information about the dataset, stating that it is built from the **UniPS dataset** and includes images rendered with Lambertian shading. This is crucial information as it specifies the source of the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the UniPS dataset. The citation for the dataset is likely to be included in the references, and I will ensure to extract it accurately.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **UniPS Dataset**: This dataset contains approximately 8000 images of 400 unique objects rendered from various viewing angles using Lambertian shading. It is used for training the model to predict surface normals from shading images.

Next, I will compile the full citation for the UniPS dataset, which is likely to be referenced in the paper. If the citation is not explicitly stated, I will look for the original source of the UniPS dataset in the references.

Finally, I will ensure that I have all the necessary details about the dataset, including its purpose, size, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research. This will allow me to create a comprehensive entry for the dataset that adheres to the required format.

In summary, I will extract the dataset information step-by-step, ensuring to include the full citation for the UniPS dataset as it is critical for proper attribution and further research reference.
