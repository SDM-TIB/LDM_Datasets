To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Style Transfer and Self-Supervised Learning Powered Myocardium Infarction Super-Resolution Segmentation" by Lichao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any statements that indicate the use of specific datasets. The authors mention the use of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images, which suggests that these may be part of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the part where the authors describe their pipeline and models. Here, they mention the construction of a hybrid dataset that includes LGE images from publicly available datasets, specifically **ACDC** and **LiVScar**. This indicates that these datasets are integral to their research.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about their private dataset, which consists of 277 unlabeled DTI images and 271 labeled LGE images. They also mention that 77 DTI-LGE image pairs share identical segmentation masks, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the **references section**:

1. **ACDC Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Bernard, O., Lalande, A., Zotti, C., Cervenansky, F., Yang, X., Heng, P.-A., Cetin, I., Lekadir, K., Camara, O., Ballester, M. A. G., et al. "Deep Learning Techniques for Automatic MRI Cardiac Multi-Structures Segmentation and Diagnosis: Is the Problem Solved?" *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, vol. 37, no. 11, pp. 2514â€“2525, 2018.

2. **LiVScar Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Mansi, T., McLeod, K., Pop, M., Rhode, K. S., Sermesant, M., and Young, A. A. "Statistical Atlases and Computational Models of the Heart. Imaging and Modelling Challenges." In *Lecture Notes in Computer Science*, vol. 8896, 2015, p. 296.

Additionally, I will note the private dataset mentioned, which consists of DTI and LGE images, but since it is not publicly available, it will not have a formal citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included for those that are publicly available. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
