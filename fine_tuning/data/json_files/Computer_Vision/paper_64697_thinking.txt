To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simulation-Based Design of Bicuspidization of the Aortic Valve" by Alexander D. Kaiser et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the objective and methods but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. This section provides context and background but does not seem to reference any specific datasets either.

Moving on to the **methods** section, I will look for any descriptions of data collection or datasets used in the simulations. The authors describe the construction of model valves and the use of patient-specific geometries, but they do not mention any external datasets.

In the **results** section, I will look for any data presented in tables or figures. The authors provide scalar metrics and comparisons of different valve configurations, but again, there are no references to external datasets.

Next, I will check the **discussion** section for any mention of datasets used in previous studies or comparisons made with existing datasets. The authors reference various studies but do not provide specific datasets.

Finally, I will review the **references** section to see if any datasets are cited in the context of previous research. The references include various studies related to aortic valves and fluid dynamics, but they do not specify datasets that were used in this research.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no explicit datasets mentioned or utilized from external sources. The research primarily focuses on simulations and model constructions based on theoretical principles rather than on existing datasets.

Since no datasets were found, I will not be able to provide full citations for any datasets as none were identified in the paper. If I were to find datasets, I would ensure to document their names, descriptions, and full citations as per the required format.
