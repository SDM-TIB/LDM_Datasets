To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Visual Tracking via Convolutional Networks" by Kaihua Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it often highlights the benchmarks used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **CVPR2013 tracking benchmark dataset** for their experiments. This dataset is crucial for evaluating the performance of their proposed method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CVPR2013 tracking benchmark dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Wu, Y., Lim, J., & Yang, M.-H. (2013). Online object tracking: A benchmark. In Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 2411â€“2418.

Since the paper primarily discusses the CVPR2013 dataset, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the full citation, into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately and comprehensively.
