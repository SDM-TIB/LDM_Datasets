To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ridge Regression and Provable Deterministic Ridge Leverage Score Sampling" by Shannon R. McCurdy, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit references to datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **results and experiments sections**. In these sections, the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

In the paper, the authors mention using **multi-omic data from lower-grade glioma (LGG) tumor samples** collected by the TCGA Research Network. This indicates that there is a specific dataset being used, and I will need to gather more details about it.

I will also check the **acknowledgments and references sections** for any citations related to the datasets. The references may provide full citations for the datasets or data sources used in the study.

From the text, I can identify the following dataset:

1. **TCGA Lower-Grade Glioma (LGG) Dataset**: This dataset consists of multi-omic data from 280 tumor samples, including various types of genomic data such as mutations, DNA copy number alterations, and RNA expression data. The authors mention that the data is publicly available and hosted by the Broad Institute’s GDAC Firehose.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset:

- For the **TCGA Lower-Grade Glioma (LGG) Dataset**, the citation is:
  > The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. (2015). Comprehensive, Integrative Genomic Analysis of Diffuse Lower-Grade Gliomas. *The New England Journal of Medicine*, 372(26), 2481–2498. https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1402121

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
