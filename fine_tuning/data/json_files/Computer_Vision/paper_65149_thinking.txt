To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Implicit Concept Removal of Diffusion Models" by Zhili Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the **Implicit Concept Dataset (ICD)**, which is a key dataset for the research. This indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to look for.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they mention three specific datasets that comprise the ICD:

1. **ICD-QR**: This dataset contains images with QR codes embedded in 25% of the images. It consists of 833 samples sourced from the PokÃ©mon dataset.

2. **ICD-Watermark**: This dataset includes images with watermarks, with 50% of the images containing such elements. It comprises 160,000 samples sourced from the CC12M dataset.

3. **ICD-Text**: This dataset consists of images containing text, with 100% of the images incorporating text. It contains 1,000,000 samples sourced from the LAION dataset.

In the **table presented in section 5**, the authors provide a summary of the datasets, including their sample sizes and sources, which confirms the details I need.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **ICD-QR**, the citation is:
  > Pinkney, J.N.M. *Pokemon blip captions*. https://huggingface.co/datasets/lambdalabs/pokemon-blip-captions/ (2022).

- For **ICD-Watermark**, the citation is:
  > Changpinyo, S., Sharma, P., Ding, N., Soricut, R. *Conceptual 12M: Pushing web-scale image-text pre-training to recognize long-tail visual concepts*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021.

- For **ICD-Text**, the citation is:
  > Schuhmann, C., Vencu, R., Beaumont, R., et al. *Laion-400m: Open dataset of clip-filtered 400 million image-text pairs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.02114 (2021).

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research.
