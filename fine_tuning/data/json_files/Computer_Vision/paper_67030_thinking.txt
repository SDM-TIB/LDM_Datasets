To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structural Pruning for Diffusion Models" by Gongfan Fang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the empirical assessment was conducted across several datasets, which indicates that multiple datasets are likely discussed in the paper. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors explicitly mention six datasets: **CIFAR-10**, **CelebA-HQ**, **LSUN Church**, **LSUN Bedroom**, and **ImageNet-1K**. I will note down the details provided for each dataset, including their dimensions and any relevant characteristics mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

The citations I will extract are as follows:

1. **CIFAR-10**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

2. **CelebA-HQ**:
   > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Large-scale celebfaces attributes (celeba) dataset*. Retrieved August, 15(2018):11, 2018.

3. **LSUN Church**:
   > Fisher Yu, Ari Seff, Yinda Zhang, Shuran Song, Thomas Funkhouser, and Jianxiong Xiao. *LSUN: Construction of a large-scale image dataset using deep learning with humans in the loop*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.03365, 2015.

4. **LSUN Bedroom**:
   > Fisher Yu, Ari Seff, Yinda Zhang, Shuran Song, Thomas Funkhouser, and Jianxiong Xiao. *LSUN: Construction of a large-scale image dataset using deep learning with humans in the loop*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.03365, 2015.

5. **ImageNet-1K**:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work.
