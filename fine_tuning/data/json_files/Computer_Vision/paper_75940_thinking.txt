To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-label Cluster Discrimination for Visual Representation Learning" by Xiang An et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **LAION-400M dataset**, which is a significant clue that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup and the datasets they utilized. 

In **section 4.1 (Experimental Setting)**, the authors state that their models are pre-trained on the **LAION-400M dataset**. This dataset is described as containing a large number of image-text pairs, which is crucial for their experiments.

Additionally, in the **appendix**, the authors provide a detailed list of datasets used for evaluation, including:

1. **LAION-400M**: This dataset is mentioned multiple times throughout the paper, indicating its importance in the experiments. It contains 400 million image-text pairs and is used for training their models.

2. **COYO-700M**: Another dataset mentioned, which consists of image-text pairs and is used for comparison in their experiments.

3. **Food101, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Birdsnap, SUN397, Stanford Cars, FGVC Aircraft, VOC2007, DTD, Pets, Caltech101, Flowers102, MNIST, FER2013, STL10, EuroSAT, RESISC45, GT-SRB, KITTI, Country211, PCAM, UCF101, Kinetics700, CLEVR, Hateful Memes, SST2, and ImageNet**: These datasets are listed in the appendix as part of the evaluation metrics for their experiments.
