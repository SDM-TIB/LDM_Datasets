To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Cost-Sensitive Deep Belief Network for Imbalanced Classification" by Chong Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the proposed method is evaluated on both benchmark datasets and a real-world dataset for fault diagnosis, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant subsections that might provide detailed descriptions. In this paper, the authors mention using **58 benchmark datasets** from the KEEL dataset repository for their experiments. I will note this as it indicates a significant number of datasets used for evaluation.

I will then check the **experiments section** to find specific details about these datasets. The paper includes a **Table II** that summarizes the details of the 58 binary-class imbalanced datasets, including their imbalance ratios, number of attributes, and the number of training and testing samples. This table will be crucial for extracting specific dataset information.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. Since the paper uses datasets from the KEEL repository, I will cite the repository itself as the source for these datasets.

The citation for the KEEL dataset repository is:
> Alcala-Fdez, J., Sanchez, L., Garcia, S., del Jesus, M. J., Ventura, S., Garrell, J., Otero, J., Romero, C., Bacardit, J., Rivas, V. M. et al. (2009). KEEL: A software tool to assess evolutionary algorithms for data mining problems. *Soft Computing*, 13(3), 307-318.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its relevant details, including the full citation for the KEEL repository. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all necessary information accurately and comprehensively.
