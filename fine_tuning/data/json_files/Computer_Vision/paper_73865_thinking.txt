To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Disentangled Representation via Variational AutoEncoder for Continuous Treatment Effect Estimation" by Ruijing Cui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on continuous treatment effect estimation, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any explicit mentions of datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors describe their experiments and mention the datasets they utilized. They specifically refer to:

1. **Synthetic Datasets (Simu(1) to Simu(5))**: These datasets are generated to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The authors describe the structure and characteristics of these datasets, including the number of covariates and observations.

2. **IHDP Dataset**: The authors mention that this dataset originated from the Infant Health Development Program and was modified for continuous treatment effect estimation. They provide details about the number of subjects and covariates.

3. **News Dataset**: This dataset consists of news items from The New York Times corpus, which was adapted for continuous treatment estimation. The authors provide a brief description of how this dataset was processed.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **IHDP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Brooks-Gunn, J., Liaw, F.R., & Klebanov, P.K. (1992). Effects of early intervention on cognitive function of low birth weight preterm infants. *The Journal of Pediatrics*, 120(3), 350-359.

- For the **News Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bica, I., Jordon, J., & van der Schaar, M. (2020). Estimating the effects of continuous-valued interventions using generative adversarial networks. In *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems* (pp. 16434-16445).

The synthetic datasets (Simu(1) to Simu(5)) do not have a formal citation as they are generated for the study, but I will note their characteristics as described in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the IHDP and News datasets, while summarizing the synthetic datasets based on the information provided in the paper. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details regarding the datasets used in the research.
