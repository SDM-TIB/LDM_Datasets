To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Free-Hand Sketch" by Peng Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method on a "million-scale sketch dataset," which indicates that a specific dataset is being used. I will note this as a potential dataset.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors state that they evaluate their self-supervised representation learning framework on the **QuickDraw 3.8M dataset**, which is a million-scale subset of the Google QuickDraw dataset. This is a clear identification of a dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the QuickDraw dataset. The citation for the QuickDraw dataset is as follows:
> Ha, D., & Eck, D. (2018). A neural representation of sketch drawings. In ICLR.

Additionally, I will ensure that I note any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, particularly in the context of related work or comparisons. However, the primary dataset used for their experiments appears to be the QuickDraw dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset in the final output.

In summary, the key steps I will take are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify any datasets mentioned.
2. Review the experiments section for explicit mentions of datasets used in the study.
3. Check the references section for full citations of the identified datasets.
4. Compile the dataset information, ensuring to include full citations.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper.
