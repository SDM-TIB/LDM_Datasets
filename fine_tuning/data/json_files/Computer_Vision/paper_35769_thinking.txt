To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HEXACONV" by Emiel Hoogeboom et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on the **AID aerial scene classification dataset** and the **CIFAR-10 benchmark**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 5, the authors explicitly mention the **CIFAR-10** dataset, describing it as consisting of 60,000 images of 32 by 32 pixels across 10 classes. They also mention the **Aerial Image Dataset (AID)**, which contains 10,000 satellite images of 400 by 400 pixels and 30 target classes. This confirms that both datasets are used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

2. For the **Aerial Image Dataset (AID)**, the citation is:
   > Gui-Song Xia, Jingwen Hu, Fan Hu, Baoguang Shi, Xiang Bai, Yanfei Zhong, Liangpei Zhang, and Xiaoqiang Lu. *AID: A Benchmark Data Set for Performance Evaluation of Aerial Scene Classification*. IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 2017.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 images of 32x32 pixels across 10 classes, widely used for benchmarking image classification algorithms.
- **Aerial Image Dataset (AID)**: A dataset containing 10,000 satellite images of 400x400 pixels with 30 target classes, specifically designed for aerial scene classification tasks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
