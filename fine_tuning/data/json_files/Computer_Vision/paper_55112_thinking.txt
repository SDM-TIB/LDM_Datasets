To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Occlusion-Robust Multi-Sensory Posture Estimation in Physical Human-Robot Interaction" by Amir Yazdani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any indications of datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their studies. In this paper, the authors mention conducting a human subject study and using a **12-camera Optitrack MoCap system** as the gold standard for posture estimation. This indicates that the MoCap system is a dataset of sorts, as it provides the ground truth for comparison.

Additionally, I will look for any references to other datasets or tools used in the study. The authors mention using **OpenPose** for 2D posture estimation, which is a software tool rather than a dataset, but it is important to note its role in the methodology.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or systems mentioned. The paper cites various works, and I will ensure to extract the relevant citations for the datasets used.

Based on my reading, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **Optitrack MoCap System**: This dataset is used as the gold standard for posture estimation. The citation for this system is not explicitly provided in the paper, but I will note that it is a widely recognized motion capture system.

2. **OpenPose**: While not a dataset, it is crucial to mention that the authors used OpenPose for generating 2D postures from video frames. The citation for OpenPose is:
   > Zhe Cao, Gines Hidalgo, Tomas Simon, Shih-En Wei, and Yaser Sheikh. *OpenPose: realtime multi-person 2D pose estimation using Part Affinity Fields*. IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence 43, 1 (2019), 172â€“186.

3. **Human Subject Study Data**: The authors conducted a human subject study with 8 participants, but they do not provide a specific dataset name. I will note that the data collected from this study is significant for the research.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper along with their full citations.
