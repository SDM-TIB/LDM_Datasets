To extract datasets from the research paper titled "QGAN: Quantized Generative Adversarial Networks" by Peiqi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments conducted on **CIFAR-10** and **CelebA**, indicating that these are the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) to confirm the details about these datasets. The authors explicitly state that they used the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, and the **CelebA dataset**, which contains over 200,000 celebrity face images. This confirms that both datasets are indeed utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset of images*. 2009. URL: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3730â€“3738, 2015. URL: http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets used in the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
