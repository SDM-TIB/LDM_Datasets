To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Environment reconstruction on depth images using Generative Adversarial Networks" by Lucas P. N. Matias et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for robust perception systems and mentions the use of stereo cameras, which suggests that datasets related to depth images may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss intelligent transportation systems and the importance of accurate depth and visual information. They mention the challenges posed by occlusions and the need for precise data, which may lead to the identification of specific datasets used in their experiments.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets they used for their evaluations. They refer to the **KITTI dataset** and the **CityScapes dataset** as the primary datasets for their experiments. I will extract the details about these datasets:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: This dataset is a benchmark for intelligent transportation systems research, collecting images from various urban scenarios in Karlsruhe, Germany. It includes stereo RGB pairs, which are essential for depth estimation tasks.

2. **CityScapes Dataset**: This dataset contains images from multiple German cities under various weather conditions. It has been post-processed and annotated for semantic and instance information, and disparity images are calculated from it, making it suitable for depth reconstruction tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **KITTI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2012.

- For the **CityScapes dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mario Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sergio Ramos, et al. *The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
