To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fault Localization for Buggy Deep Learning Framework Conversions in Image Recognition" by Nikolaos Louloudakis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it mentions the use of various deep learning models, it does not explicitly name any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the conversion of deep learning models and the potential faults that can arise. They mention using pre-trained models from different frameworks, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their approach to fault localization and repair. They mention conducting evaluations using three widely used image recognition models: **MobileNetV2, ResNet101, and InceptionV3**. However, they do not specify the datasets used for testing these models in this section.

Moving on to the **preliminary evaluation section**, the authors state that they performed pairwise comparisons using the **ILSVRC 2017 object detection test dataset**. This is a crucial piece of information as it identifies a specific dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ILSVRC 2017 dataset. The citation for this dataset is:

- **ILSVRC 2017 Dataset**:
  > O. Russakovsky, J. Deng, H. Su, J. Krause, S. Satheesh, S. Ma, Z. Huang, A. Karpathy, A. Khosla, M. Bernstein, A. C. Berg, and L. Fei-Fei. "ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge." *International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV)*, vol. 115, no. 3, pp. 211â€“252, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citation for the ILSVRC 2017 dataset as it is critical for proper attribution.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a clear format that can be used for further processing or review.
