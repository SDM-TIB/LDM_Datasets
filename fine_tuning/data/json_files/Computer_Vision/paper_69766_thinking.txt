To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SDXL-Lightning: Progressive Adversarial Diffusion Distillation" by Shanchuan Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors open-source their distilled SDXL-Lightning models, which suggests that they may have used specific datasets for training or evaluation. The introduction discusses the method and its applications, but I need to look for explicit mentions of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the **distillation procedure**. In this section, the authors mention that they distilled their models on a subset of **LAION** and **COYO** datasets. This is a crucial finding, as it indicates the datasets used for their experiments.

I will then look for more details about these datasets in the **references section** to ensure I can provide full citations. The references section lists the following relevant citations:

1. **LAION**: 
   > Christoph Schuhmann et al. "LAION-5b: An open large-scale dataset for training next generation image-text models." In Thirty-sixth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track, 2022.

2. **COYO**:
   > Minwoo Byeon et al. "Coyo-700m: Image-text pair dataset." GitHub repository, 2022. Available at: https://github.com/kakaobrain/coyo-dataset.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

- **LAION**: A large-scale dataset used for training generative models, specifically mentioned in the context of distillation.
- **COYO**: An image-text pair dataset also utilized in the distillation process.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or processing.
