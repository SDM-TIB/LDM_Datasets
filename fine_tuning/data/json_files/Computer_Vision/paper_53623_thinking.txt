To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MESH2IR: Neural Acoustic Impulse Response Generator for Complex 3D Scenes" by Anton Ratnarajah et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset for training the MESH2IR model, specifically referring to the GWA IR dataset. This indicates that there is at least one dataset that is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into the **related works** section, particularly section 2.4, where the authors discuss various indoor 3D scene datasets and IR databases. Here, they mention the **3D-FRONT dataset**, which is used to provide indoor 3D environments for generating impulse responses.

Then, I will focus on the **methodology** section, particularly section 3.2, where the authors describe the training dataset for MESH2IR. They specify that the model is trained on the **GWA dataset**, which consists of 2 million impulse responses simulated on indoor 3D environments represented as meshes from the 3D-FRONT dataset. This section provides detailed information about the dataset used for training.

In the **experiments** section, the authors validate their model using the datasets mentioned earlier, confirming their relevance and importance in the context of the research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **GWA Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Zhenyu Tang, Rohith Aralikatti, Anton Ratnarajah, and Dinesh Manocha. *GWA: A Large High-Quality Acoustic Dataset for Audio Processing*. ArXiv abs/2204.01787 (2022).

2. **3D-FRONT Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Huan Fu, Bowen Cai, Lin Gao, Ling-Xiao Zhang, Jiaming Wang, Cao Li, Qixun Zeng, Chengyue Sun, Rongfei Jia, Binqiang Zhao, et al. *3D-FRONT: 3D Furnished Rooms with Layouts and Semantics*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, 2021, pages 10933â€“10942.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
