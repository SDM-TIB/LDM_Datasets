To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AdvDiff: Generating Unrestricted Adversarial Examples using Diffusion Models" by Xuelong Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on **MNIST** and **ImageNet** datasets, indicating that these are the datasets used in their research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about the datasets. The introduction confirms that the authors are using **MNIST**, which consists of handwritten digits, and **ImageNet**, a large visual database with 1000 object classes. This reinforces the identification of the datasets.

I will then look at the **experiments** section, specifically where the authors describe their methodology and results. They mention using **MNIST** for evaluating low-quality robust image generation and **ImageNet** for high-quality generation tasks. This further confirms the datasets being utilized.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **MNIST**, the citation is:
   > Li Deng. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digit Images for Machine Learning Research [Best of the Web]*. IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 29(6):141–142, 2012.

2. For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248–255, 2009.

Having gathered this information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
