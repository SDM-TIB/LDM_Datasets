To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Siamese Learning on Stereo Image Pairs for Depth Estimation in Robotic Surgery" by M. Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, but I will focus on the sections that typically contain detailed information about datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for large image datasets with ground truth depths for training their models. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **materials and methods section** closely. Here, the authors mention that they trained their depth estimation networks on an **in vivo dataset collected during a partial nephrectomy procedure**. They specify that this dataset includes **20,000 stereo pairs of rectified images** sampled from **11 video sequences**. This is a key dataset for their experiments.

In the **results section**, they mention using a separate video sequence of **3000 stereo pairs of images** for testing. However, they do not provide a specific name for this testing dataset, indicating that it is part of their in vivo data collection.

Now, I will check the **references section** to see if any of the cited works correspond to publicly available datasets that could be relevant. However, the references primarily cite methods and frameworks rather than specific datasets.

Since the authors do not provide a formal citation for the in vivo dataset they used, I will note that it is an original dataset collected by the authors during their surgical procedures. Therefore, I will create a citation entry for this dataset based on the information provided in the paper.

The dataset details I will compile are as follows:

1. **In Vivo Surgical Dataset**: This dataset consists of 20,000 stereo pairs of rectified images collected during robotic partial nephrectomy procedures. The images are resized for efficient training.

For the citation, since the dataset is original and not publicly available, I will format it as follows:
> M. Ye, E. Johns, A. Handa, L. Zhang, P. Pratt, G.-Z. Yang. *In Vivo Surgical Dataset for Depth Estimation in Robotic Surgery*. Unpublished dataset, collected during robotic surgery procedures.

Now, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
