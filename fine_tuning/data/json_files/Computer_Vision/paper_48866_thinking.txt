To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Diversifying Semantic Image Synthesis and Editing via Class- and Layer-wise VAEs" by Yuki Endo and Yoshihiro Kanamori, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments with real and synthetic datasets in three different domains. This indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, I find the following datasets:

1. **ADE20K**: This dataset contains images of indoor and outdoor scenes labeled with 151 semantic classes, including various objects like windows, beds, and trees. The dataset consists of 20,210 training images and 2,000 validation images.

2. **DeepFashion**: This dataset is a fashion-image dataset with 16 semantic classes (e.g., tops, pants, hair). It includes 6,343 training images and 6,390 test images, with specific preprocessing steps mentioned.

3. **GTA-5**: This dataset includes rendered images of street scenes with greater variations in weather conditions and object appearances. It contains 12,403 training images and 6,382 test images, with 20 semantic classes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **ADE20K**, the citation is:
  > Zhou, Bolei, Zhao, Hang, Puig, Xavier, et al. "Scene Parsing through ADE20K Dataset." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017, pp. 5122–5130.

- For **DeepFashion**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Ziwei, Luo, Ping, Qiu, Shi, et al. "DeepFashion: Powering Robust Clothes Recognition and Retrieval with Rich Annotations." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

- For **GTA-5**, the citation is:
  > Richter, Stephan R., Vineet, Vibhav, Roth, Stefan, and Koltun, Vladlen. "Playing for Data: Ground Truth from Computer Games." In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2016, pp. 102–118.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
