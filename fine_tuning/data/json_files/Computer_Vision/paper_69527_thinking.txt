To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parallel-friendly Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning for Photovoltaic Degradation Analysis at Scale" by Yangxin Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on three large-scale PV datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their evaluations. They mention five datasets in total, categorized into three PV datasets and two real-world datasets from finance and economy:

1. **PV_Case1**: This dataset exhibits global linear degradation patterns and consists of 10-year power output timeseries from 100 inverters across 5 PV sites in Colorado, USA.

2. **PV_Case2**: This dataset shows a piecewise linear degradation pattern with a breakpoint at the second year, also comprising 10-year power output timeseries from 100 inverters in the same locations.

3. **PV_Case3**: This dataset exhibits a non-linear exponential degradation pattern, again with 10-year power output timeseries from 100 inverters in Colorado.

4. **Finance Dataset**: This dataset includes weekly stock prices of the 500 companies listed in the S&P 500 from December 13, 2018, to December 13, 2023.

5. **Economy Dataset**: This dataset contains the annual GDP (in current US dollars) of G20 countries over the past 50 years, sampled from 1973 to 2022.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific citations for the PV datasets, as they seem to be proprietary data from the authors' collaborations. However, I will provide citations for the finance and economy datasets based on common sources:

- For the **Finance Dataset**, a suitable citation could be:
  > Yahoo Finance. (2023). Historical Data for S&P 500. Retrieved from https://finance.yahoo.com/

- For the **Economy Dataset**, a suitable citation could be:
  > World Bank. (2023). GDP (current US$) - G20 countries. Retrieved from https://data.worldbank.org/

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
