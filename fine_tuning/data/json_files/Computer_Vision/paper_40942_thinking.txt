To extract datasets from the research paper titled "B-Spline CNNs on Lie Groups" by Erik J. Bekkers, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on "two benchmark datasets," which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the author discusses the datasets used for evaluation. In **Section 4.1**, the paper explicitly states that the **PCam dataset** is used for cancer detection in histopathology slides. It describes the dataset as consisting of 327,680 RGB patches taken from histopathologic scans, which are binary labeled for the presence of metastasis.

In **Section 4.2**, the paper mentions the **CelebA dataset**, which contains 202,599 RGB images of celebrities with various attributes and facial landmarks. The dataset is reformatted for the experiments, and specific details about the images and their annotations are provided.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **PCam dataset**, the citation is:
   > Bastiaan S. Veeling, Jasper Linmans, Jim Winkens, Taco Cohen, and Max Welling. *Rotation Equivariant CNNs for Digital Pathology*. In Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention – MICCAI 2018, pp. 210–218, Cham, 2018. Springer International Publishing. ISBN 978-3-030-00934-2.

2. For the **CelebA dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), December 2015.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **PCam dataset**: Used for cancer detection in histopathology slides, consisting of 327,680 RGB patches.
- **CelebA dataset**: Contains 202,599 RGB images of celebrities with various attributes and facial landmarks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant information is accurately captured for future reference or processing.
