To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reuse and Diffuse: Text-to-Video Generation" by Shicong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of multiple existing datasets for training their text-to-video generation model, which indicates that there are datasets to extract. The introduction further elaborates on the challenges of video synthesis and the need for high-quality video-text data, hinting at the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their strategies for composing video-text data from various existing datasets. They categorize the datasets into four types: well-captioned video-text datasets, short video classification datasets, long video classification datasets, and image datasets.

I will identify the specific datasets mentioned:

1. **Well-captioned video-text datasets**:
   - **WebVid-2M**: Contains about 2.5 million subtitled videos, but only those with a duration of less than 20 seconds are used.
   - **TGIF**: Comprises 100K GIFs collected from Tumblr.
   - **VATEX**: A large-scale dataset covering 600 fine-grained human activities.
   - **Pexels**: Contains approximately 360,000 well-captioned videos.

2. **Short video classification datasets**:
   - **Moments-In-Time**: Contains over one million videos covering 339 action categories.
   - **Kinetics-700**: Includes over 650,000 videos covering 700 human action categories.

3. **Long video classification datasets**:
   - **VideoLT**: Contains 250,000 untrimmed long videos covering 1004 categories.

4. **Image datasets**:
   - **LAION-5B**: Contains 5.58 billion image-text pairs, with a portion used to create pseudo-videos.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset. Here are the citations I will compile:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
