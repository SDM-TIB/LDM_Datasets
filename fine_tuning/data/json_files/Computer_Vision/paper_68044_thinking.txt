To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compact 3D Scene Representation via Self-Organizing Gaussian Grids" by Wieland Morgenstern et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section (Section 4)**, where the authors discuss their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention using three real-world 3D scene reconstruction datasets: **Mip-NeRF360**, **Tanks&Temples**, and **Deep Blending**, along with a synthetic dataset called **Synthetic-NeRF**. I will take note of these datasets and their descriptions.

In the **implementation details (Section 4.1)**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for their comparisons, which reinforces their relevance to the research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **Mip-NeRF360**: 
   > Barron, J. T., Mildenhall, B., Verbin, D., Srinivasan, P. P., & Hedman, P. (2022). Mip-NeRF 360: Unbounded anti-aliased neural radiance fields. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 5460â€“5469.

2. **Tanks&Temples**: 
   > (The citation for this dataset is not provided in the text, so I will need to look it up separately if necessary.)

3. **Deep Blending**: 
   > (The citation for this dataset is also not provided in the text, so I will need to look it up separately if necessary.)

4. **Synthetic-NeRF**: 
   > (The citation for this dataset is not provided in the text, so I will need to look it up separately if necessary.)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with proper attribution for each.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
