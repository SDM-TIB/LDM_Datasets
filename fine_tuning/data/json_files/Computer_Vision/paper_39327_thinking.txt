To extract datasets from the research paper titled "StereoDRNet: Dilated Residual Stereo Net" by Rohan Chabra et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on several stereo benchmarks, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4**, where the authors detail the datasets used for evaluation. In **section 4.1**, the authors explicitly mention the **SceneFlow Dataset**, describing it as a synthetic dataset with over 30,000 stereo pairs for training and around 4,000 stereo pairs for evaluation. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, and I will note its details.

In **section 4.2**, the authors discuss the **KITTI Datasets**, specifically KITTI 2012 and KITTI 2015. They describe these datasets as containing stereo pairs with semi-dense depth images acquired using a LIDAR sensor, which are used for training and evaluation. I will extract the relevant details about these datasets as well.

In **section 4.3**, the authors mention the **ETH3D Dataset**, which contains challenging scenes for depth estimation. I will also include this dataset in my extraction.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **SceneFlow Dataset**:
   > Nikolaus Mayer, Eddy Ilg, Philip Hausser, Philipp Fischer, Daniel Cremers, Alexey Dosovitskiy, and Thomas Brox. *A large dataset to train convolutional networks for disparity, optical flow, and scene flow estimation*.

2. **KITTI Dataset**:

3. **ETH3D Dataset**:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
