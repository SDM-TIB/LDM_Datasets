To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Open-Set Recognition of Breast Cancer Treatments" by Alexander Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the study's focus and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions that the study involves breast cancer patient data from Northwestern Memorial Hospital, which indicates that there is a dataset related to patient encounters.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** section. In this paper, the authors describe the dataset construction in **section 3.2 (Dataset construction)**. Here, they detail that the dataset consists of breast cancer patient records spanning from 2000 to 2015, which is crucial information.

The authors provide a summary of the drug cocktail classes in **Table 1**, which lists the specific drug cocktails, the number of encounters, and their FDA approval years. This table is essential for understanding the dataset's structure and content.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets used in their experiments or any additional datasets that may have been referenced during the analysis. However, the primary dataset appears to be the breast cancer patient records.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The primary dataset is the breast cancer patient records from Northwestern Memorial Hospital. Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for this dataset, I will create a citation based on the information provided in the paper:

- **Breast Cancer Patient Dataset**:
  > Cao, A., Klabjan, D., & Luo, Y. (2022). Open-Set Recognition of Breast Cancer Treatments. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2201.01022*.

This citation reflects the authors and the title of the paper where the dataset is discussed, as well as the arXiv identifier for reference.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the dataset details and citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference.
