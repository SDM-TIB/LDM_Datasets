To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Who Wins the Game of Thrones? How Sentiments Improve the Prediction of Candidate Choice" by Chaehan So, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study is based on a previous data collection of **7161 respondents** from a survey on **91 personality and 3 demographic items**. This suggests that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more specific details.

Next, I will focus on the **Method** section, particularly the subsection titled **Multidimensional Introversion-Extroversion Scales**. Here, the author mentions the **MIES dataset**, which was released on **19 Aug 2019** and contains **7188 questionnaire responses**. This dataset is crucial for the study as it includes the target variable (self-identification as introvert or extrovert) and various features.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MIES dataset. The paper references the **Open-Source Psychometric Project**, which is the source of the dataset. I will need to ensure that I provide a proper citation for this project.

The citation for the MIES dataset is:
> Open-Source Psychometric Project. *Multidimensional Introversion-Extraversion Scales (MIES)*. Available at: [https://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/](https://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/).

Now, I will summarize the dataset details:
1. **MIES Dataset**: Contains 7188 responses with 94 features (91 personality items and 3 demographic items). The dataset is used to classify individuals as introverts or extroverts based on their responses.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for any further processing or review.
