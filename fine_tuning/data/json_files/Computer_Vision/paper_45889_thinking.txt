To extract datasets from the dissertation titled "The Geometry of Distributed Representations for Better Alignment, Attenuated Bias, and Improved Interpretability" by Sunipa Dev, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned throughout the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. These sections often provide a summary of the key contributions and may mention specific datasets used in the research. For instance, the introduction discusses the use of word embeddings and their biases, which may lead to the identification of datasets related to word embeddings.

Next, I will look into the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections typically detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets mentioned, such as the Wikipedia dump for word embeddings or any other datasets used for bias evaluation.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** for any references to datasets that were analyzed or compared. This may include datasets used for measuring bias, such as the Stanford NLI corpus or datasets for evaluating word embeddings.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **appendices** where the author may have provided additional details about the datasets, including their sources, characteristics, and any specific configurations used in the experiments.

Once I have gathered the necessary information about each dataset, I will ensure to write down the full citations for each dataset as they appear in the references section of the dissertation. This is crucial for proper attribution and for others to locate the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes its name, description, and full citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the dissertation.
