To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NaRCan: Natural Refined Canonical Image with Integration of Diffusion Prior for Video Editing" by Ting-Hsuan Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. This is where the authors typically describe the datasets they used for training and evaluation. I will pay close attention to any specific names, characteristics, and the context in which these datasets are used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors may provide details about the datasets used for their evaluations, including the number of samples, types of data (e.g., video sequences, images), and any relevant metrics or benchmarks associated with these datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions the **BalanceCC dataset**, I will look for the citation that provides the authors, title, conference/journal, and year of publication. I will do this for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, making sure to include all relevant details for each dataset extracted from the paper.
