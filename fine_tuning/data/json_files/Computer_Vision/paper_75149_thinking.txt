To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Second Place Solution of WSDM2023 Toloka Visual Question Answering Challenge" by Xiangyu Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a large-scale synthetic dataset similar to the competition dataset, which suggests that there is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset they used. Here, they mention the **Toloka dataset**, which consists of images paired with textual questions and includes ground truth bounding box coordinates. The dataset contains a total of 45,199 instances, divided into training, public test, and private test sets.

The authors describe the structure of the dataset, noting that it includes columns for image URLs, questions, and bounding box annotations. This section provides essential details about the dataset's content and organization.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Toloka dataset**. However, it appears that the dataset is not attributed to a specific paper or source in the references provided. Since the dataset is constructed for the competition, I will note that it may not have a formal citation but is essential for the context of their work.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details as follows:

1. **Toloka Dataset**: A dataset comprising 45,199 instances of images paired with textual questions, annotated with bounding box coordinates. It includes 38,990 instances in the training set, 1,705 in the public test set, and 4,504 in the private test set.

Since the dataset does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is a competition dataset without a specific reference.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that I have captured all necessary details for the Toloka dataset.
