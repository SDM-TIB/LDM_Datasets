To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Amodal Ground Truth and Completion in the Wild" by Guanqi Zhan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the creation of an evaluation benchmark called **MP3D-Amodal**, which indicates that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (The MP3D-Amodal Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they describe the dataset's contents, including the number of annotated amodal ground truth masks and real images. They state that the dataset contains **12,724 annotated amodal ground truth masks over 10,883 real images**, which is crucial information for my extraction.

In addition, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference **COCOA** as another dataset used for comparison and evaluation. They discuss how their method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the **COCOA** dataset and their own **MP3D-Amodal** benchmark.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for both datasets:

1. For **MP3D-Amodal**, since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:
   > Zhan, G., Zheng, C., Xie, W., & Zisserman, A. (2023). Amodal Ground Truth and Completion in the Wild. *Visual Geometry Group, University of Oxford*. Available at: https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/amodal/

2. For **COCOA**, the citation is:
   > Zhu, Y., Tian, Y., Metaxas, D., & Dollar, P. (2017). Semantic amodal segmentation. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1464â€“1472.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
