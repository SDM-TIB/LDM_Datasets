To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Multipath Graph Convolutional Neural Networks" by Rangan Das et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their model on various benchmark datasets for node property prediction, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors mention using "seven common graph datasets" for evaluation. I will look for a table or a list that explicitly names these datasets. In this case, Table 1 provides a comparison of performance on node property prediction tasks, which likely includes the datasets used.

Upon examining Table 1, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **AmazonCoBuy (Computer)**: This dataset is used for node property prediction tasks.
2. **AmazonCoBuy (Photo)**: Another dataset from the AmazonCoBuy collection, also for node property prediction.
3. **CiteSeer**: A well-known citation network dataset.
4. **Coauthor (Computer Science)**: A dataset representing co-authorship relationships in computer science.
5. **CoraFull**: A comprehensive dataset for citation networks.
6. **CoraGraph**: A variant of the Cora dataset.
7. **Reddit**: A dataset derived from the Reddit social network.

Additionally, the authors mention testing on two Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) datasets, which are:

8. **ogb-arxiv**: A dataset from the Open Graph Benchmark focused on arXiv papers.
9. **ogbn-proteins**: Another dataset from the OGB, related to protein structures.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured both the dataset names and their corresponding citations.
