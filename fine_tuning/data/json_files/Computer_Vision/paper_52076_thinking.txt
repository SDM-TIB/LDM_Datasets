To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-task Deep Learning for Cerebrovascular Disease Classification and MRI-to-PET Translation" by Ramy Hussein et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and materials and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals, and the introduction often highlights the significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of accurate quantification of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and mention the use of MRI and PET imaging. However, I need to look for specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the **dataset subsection**. Here, the authors describe the dataset used for their study. They mention that the study is retrospective and includes data from **120 subjects** (60 healthy controls and 60 cerebrovascular disease patients). The dataset comprises various MRI scans, including T1-weighted, T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and arterial spin labeling images, as well as PET CBF maps.

The authors also specify that the dataset includes:
- **52 patients with Moyamoya disease**
- **4 patients with intracranial atherosclerotic steno-occlusive disease (ICSD)**
- **4 patients with stroke**

Additionally, they mention that the total number of scans is **332**, which includes scans before and after acetazolamide administration.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or related studies mentioned. The authors refer to a study for the gold standard PET CBF measurements, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

The relevant citation for the PET CBF measurement is:
> Khalighi, M. M., Deller, T. W., Fan, A. P., Gulaka, P. K., Shen, B., Singh, P., Park, J.-H., Chin, F. T., & Zaharchuk, G. (2018). Image-derived input function estimation on a TOF-enabled PET/MR for cerebral blood flow mapping. *Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism*, 38(1), 126-135.

Now, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

1. **Dataset of 120 subjects** (60 healthy controls and 60 cerebrovascular disease patients):
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided in the paper, but the study is based on data collected at Stanford University.

2. **Gold standard PET CBF measurements**:
   - Citation: Khalighi, M. M., Deller, T. W., Fan, A. P., Gulaka, P. K., Shen, B., Singh, P., Park, J.-H., Chin, F. T., & Zaharchuk, G. (2018). Image-derived input function estimation on a TOF-enabled PET/MR for cerebral blood flow mapping. *Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism*, 38(1), 126-135.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
