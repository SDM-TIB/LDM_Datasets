To extract datasets from the research paper titled "StyleTTS 2: Towards Human-Level Text-to-Speech through Style Diffusion and Adversarial Training with Large Speech Language Models" by Yinghao Aaron Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their model on several datasets, which suggests that I should find specific names and details.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention achieving human-level performance on the **LJSpeech** and **VCTK** datasets. This is a strong indication that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **LJSpeech Dataset**: This dataset consists of 13,100 short audio clips totaling approximately 24 hours of speech. The authors specify that it is divided into training, validation, and testing sets.

2. **VCTK Dataset**: This dataset includes nearly 44,000 short clips from 109 native speakers with various accents. The authors also mention the data split used for training, validation, and testing.

3. **LibriTTS Dataset**: This dataset is used for zero-shot speaker adaptation and contains about 245 hours of audio from 1,151 speakers. The authors provide details about the filtering of utterances based on length and the distribution of the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **LJSpeech Dataset**:
  > Keith Ito and Linda Johnson. *The LJ Speech Dataset*. Available at: https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/, 2017.

- **VCTK Dataset**:
  > Junichi Yamagishi, Christophe Veaux, Kirsten MacDonald, et al. *CSTR VCTK Corpus: English Multi-Speaker Corpus for CSTR Voice Cloning Toolkit (version 0.92)*, 2019.

- **LibriTTS Dataset**:
  > Heiga Zen, Viet Dang, Rob Clark, Yu Zhang, Ron J Weiss, Ye Jia, Zhifeng Chen, and Yonghui Wu. *LibriTTS: A Corpus Derived from LibriSpeech for Text-to-Speech*. Proc. Interspeech 2019, pages 1526â€“1530, 2019.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further use.
