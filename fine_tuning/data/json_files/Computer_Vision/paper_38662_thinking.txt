To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-resolution neural networks for tracking seismic horizons from few training images" by Bas Peters et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention the datasets used for validation or testing.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss previous work and the datasets that have been utilized in related studies. This section may provide context for the datasets used in their own research.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors describe their approach to horizon detection and may specify the datasets used for training and evaluation.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using seismic images from sedimentary areas in the North Sea and the Sea of Ireland for their experiments. However, they do not provide specific dataset names or citations in the main text.

To ensure I have the correct references, I will consult the **References section** of the paper. Here, I will look for any citations that correspond to the datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to datasets from other studies, I will extract the full citations for those datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will compile the information, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as follows:

1. **North Sea Seismic Dataset**: This dataset consists of seismic images used for horizon detection in sedimentary areas. The authors do not provide a specific citation, so I will note that it is derived from their own research or an industrial partner.

2. **Sea of Ireland Seismic Dataset**: Similar to the North Sea dataset, this dataset is used for horizon detection and is mentioned in the context of their experiments. Again, I will note that a specific citation is not provided.

If the authors reference any specific papers or datasets in the references that are relevant to the datasets they used, I will include those citations as well.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation, even if it is a general reference to the seismic data used in their study.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, along with their full citations.
