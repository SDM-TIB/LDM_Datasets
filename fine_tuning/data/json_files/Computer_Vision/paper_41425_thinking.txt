To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Armed Bandits with Correlated Arms" by Samarth Gupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their algorithms using the **MovieLens** and **Goodreads** datasets, which suggests these are the primary datasets of interest.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. Here, the authors describe the **MovieLens dataset** as containing 1 million ratings for 3883 movies rated by 6040 users, and the **Goodreads dataset** as containing ratings for 1,561,465 books by 808,749 users. This information is crucial for understanding the context in which the datasets were used.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For the **MovieLens dataset**, the citation is:
> Harper, F. M., & Konstan, J. A. (2015). The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context. *ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS)*, 5(4), Article 19.

For the **Goodreads dataset**, the citation is:
> Wan, M., & McAuley, J. (2018). Item Recommendation on Monotonic Behavior Chains. In *Proceedings of the 12th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems* (pp. 86-94). ACM.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

In summary, the steps I will take are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify datasets.
2. Review the experiments section for detailed descriptions.
3. Locate full citations in the references section.
4. Compile the dataset information for structured output.

This methodical approach will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
