To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Shape Prior Deformation for Categorical 6D Object Pose and Size Estimation" by Meng Tian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two datasets:

1. **CAMERA Dataset**: This dataset is generated by rendering and composing synthetic objects into real scenes. It contains 300,000 composite images, with 25,000 set aside for evaluation. The training set includes 1,085 object instances from six categories: bottle, bowl, camera, can, laptop, and mug.

2. **REAL Dataset**: This dataset captures 4,300 real-world images across seven scenes for training and 2,750 real-world images for evaluation. It includes 18 real objects spanning the same six categories as the CAMERA dataset.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The CAMERA and REAL datasets are referenced as follows:

- For the **CAMERA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, H., Sridhar, S., Huang, J., Valentin, J., Song, S., Guibas, L.J. *Normalized Object Coordinate Space for Category-Level 6D Object Pose and Size Estimation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 2642â€“2651, 2019.

- For the **REAL Dataset**, the citation is the same as above, as it is a complementary dataset to the CAMERA dataset.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will allow for clear documentation of the datasets used in the research.
