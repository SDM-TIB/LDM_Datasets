To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dirichlet Flow Matching with Applications to DNA Sequence Design" by Hannes Stark et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on three DNA sequence datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In **Section 4.2 (Promoter DNA sequence design)**, the authors mention using a dataset of **100,000 promoter sequences** with 1,024 base pairs extracted from a database of human promoters. This is a clear dataset description.

In **Section 4.3 (Enhancer DNA design)**, the authors refer to two enhancer sequence datasets: one from **fly brain cells** and another from **human melanoma cells**. They specify that the fly brain dataset contains **104,665 sequences** and the melanoma dataset contains **88,870 sequences**. This provides a clear indication of the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. For the **promoter sequences**, the citation is:
   > Hon, C.-C., Ramilowski, J. A., Harshbarger, J., et al. (2017). *An atlas of human long non-coding RNAs with accurate 5 ends*. Nature.

2. For the **fly brain enhancer dataset**, the citation is:
   > Janssens, J., Aibar, S., Taskiran, I. I., et al. (2022). *Decoding gene regulation in the fly brain*. Nature.

3. For the **human melanoma enhancer dataset**, the citation is:
   > Atak, Z. K., Taskiran, I. I., Demeulemeester, J., et al. (2021). *Interpretation of allele-specific chromatin accessibility using cell state-aware deep learning*. Genome Research.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Promoter DNA sequences**: 100,000 sequences, 1,024 base pairs, from human promoters.
- **Fly brain enhancer dataset**: 104,665 sequences, from fly brain cells.
- **Human melanoma enhancer dataset**: 88,870 sequences, from human melanoma cells.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly attributed. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or citations.
