To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Toward Tiny and High-quality Facial Makeup with Data Amplify Learning" by Qiaoqiao Jin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a new learning paradigm and mentions the use of limited images for training, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they state that they randomly selected **5 images without makeup from the Flickr-Faces-HQ (FFHQ) dataset** as data seeds for their Data Amplify Learning (DAL) approach. They also mention that they used **100 images from the FFHQ dataset** and **100 images from the MT dataset** for evaluation.

Now, I will look for the full citations of these datasets in the **References section** of the paper:

1. **Flickr-Faces-HQ (FFHQ) Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Karras, T., Laine, S., & Aila, T. (2019). *A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 4401–4410.

2. **MT Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Li, T., Qian, R., Dong, C., Liu, S., Yan, Q., Zhu, W., & Lin, L. (2018). *BeautyGAN: Instance-level facial makeup transfer with deep generative adversarial network*. In Proceedings of the 2018 ACM Multimedia Conference on Multimedia Conference (MM), pages 645–653.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Flickr-Faces-HQ (FFHQ) Dataset**: This dataset consists of high-quality images of human faces, which are used as data seeds for the DAL approach.
2. **MT Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method in terms of makeup transfer.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included for reference. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
