To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Obstacles in Fully Automatic Program Repair: A Survey" by S. Amirhossein Mousavi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction discusses various aspects of automatic program repair but does not provide specific dataset names either.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and discussion sections** for any references to datasets used in the research. I will look for mentions of specific datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the context of the study. If the authors refer to datasets used in previous studies or experiments, I will note those down.

As I read through the paper, I will pay particular attention to any **figures, tables, or references** that might indicate the use of datasets. For example, if the authors cite specific datasets in their experiments or comparisons, I will extract that information.

After identifying any datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

If I find datasets, I will ensure to document the following for each:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics.
3. The full citation for the dataset as it appears in the references section of the paper.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete.

By following these steps, I will be able to effectively extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a clear and comprehensive overview of the data used in the research.
