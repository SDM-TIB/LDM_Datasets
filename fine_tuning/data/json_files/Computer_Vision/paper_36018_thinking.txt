To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Chronic Disease Hospitalizations from Electronic Health Records: An Interpretable Classification Approach" by Theodora S. Brisimi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their algorithms on large datasets from the Boston Medical Center, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (The Data)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **Heart Dataset**: This dataset includes patients with at least one heart-related diagnosis or procedure record from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2010. It consists of 45,579 patients, with 3,033 labeled as hospitalized in a target year.

2. **Diabetes Dataset**: This dataset includes patients with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2012. It consists of 33,122 patients, with 5,622 labeled as hospitalized in a target year.

In the same section, the authors provide details about how the data was collected and processed, which is crucial for understanding the context of the datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are derived from the Boston Medical Center's records, they may not have formal citations like published datasets. Instead, I will note that the datasets are based on internal records from the Boston Medical Center.

To summarize, I will create entries for each dataset as follows:

- For the **Heart Dataset**:
  - Description: Patients with heart-related diagnoses or procedures from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2010.
  - Size: 45,579 patients, with 3,033 labeled as hospitalized.
  - Citation: Data sourced from the Boston Medical Center.

- For the **Diabetes Dataset**:
  - Description: Patients with diabetes mellitus diagnoses from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2012.
  - Size: 33,122 patients, with 5,622 labeled as hospitalized.
  - Citation: Data sourced from the Boston Medical Center.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
