To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Skin feature tracking using deep feature encodings" by Jose Ramon Chang and Torbjörn E. M. Nordling, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset for training the autoencoder and validation datasets for testing the algorithms, which indicates that there are specific datasets to look for.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various applications of facial imagery datasets and mention the need for deep learning in feature tracking. This suggests that they may refer to specific datasets later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that describe the datasets used for training and validation. Here, I find two key datasets mentioned:

1. **UTKFace Dataset**: This dataset is used to train the autoencoder. It consists of 24,108 face images with annotations for age, gender, and ethnicity. The authors describe how they processed the images for their experiments.

2. **Remote Ballistocardiography Dataset**: This dataset is used for testing the algorithms in a specific application. It includes videos recorded under two motion conditions (static and bike) to estimate heart rate from facial movements.

3. **Parkinson’s Disease Postural Tremor Test Dataset**: This dataset is used to evaluate the generalizability of the method for tracking skin features outside the face. It consists of videos of hands of patients with Parkinson's disease.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **UTKFace Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, K., Zhang, Z., Li, Z., & Qiao, Y. (2017). *Age progression/regression by conditional adversarial autoencoder*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For the **Remote Ballistocardiography Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, C.-C. (2020). *Non-contact heart rate measurement based on facial videos*. Master’s thesis, National Cheng Kung University.

- For the **Parkinson’s Disease Postural Tremor Test Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ashyani, A., Lin, C.-L., Roman, E., Yeh, T., Kuo, T., Tsai, W.-F., et al. (2022). *Digitization of UPDRS upper limb motor examinations towards automated quantification of symptoms of Parkinson’s disease*. Manuscript in preparation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
