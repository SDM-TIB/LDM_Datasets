To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DECIG: Device Efficient Conditional Image Generation" by Nisarg A. Shah and Gaurav Bharaj, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any mention of datasets used for evaluation or training.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and results sections**. In these sections, the authors typically describe the experiments conducted and the datasets used. For instance, in the results section, the authors mention using the **CelebA-HQ dataset** for their experiments, which contains 30,000 high-quality face images and corresponding pixel-level segmentation masks. This is a key dataset for their work.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The CelebA-HQ dataset is referenced in the paper, and I will ensure to extract the complete citation for it.

The citation for the **CelebA-HQ dataset** is:
> Shen, Y., Liu, Z., Wu, L., & Luo, P. (2020). MaskGAN: Towards Diverse and Interactive Facial Image Manipulation. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper, such as those used for training or comparison purposes. If the authors refer to any other datasets, I will document them in a similar manner, ensuring to include their full citations.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately extracting and documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
