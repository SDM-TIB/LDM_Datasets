To extract datasets from the research paper titled "REST: Retrieve & Self-Train for Generative Action Recognition" by Adrian Bulat et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on a generative action/video recognition model, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **methodology** section, particularly focusing on the parts where the authors describe their experiments and the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention training their model on the **Kinetics-400 dataset** without using any labels. This is a significant dataset in the context of action recognition.

I will also check the **results** section to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned, especially in the context of evaluation. The authors refer to testing on **HMDB-51**, **UCF-101**, and **Kinetics-600** datasets, which are commonly used benchmarks for action recognition tasks.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Kinetics-400**:
   > Kay, W., Carreira, J., Simonyan, K., Zhang, Z., Hillier, C., Vijayanarasimhan, S., ... & Zisserman, A. (2017). *The Kinetics human action video dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.06950.

2. **HMDB-51**:
   > Kuehne, H., Jhuang, H., Garrote, E., Poggio, T., & Serre, T. (2011). *HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2556â€“2563.

3. **UCF-101**:
   > Soomro, K., Zamir, A. R., & Shah, M. (2012). *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402.

4. **Kinetics-600**:
   > Carreira, J., Noland, E., Banki-Horvath, A., Hillier, C., & Zisserman, A. (2018). *A short note about kinetics-600*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1808.01340.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
