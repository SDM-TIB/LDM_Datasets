To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Task-oriented Explainable Semantic Communications" by Shuai Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using two standard datasets: **MNIST Dataset** and **CelebA Dataset**. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their purpose, size, and any relevant characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

For the **CelebA Dataset**, the citation is:
> Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3730â€“3738, 2015. [Online]. Available: http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.cn/projects/CelebA.html

Now that I have the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's details and citations.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, providing a clear reference for future research and applications.
