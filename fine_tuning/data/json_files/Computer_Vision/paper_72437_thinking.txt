To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SERPENT-VLM: Self-Refining Radiology Report Generation Using Vision Language Models" by Manav Nitin Kapadnis et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on two datasets: **IU X-Ray** and **ROCO**. This is a strong indication that these datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Evaluation)**, where the authors provide specific details about the datasets used. In this section, they describe:

1. **IU X-Ray**: This dataset is noted as a widely used public dataset for medical report generation tasks, containing 3,955 fully de-identified radiology reports associated with frontal and/or lateral chest X-rays, totaling 7,470 images.

2. **ROCO**: This dataset consists of synthetic radiology images and clinical photos, with a total of roughly 65,460 images in the 'radiology' subset and 8,182 images in the test set. The authors provide a breakdown of the dataset, indicating the number of images in both the training and testing phases.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. However, the datasets mentioned (IU X-Ray and ROCO) are commonly known datasets in the field of medical imaging, and their citations can be found in the literature. 

For **IU X-Ray**, the citation is:

For **ROCO**, the citation is:

Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that I have accurately captured the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations.
