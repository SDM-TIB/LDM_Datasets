To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Diffusion Model for Simulation Ready Coronary Anatomy with Morpho-skeletal Control" by Karim Kadry et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the study's objectives and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions the use of **62 Coronary Computed Tomography (CCTA) images** from patients with coronary artery disease, indicating that this is a primary dataset for the study.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used in their experiments. Here, they specify that the dataset comprises **62 CCTA images**, from which **222 unique 3D segmentation map patches** were extracted. Each segmentation map contains various anatomical features, including lumen, vessel wall, and diseased calcified tissue.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as coming from the **Precise Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Plan (P3) Study**. However, they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset in the references, which is common for proprietary or internal datasets.

To summarize the findings, I will note the following dataset details:

1. **CCTA Dataset**: This dataset consists of 62 Coronary Computed Tomography images from patients with coronary artery disease. It is used to extract 3D segmentation maps for the study.

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset, I will include the study's name and context in my documentation.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and any relevant citations or references as needed. This will ensure that the dataset extraction is complete and ready for further processing or review.
