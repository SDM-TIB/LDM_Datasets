To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Domain Invariant Prompt for Vision-Language Models" by Cairong Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on **11 datasets for base-to-new generalization and 4 datasets for domain generalization**. This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors detail the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they specify the datasets for both generalization tasks:

1. **Base-to-New Generalization Datasets**: The paper lists 11 datasets, including:
   - **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset for image classification.
   - **Caltech101**: A dataset containing images of 101 object categories.
   - **OxfordPets**: A dataset for classifying images of cats and dogs.
   - **StanfordCars**: A dataset for fine-grained classification of car models.
   - **Flowers102**: A dataset for classifying images of flowers.
   - **Food101**: A dataset containing images of food items.
   - **FGVCAircraft**: A dataset for fine-grained classification of aircraft.
   - **SUN397**: A dataset for scene recognition.
   - **UCF101**: A dataset for action recognition.
   - **DTD**: A dataset for texture classification.
   - **EuroSAT**: A dataset for satellite imagery classification.

2. **Domain Generalization Datasets**: The paper mentions 4 datasets used for domain generalization:
   - **VLCS**: A dataset that includes images from four domains: VOC, LabelMe, Caltech101, and SUN.
   - **PACS**: A dataset containing images from four domains: Photo, Art Painting, Cartoon, and Sketch.
   - **OfficeHome**: A dataset with images from four domains: Art, Clipart, Product, and Real World.
   - **DomainNet**: A large-scale dataset with six domains: Clipart, Infograph, Painting, Quickdraw, Real, and Sketch.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. Here are the citations I will extract:
