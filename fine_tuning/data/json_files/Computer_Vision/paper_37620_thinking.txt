To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Latent Space Autoregression for Novelty Detection" by Davide Abati et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on publicly available datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) in detail, as this is where datasets are typically discussed. In section 4.1, the authors mention using the **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10** datasets for one-class novelty detection. They describe the experimental setup and how these datasets were utilized, which confirms their relevance.

In section 4.2, the authors refer to two additional datasets for video anomaly detection: **UCSD Ped2** and **ShanghaiTech**. They provide details about how these datasets were processed and evaluated in their experiments.

In section 4.4, the authors mention the **DR(eye)VE** dataset, which is used to model human attentional behavior in driving contexts. This dataset is also described in terms of its content and purpose.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper by consulting the **References section**:

1. **MNIST Dataset**:

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
