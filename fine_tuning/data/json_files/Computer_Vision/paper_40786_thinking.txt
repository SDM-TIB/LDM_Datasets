To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "ArduCode: Predictive Framework for Automation Engineering" by Arquimedes Canedo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their architecture on two real datasets consisting of **2,927 Arduino projects** and **683 Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) projects**. This is a clear indication that I need to focus on these two datasets.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions in the **data collection section**. In this section, the authors provide specific information about each dataset:

1. **Arduino Code Dataset**: This dataset includes the source code and textual metadata from **2,927 Arduino projects** sourced from the Arduino Project Hub. The metadata consists of project categories, titles, abstracts, tags, descriptions, and hardware configurations. The authors also mention that they curated the hardware configuration lists to standardize component names.

2. **PLC Code Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the OSCAT library, which is the largest publicly available library of PLC programs. It contains **683 functions** categorized into 28 labels. The authors note that the OSCAT library is vendor-independent and provides reusable code functions across various categories.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Arduino Code Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Arduino Project Hub. "Arduino Project Hub." https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub, 2020.

- For the **PLC Code Dataset**, the citation is:
  > OSCAT. "Open Source Community for Automation Technology." http://www.oscat.de/, 2020.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Arduino Code Dataset**: Contains 2,927 Arduino projects with extensive metadata.
   - Citation: Arduino Project Hub. "Arduino Project Hub." https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub, 2020.

2. **PLC Code Dataset**: Comprises 683 functions from the OSCAT library, categorized into 28 labels.
   - Citation: OSCAT. "Open Source Community for Automation Technology." http://www.oscat.de/, 2020.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
