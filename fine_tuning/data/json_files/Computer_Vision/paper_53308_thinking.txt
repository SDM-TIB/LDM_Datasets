To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GTNet: A Tree-Based Deep Graph Learning Architecture" by Nan Wu and Chaofan Wang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on several popular benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section V)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention working on semi-supervised node classification tasks with four popular benchmark datasets: **Cora, Citeseer, PubMed, and Coauthor-CS**, as well as one OGB dataset: **ogbn-arxiv**. I will extract the relevant details about each dataset, including their characteristics and statistics, which are summarized in **Table I**.

The details for each dataset are as follows:

1. **Cora**: 
   - Number of Nodes: 2708
   - Number of Edges: 10556
   - Number of Features/Node: 1433
   - Number of Classes: 7
   - Label Rate: 5.2%
   - Number of Training Nodes: 500
   - Number of Validation Nodes: 1000

2. **Citeseer**: 
   - Number of Nodes: 3327
   - Number of Edges: 9228
   - Number of Features/Node: 3703
   - Number of Classes: 6
   - Label Rate: 3.6%
   - Number of Training Nodes: 500
   - Number of Validation Nodes: 1000

3. **PubMed**: 
   - Number of Nodes: 19717
   - Number of Edges: 88651
   - Number of Features/Node: 500
   - Number of Classes: 3
   - Label Rate: 0.3%
   - Number of Training Nodes: 500
   - Number of Validation Nodes: 1000

4. **Coauthor-CS**: 
   - Number of Nodes: 18333
   - Number of Edges: 81894
   - Number of Features/Node: 6805
   - Number of Classes: 15
   - Label Rate: 1.6%
   - Number of Training Nodes: 20/class
   - Number of Validation Nodes: 30/class

5. **ogbn-arxiv**: 
   - Number of Nodes: 169343
   - Number of Edges: 1166243
   - Number of Features/Node: 128
   - Number of Classes: 40
   - Label Rate: 53.7%
   - Number of Training Nodes: 90941
   - Number of Validation Nodes: 29799
   - Number of Test Nodes: 48603

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for each dataset.
