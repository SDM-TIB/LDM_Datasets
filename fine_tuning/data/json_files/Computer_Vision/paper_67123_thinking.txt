To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VideoSwap: Customized Video Subject Swapping with Interactive Semantic Point Correspondence" by Yuchao Gu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the VideoSwap framework and its capabilities but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. I will look for any references to datasets used for evaluation or training. In this paper, the authors mention collecting videos from **Shutterstock and DAVIS** for their experiments. This indicates that these are the datasets used in their work.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The references may not provide specific dataset citations directly, so I will need to look for the original sources of the datasets mentioned:

1. **Shutterstock**: This is a commercial stock photo and video service. While it may not have a formal citation like a research paper, I can note it as a source of video content used in the experiments.

2. **DAVIS Dataset**: The authors mention using the DAVIS dataset, which is a well-known dataset for video object segmentation. The citation for the DAVIS dataset is:
   > Perazzi, F., Pont-Tuset, J., McWilliams, B., Van Gool, L., Gross, M., & Sorkine-Hornung, A. (2016). *A benchmark dataset and evaluation methodology for video object segmentation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 724â€“732.

After identifying these datasets, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations for potential downstream processing or review.
