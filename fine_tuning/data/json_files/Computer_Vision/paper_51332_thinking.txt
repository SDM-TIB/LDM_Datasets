To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepFIB: Self-Imputation for Time Series Anomaly Detection" by Minhao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on various real-world time series datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors provide a table (Table 1) listing the datasets used in their experiments. This table includes the names of the datasets, their dimensions, training and testing sizes, and the percentage of anomalies present in each dataset. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **2d-gesture**
2. **Power demand**
3. **ECG (A-F)**
4. **Credit Card**

I will then look for any additional details about these datasets in the text surrounding the table, particularly in the **experiments** section, where the authors discuss the characteristics of the datasets and the models used for each.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets in the table, so I will need to look for the original sources of these datasets in the literature. 

For example, I know that:
- The **2d-gesture dataset** is commonly referenced in anomaly detection literature, and I can find its citation in related works.
- The **Power demand dataset** is often used in time series analysis and can also be found in previous studies.
- The **ECG datasets** (A-F) are well-known in the medical domain, and I can find their citations in relevant medical research papers.
- The **Credit Card dataset** is frequently used in fraud detection studies, and I can locate its citation in the literature.

Once I have gathered the necessary citations, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all citations are complete and correctly formatted.
