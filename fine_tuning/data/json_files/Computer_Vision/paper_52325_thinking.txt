To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TCTrack: Temporal Contexts for Aerial Tracking" by Ziang Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the framework is evaluated on **four aerial tracking benchmarks**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors detail their evaluations. In **section 4.1**, they explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **UAV123**: This dataset is described as a large-scale aerial tracking benchmark involving 123 challenging sequences with more than 112K frames. It is used to verify tracking performance under common aerial conditions.

2. **UAVTrack112 L**: This dataset is noted as the largest long-term aerial tracking benchmark, including over 60K frames. It is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in long-term tracking scenarios.

3. **UAV123@10fps**: This dataset is a variant of UAV123, where the image rate is set to 10 FPS, making the tracking conditions more challenging due to abrupt motion and variations.

4. **DTB70**: This dataset includes 70 severe motion scenarios in various challenging scenes, used to evaluate the robustness of the proposed method.

In the **references section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **UAV123**, the citation is:
  > Matthias Mueller, Neil Smith, and Bernard Ghanem. *A Benchmark and Simulator for UAV Tracking*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 445–461, 2016.

- For **UAVTrack112 L**, the citation is:
  > Changhong Fu, Ziang Cao, Yiming Li, Junjie Ye, and Chen Feng. *Onboard Real-Time Aerial Tracking With Efficient Siamese Anchor Proposal Network*. IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, pages 1–13, 2021.

- For **UAV123@10fps**, the citation is:
  > Matthias Mueller, Neil Smith, and Bernard Ghanem. *A Benchmark and Simulator for UAV Tracking*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 445–461, 2016. (Note: This is the same as UAV123, as it is a variant of the same dataset.)

- For **DTB70**, the citation is:
  > Siyi Li and Dit-Yan Yeung. *Visual Object Tracking for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: A Benchmark and New Motion Models*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pages 1–7, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
