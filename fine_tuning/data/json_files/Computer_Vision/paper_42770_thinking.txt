To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning a Probabilistic Strategy for Computational Imaging Sensor Selection" by He Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Case Study: VLBI Array Design)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for the experiments. In this section, the authors discuss the Very-Long-Baseline-Interferometry (VLBI) array design problem and mention specific datasets related to telescope sites and their characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors refer to the **"Fashion-MNIST" dataset** for training their models. This dataset is commonly used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms, particularly in image classification tasks.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the "Fashion-MNIST" dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Xiao, H., Rasul, K., & Vollgraf, R. (2017). *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747.

Additionally, the paper discusses the **EHT+ array** and its telescope sites, which are part of the experimental setup. However, these sites are not datasets in the traditional sense but rather locations used in the study. Therefore, I will focus on the "Fashion-MNIST" dataset as the primary dataset extracted from the paper.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation for the "Fashion-MNIST" dataset as required. This will provide a clear and concise summary of the dataset used in the research.
