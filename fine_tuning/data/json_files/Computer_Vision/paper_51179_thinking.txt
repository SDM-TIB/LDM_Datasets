To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structure-Aware Multi-Hop Graph Convolution for Graph Neural Networks" by Yang Li and Yuichi Tanaka, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methods and results, while the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they propose graph neural networks (GNNs) for classifying nodes in 3D point clouds and citation networks. This suggests that datasets related to these applications may be included.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments on two specific datasets:

1. **ModelNet**: This dataset is used for 3D point cloud classification. The authors mention that ModelNet40 contains 12,308 CAD models in 40 categories, with specific splits for training and testing.

2. **Cora**: This dataset is used for node classification in citation networks. The authors describe it as containing 2,708 nodes and 5,429 edges, with seven categories of node labels.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

- For **ModelNet**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Z., Song, S., Khosla, A., Yu, F., Zhang, L., Tang, X., & Xiao, J. (2015). *3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE CVPR, 1912-1920.

- For **Cora**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). *Collective Classification in Network Data*. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-93.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a clear understanding of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the study.
