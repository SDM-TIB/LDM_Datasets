To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ink Marker Segmentation in Histopathology Images Using Deep Learning" by Danial Maleki et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves a dataset created from 79 whole slide images with 4,305 patches, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail, particularly the **experiments** section, where the authors describe the dataset used for training their models. In this case, they mention that they selected 89 ink-marked TCGA slides for their experiments, which is crucial information.

I will also check the **methodology** section to see if there are any additional details about how the dataset was constructed or any other datasets that might be referenced. The authors mention that the ground truth masks for the selected slides were created manually, which adds context to the dataset's creation.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The key datasets identified are:

1. **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)**: This is a well-known dataset in the field of cancer research. The citation for TCGA is:
   > Tomczak, K., Czerwi≈Ñska, P., & Wiznerowicz, M. (2015). The cancer genome atlas (tcga): an immeasurable source of knowledge. *Contemporary oncology*, 19(1A), A68.

2. The dataset created by the authors from 79 whole slide images is not a publicly available dataset with a formal citation, but I will note it as a custom dataset created for this study.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Dataset 1**: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
- **Dataset 2**: Custom dataset created from 79 whole slide images with 4,305 patches.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or analysis.
