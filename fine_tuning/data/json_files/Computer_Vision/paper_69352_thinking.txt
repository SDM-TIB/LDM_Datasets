To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cortical Surface Diffusion Generative Models" by Zhenshan Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of the **developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP)** for validation, which indicates that this is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **method** section, particularly the **Data** subsection, which provides more details about the dataset. Here, the authors specify that they used data from the dHCP, which consists of cortical surface meshes and metrics derived from T1- and T2-weighted MRI scans. They mention using **530 scans** from both term and preterm neonates, which gives me a clearer understanding of the dataset's scope.

In the **experiments and results** section, the authors validate their model using the dHCP dataset, reinforcing its significance in their study. This section does not introduce any new datasets, so I will focus on the dHCP dataset for extraction.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dHCP dataset. The relevant reference is:

- For the **developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP)**, the citation is:
  > Antonios Makropoulos, Emma C. Robinson, Andreas Schuh, Robert Wright, Sean Fitzgibbon, Jelena Bozek, Serena J. Counsell, Johannes Steinweg, Katerina Vecchiato, Jonathan Passerat-Palmbach, Gabriel Lenz, Filippo Mortari, Tihomir Tenev, Eugene P. Duff, Matteo Bastiani, Lucilio Cordero-Grande, Emer Hughes, Nora Tusor, J. Donald Tournier, Jana Hutter, Anthony N. Price, Rui Pedro A. G. Teixeira, Maria Murgasova, Sarah Victor, Christopher Kelly, Mary A. Rutherford, Stephen M. Smith, A. David Edwards, Joseph V. Hajnal, Mark Jenkinson, and Daniel Rueckert. *The developing human connectome project: A minimal processing pipeline for neonatal cortical surface reconstruction*. Neuroimage, vol. 173, pp. 88â€“112, 2018.

Having gathered all necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry for the dHCP dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will allow for proper referencing and acknowledgment of the dataset used in the research.
