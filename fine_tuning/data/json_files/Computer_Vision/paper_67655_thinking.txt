To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Faster Image Reconstruction with Latent Masking Diffusion" by Zhiyuan Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on two datasets: **ImageNet-1K** and **LSUN-Bedrooms**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for understanding the performance of the proposed model.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they pre-train their model on **ImageNet-1K** and **LSUN-Bedrooms**. They also mention the metrics used for evaluation, which reinforces the importance of these datasets in their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **ImageNet-1K**: The citation is:
   > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In CVPR, 248â€“255.

2. **LSUN-Bedrooms**: The citation is:
   > Yu, F., Seff, A., Zhang, Y., Song, S., Funkhouser, T., & Xiao, J. (2015). *Lsun: Construction of a large-scale image dataset using deep learning with humans in the loop*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.03365.

After confirming the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I will ensure that I have accurately identified the datasets used in the research, along with their full citations, to maintain the integrity and traceability of the data sources utilized in the study.
