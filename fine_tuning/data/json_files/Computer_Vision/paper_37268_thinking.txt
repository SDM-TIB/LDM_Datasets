To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Convolution in Convolution for Network in Network" by Yanwei Pang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on the **CIFAR10**, **augmented CIFAR10**, and **CIFAR100** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for understanding the experiments conducted.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experimental results section**. In this section, the authors provide specific information about each dataset:

1. **CIFAR10 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 10 classes of images, with 6,000 images per class, totaling 60,000 images. It is specified that 50,000 images are used for training and 10,000 for testing, with each image having three color channels and a size of 32 Ã— 32 pixels.

2. **Augmented CIFAR10 Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the CIFAR10 dataset by applying random flips to each training image, referred to as CIFAR10+. Additionally, a larger augmented dataset called CIFAR10++ is created by padding 4 pixels on each side of the images and then randomly cropping and flipping them.

3. **CIFAR100 Dataset**: Similar to CIFAR10, this dataset contains 100 classes, with the same number of training and testing images as CIFAR10. However, each class has only 600 images, making it more challenging for classification tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for these datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Master's thesis, Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, 2009.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. Each dataset will be described with its relevant details, including the number of classes, total images, training/testing splits, and image dimensions.

Finally, I will prepare the structured output for these datasets, ready for further processing or review.
