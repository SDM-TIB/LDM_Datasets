To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Staging E-Commerce Products for Online Advertising using Retrieval Assisted Image Generation" by Yueh-Ning Ku et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it discusses the use of product images, it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of ad images and the challenges faced in using un-staged product images. However, they do not specify any datasets here either. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Data)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors mention that they sampled data from **Yahoo Gemini DPA**, which spans November-December 2020. They collected a sample of approximately 18,899 ads, with specific counts for images with solid backgrounds and staged backgrounds. This section provides valuable information about the dataset used for their experiments.

The authors specify that they considered only furniture images with staged backgrounds, resulting in a final dataset of 2,071 images. This is a crucial detail that I need to capture.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Yahoo Gemini DPA dataset. However, since this dataset is likely proprietary or internal to Yahoo, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is from Yahoo Gemini DPA but may not have a standard citation format.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details as follows:

1. **Yahoo Gemini DPA**: A dataset sampled from Yahoo's Dynamic Product Ads, containing approximately 18,899 ads, with a focus on furniture images with staged backgrounds, resulting in 2,071 images.

Since the dataset does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is an internal dataset from Yahoo.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing or review.
