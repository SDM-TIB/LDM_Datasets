To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HyperStyle3D: Text-Guided 3D Portrait Stylization via Hypernetworks" by Zhuo Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the challenges of acquiring 3D data for portrait stylization and mentions the use of a pre-trained 3D-aware generator. However, it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the need for 3D data and references existing methods but does not name specific datasets either.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section**. This section typically contains details about the datasets used for evaluation. I will pay close attention to any subsections that might be dedicated to datasets or experimental setups. In this case, the experiments section discusses qualitative and quantitative results but does not specify any datasets used for training or evaluation.

I will also check the **related work section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of previous studies. This section mentions various methods and models but does not provide specific dataset names.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to identify any datasets that might be cited indirectly through the works of others. The references include a variety of papers, but I need to determine if any of these papers are associated with datasets relevant to the study.

After reviewing the entire paper, I find that the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets used in their experiments. However, they reference the **FFHQ dataset** (Flickr-Faces-HQ) in the context of training their model, which is a well-known dataset for high-quality face images.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered and provide the full citation for the FFHQ dataset:

- **FFHQ Dataset**:
  > Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. *A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 4401â€“4410, 2019.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude my extraction process here. I will ensure that the citation for the FFHQ dataset is included in the final output.
