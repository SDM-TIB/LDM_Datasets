To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Two-Stage Copy-Move Forgery Detection with Self Deep Matching and Proposal SuperGlue" by Yaqi Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that "Experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our two-stage framework," indicating that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges of copy-move forgery detection and mention that "the available copy-move forgery datasets are not sufficient for training an end-to-end deep matching network." This suggests that they may have created or utilized specific datasets for their experiments.

In the **experimental evaluation section**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention four datasets:

1. **Synthetic Testing Set**: This dataset is generated from MS COCO 2014 training images and consists of 120,000 training images and 1,000 testing images, created by pasting annotated regions from one image to another with various transformations.

2. **CoMoFoD Dataset**: This dataset consists of 200 copy-move forged images with a resolution of 512 × 512, processed under various post-processing conditions.

3. **CASIA CMFD Dataset**: Selected from the CASIA TIDEv2.0 dataset, it contains 1,313 CMFD samples and their authentic counterparts, provided as a HDF dataset.

4. **MICC-F220 Dataset**: Composed of 220 images, including 110 tampered images and 110 originals, used for image-level performance evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Synthetic Testing Set**, since it is generated by the authors, I will note that it is based on MS COCO 2014, which can be cited as:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, et al. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

- For the **CoMoFoD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. Tralic, I. Zupancic, S. Grgic, and M. Grgic. *Comofod—new database for copy-move forgery detection*. In Proceedings ELMAR-2013. IEEE, 2013, pp. 49–54.

- For the **CASIA CMFD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. Wu, W. Abd-Almageed, and P. Natarajan. *Busternet: Detecting copy-move image forgery with source/target localization*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2018, pp. 168–184.

- For the **MICC-F220 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > I. Amerini, L. Ballan, R. Caldelli, A. Del Bimbo, and G. Serra. *A sift-based forensic method for copy–move attack detection and transformation recovery*. IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, vol. 6, no. 3, pp. 1099–1110, 2011.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
