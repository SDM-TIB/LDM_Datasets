To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Encoded Prior Sliced Wasserstein AutoEncoder for Learning Latent Representations of Data" by Sanjukta Krishnagopal and Jacob Bedrossian, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of "benchmarked datasets" to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention using three datasets:

1. **3D Spiral Dataset**: This dataset is described as a 3D spiral randomly embedded in a 40D space with Gaussian noise. It consists of 10,000 samples.

2. **MNIST Dataset**: The authors mention using the MNIST dataset, which is a well-known dataset of handwritten digits. They describe the architecture used for processing this dataset and the specific configurations for training.

3. **CelebA Dataset**: This dataset consists of celebrity images and is downsized to 64x64 pixels for the experiments. The authors provide details about the architecture used for this dataset as well.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and CJ Burges. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. ATT Labs [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist, 2, 2010.

- For the **CelebA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Large-scale celebfaces attributes (celeba) dataset*. Retrieved August, 15:2018, 2018.

The **3D Spiral Dataset** is a synthetic dataset created for the purpose of this research, so it does not have a formal citation like the other two datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the MNIST and CelebA datasets, while noting that the 3D Spiral dataset is a synthetic dataset without a formal citation.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
