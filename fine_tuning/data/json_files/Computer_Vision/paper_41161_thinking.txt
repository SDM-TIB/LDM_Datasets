To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Iterative augmentation of visual evidence for weakly-supervised lesion localization in deep interpretability frameworks" by Cristina González-Gonzalo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference specific datasets relevant to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly the part that describes the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention several datasets:

1. **Kaggle DR Dataset**: This dataset is used for training, validation, and testing of the diabetic retinopathy (DR) classifier. It consists of images graded by severity according to the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy (ICDR) severity scale.

2. **AREDS Dataset**: This dataset is used for training, validating, and testing the age-related macular degeneration (AMD) classifier. It includes digitalized color fundus images from a long-term study of AMD development.

3. **DiaretDB1**: This dataset is utilized for assessing interpretability and weakly-supervised detection of DR abnormalities. It contains color fundus images with manually delineated areas by medical experts.

4. **EUGENDA Dataset**: This dataset is used for assessing localization of AMD lesions. It includes color fundus images with annotations according to the Cologne Image Reading Center and Laboratory protocol.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For the **Kaggle DR Dataset**:
  > "Diabetic retinopathy detection competition," Online, 2015. [Online]. Available: https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/

- For the **AREDS Dataset**:
  > Age-Related Eye Disease Study Research Group, “The Age-Related Eye Disease Study system for classifying age-related macular degeneration from stereoscopic color fundus photographs: the Age-Related Eye Disease Study report number 6,” *Am J Ophthalmol*, vol. 132, no. 5, pp. 668–681, 2001.

- For the **DiaretDB1**:
  > T. Kauppi et al., “The diaretDB1 diabetic retinopathy database and evaluation protocol,” in *British Machine Vision Conference*, vol. 1, 2007, pp. 1–10.

- For the **EUGENDA Dataset**:
  > S. Fauser et al., “Evaluation of serum lipid concentrations and genetic variants at high-density lipoprotein metabolism loci and TIMP3 in age-related macular degeneration,” *Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci*, vol. 52, no. 8, pp. 5525–5528, 2011.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
