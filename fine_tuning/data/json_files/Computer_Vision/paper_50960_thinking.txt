To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Direct Voxel Grid Optimization: Super-fast Convergence for Radiance Fields Reconstruction" by Cheng Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the method on "five inward-facing benchmarks," which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **Synthetic-NeRF Dataset**: Contains eight objects with realistic images synthesized by NeRF. The image resolution is set to 800 × 800 pixels, with 100 views for training and 200 views for testing.

2. **Synthetic-NSVF Dataset**: Another dataset containing eight objects synthesized by NSVF, following similar resolution and view setups as the Synthetic-NeRF dataset.

3. **BlendedMVS Dataset**: A synthetic MVS dataset with realistic ambient lighting, using a subset of four objects provided by NSVF. The image resolution is 768 × 576 pixels, with one-eighth of the images reserved for testing.

4. **Tanks & Temples Dataset**: A real-world dataset consisting of five scenes captured by an inward-facing camera. The image resolution is 1920 × 1080 pixels, with one-eighth of the images for testing.

5. **DeepVoxels Dataset**: Contains four simple Lambertian objects, with image resolutions of 512 × 512, where each scene has 479 views for training and 1000 views for testing.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
