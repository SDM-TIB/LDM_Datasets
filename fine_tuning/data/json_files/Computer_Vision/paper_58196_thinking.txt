To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FlatFormer: Flattened Window Attention for Efficient Point Cloud Transformer" by Zhijian Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that FlatFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the **Waymo Open Dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 5.1, the authors explicitly mention that they conduct experiments on the **Waymo Open Dataset (WOD)**, which consists of 1150 LiDAR point cloud sequences. This section provides details about the dataset, including the number of frames and the types of classes involved.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Waymo Open Dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Pei Sun, Henrik Kretzschmar, Xerxes Dotiwalla, Aurelien Chouard, Vijaysai Patnaik, Paul Tsui, James Guo, Yin Zhou, Yuning Chai, Benjamin Caine, Vijay Vasudevan, Wei Han, Jiquan Ngiam, Hang Zhao, Aleksei Timofeev, Scott Ettinger, Maxim Krivokon, Amy Gao, Aditya Joshi, Yu Zhang, Jonathon Shlens, Zhifeng Chen, and Dragomir Anguelov. *Scalability in Perception for Autonomous Driving: Waymo Open Dataset*. In CVPR, 2020.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the Waymo Open Dataset for its experiments, I will ensure to document this dataset thoroughly.

Now, I will compile the dataset information, including its name, description, and citation, into the required format for further processing. This will ensure that I have a complete and accurate representation of the dataset used in the research.
