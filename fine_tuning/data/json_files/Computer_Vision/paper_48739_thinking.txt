To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detection of Consonant Errors in Disordered Speech Based on Consonant-Vowel Segment Embedding" by Si-Ioi Ng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a neural network approach for detecting consonant errors in disordered speech, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Speech data)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two primary datasets:

1. **CUCHILD**: This is a large-scale speech database developed for research on automatic assessment of speech sound disorders (SSD) in Cantonese-speaking children. It contains speech data from 1,986 kindergarten children aged 3 to 6, with recordings made in various kindergartens in Hong Kong.

2. **CUSENT**: This is a large-vocabulary database of adult speech, containing about 20 hours of speech from 76 adult speakers, which was used to provide additional training data for the detection system.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CUCHILD**, the citation is:
  > S.-I. Ng, C. W.-Y. Ng, J. Wang, T. Lee, K. Y.-S. Lee, and M. C.-F. Tong, “CUCHILD: A Large-Scale Cantonese Corpus of Child Speech for Phonology and Articulation Assessment,” in Proc. of Interspeech, 2020, pp. 424–428.

- For **CUSENT**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation, it references the speech data from adult speakers, which is likely derived from existing resources in the field. If no specific citation is provided, I will note that it is a commonly used dataset in speech recognition research.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further studies in the field.
