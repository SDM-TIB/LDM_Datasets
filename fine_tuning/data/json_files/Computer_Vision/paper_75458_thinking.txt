To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Latent Watermark: Inject and Detect Watermarks in Latent Diffusion Space" by Zheling Meng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors discuss experiments conducted on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.1 (Experiment Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they state that three datasets are utilized:

1. **LAION-Aesthetics-5+**: This dataset contains 600 million image-text pairs with predicted aesthetics scores of 5 or higher. It is used for training the Latent Watermark (LW) model.

2. **MS-COCO 2017**: This dataset is referenced for evaluation purposes, specifically mentioning that 5,000 captions are randomly sampled from the validation set.

3. **Flickr30k**: Similar to MS-COCO, this dataset is also used for evaluation, with 5,000 captions sampled for generating images.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **LAION-Aesthetics-5+**, the citation is:
  > Christoph Schuhmann, Romain Beaumont, Richard Vencu, Cade Gordon, Ross Wightman, Mehdi Cherti, Theo Coombes, Aarush Katta, Clayton Mullis, Mitchell Wortsman, et al. *Laion-5b: An open large-scale dataset for training next generation image-text models*. In Proceedings of the Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), volume 35, pages 25278–25294, 2022.

- For **MS-COCO 2017**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755, 2014.

- For **Flickr30k**, the citation is:
  > Peter Young, Alice Lai, Micah Hodosh, and Julia Hockenmaier. *From image descriptions to visual denotations: New similarity metrics for semantic inference over event descriptions*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (TACL), 2:67–78, 2014.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
