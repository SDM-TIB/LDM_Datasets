To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic Segmentation for Urban-Scene Images" by Shorya Sharma, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of urban-scene image segmentation and references the Cityscapes dataset, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look specifically at the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.2 (Dataset)**, where the author describes the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the Cityscapes dataset is detailed, including its purpose and structure. The author states that the dataset consists of 5,000 images with high-quality pixel-level annotations and 20,000 images with coarse annotations, which confirms its significance in the study.

In this section, the author also explains how the dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets, which is crucial for understanding how the dataset is utilized in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Cityscapes dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proc. of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

Since the Cityscapes dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned and described in detail, I will compile this information into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's name, description, and citation, ready for any further processing or review.
