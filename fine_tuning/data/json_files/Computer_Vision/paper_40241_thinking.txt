To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Out-of-Distribution Detection Using Neural Rendering Generative Models" by Yujia Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors discuss using a generative model for out-of-distribution (OoD) detection and mention evaluating their method on various datasets, which suggests that datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3), where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using **CIFAR-10** as the in-distribution dataset and three out-of-distribution datasets: **SVHN**, **CIFAR-100**, and **CelebA**. This section provides clear information about the datasets used in their experiments.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **CIFAR-10**: The citation is:
   > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Technical report, Citeseer.

2. **SVHN**: The citation is:
   > Netzer, Y., Wang, T., Coates, A., Bissacco, A., Wu, B., & Ng, A. Y. (2011). Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning. 

3. **CIFAR-100**: The citation is:
   > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Technical report, Citeseer. (Note: CIFAR-100 is often referenced alongside CIFAR-10, as they are both part of the same dataset collection.)

4. **CelebA**: The citation is:
   > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). Deep learning face attributes in the wild. In Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. Each dataset will include its name, a brief description, and the full citation to ensure proper attribution.
