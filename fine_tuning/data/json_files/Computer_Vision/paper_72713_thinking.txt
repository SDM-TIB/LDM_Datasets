To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tactile-Augmented Radiance Fields" by Yiming Dou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected a dataset of tactile-augmented radiance fields (TaRFs), which suggests that there is a primary dataset to focus on.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the limitations of existing datasets and highlight that their dataset contains more touch samples than previous datasets, which reinforces the importance of the TaRF dataset.

In the **method section**, particularly in **section 4 (A 3D Visual-Tactile Dataset)**, the authors provide detailed information about their dataset collection process and statistics. They mention that their dataset includes 19.3k image pairs collected from 13 different scenes, which is crucial information for describing the dataset.

I will also check the **table 1** that compares their dataset with others, which lists various datasets and their characteristics. This table provides context for the TaRF dataset and its significance in comparison to others.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the TaRF dataset from the **references section**. The authors do not provide a separate citation for the TaRF dataset, but they do reference their own work throughout the paper. Therefore, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Yiming Dou, Fengyu Yang, Yi Liu, Antonio Loquercio, and Andrew Owens. *Tactile-Augmented Radiance Fields*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and citation in a structured format for clarity and future reference.
