To extract datasets from the research paper titled "iALS++: Speeding up Matrix Factorization with Subspace Optimization" by Steffen Rendle et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on benchmark problems like **Movielens 20M** and **Million Song Dataset**, which suggests that these datasets are used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors provide a **Table 2** that summarizes the datasets used in their experiments, including the number of users, interactions, and other relevant statistics.

From Table 2, I can identify the following datasets:

1. **Movielens 20M (ML20M)**: This dataset has 136,677 users and 20,108 items with a total of 10 million interactions. 

2. **Million Song Dataset (MSD)**: This dataset contains 571,355 users and 41,140 items with a total of 33.6 million interactions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Movielens 20M**, the citation is:
  > Harper, F. M., & Konstan, J. A. (2015). The Movielens Datasets: History and Context. *ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems*, 5(4), 19:1â€“19:19.

- For **Million Song Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bertin-Mahieux, T., Ellis, D. P. W., Whitman, B., & Lamere, P. (2011). The Million Song Dataset. In *Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR)*.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
