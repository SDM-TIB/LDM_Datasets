To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Cross-modal Backward-compatible Representation Learning for Vision-Language Models" by Young Kyun Jang and Ser-nam Lim, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their approach on various cross-modal benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation setup. In **section 4.1 (Setup)**, they mention using three popular image-text paired datasets for cross-modal retrieval evaluation:

1. **nocaps dataset**: This dataset is noted for its diverse distribution of object names and includes a validation split with 4,500 images and 45,000 captions.

2. **Flickr dataset**: Specifically referred to as Flickr-31K, this dataset consists of 31,783 images and 158,915 captions.

3. **COCO dataset**: Referred to as COCO-35K, this dataset includes 35,136 images and 175,680 captions.

In the **implementation details**, the authors provide further context about the datasets used, confirming their relevance to the experiments conducted.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **nocaps dataset**, the citation is:
  > Harsh Agrawal, Karan Desai, Yufei Wang, Xinlei Chen, Rishabh Jain, Mark Johnson, Dhruv Batra, Devi Parikh, Stefan Lee, and Peter Anderson. *Nocaps: Novel object captioning at scale*. In ICCV, 2019.

- For the **Flickr dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mark J Huiskes and Michael S Lew. *The mir flickr retrieval evaluation*. In ACM ICMR, pages 39–43, 2008.

- For the **COCO dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft coco: Common objects in context*. In ECCV, 2014.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
