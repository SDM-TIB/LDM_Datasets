To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MeshLRM: Large Reconstruction Model for High-Quality Meshes" by Xinyue Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention that their model is trained on the **Objaverse dataset** and fine-tuned on the **Objaverse-LVIS subset**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial to their research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Dataset and Evaluation Protocols)**, where the authors provide more details about the datasets used. Here, they explicitly state that the model is trained on the **Objaverse dataset**, which contains 730,000 objects, and fine-tuned on the **Objaverse-LVIS subset**, which consists of 46,000 objects. This section also mentions that they evaluate the reconstruction quality on the **GSO**, **NeRF-Synthetic**, and **OpenIllumination** datasets.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. I will refer to the **References section** to find the appropriate citations:

1. **Objaverse dataset**:
   - Citation: 
     > Deitke, M., Schwenk, D., Salvador, J., Weihs, L., Michel, O., VanderBilt, E., Schmidt, L., Ehsani, K., Kembhavi, A., Farhadi, A. *Objaverse: A universe of annotated 3D objects*. In: CVPR. pp. 13142–13153 (2023).

2. **Objaverse-LVIS subset**:
   - Since the Objaverse-LVIS subset is derived from the Objaverse dataset, I will use the same citation as above.

3. **GSO dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Downs, L., Francis, A., Koenig, N., Kinman, B., Hickman, R., Reymann, K., McHugh, T.B., Vanhoucke, V. *Google scanned objects: A high-quality dataset of 3D scanned household items*. In: 2022 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA). pp. 2553–2560. IEEE (2022).

4. **NeRF-Synthetic dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Mildenhall, B., Srinivasan, P.P., Tancik, M., Barron, J.T., Ramamoorthi, R., Ng, R. *NeRF: Representing scenes as neural radiance fields for view synthesis*. In: ECCV (2020).

5. **OpenIllumination dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Liu, I., Chen, L., Fu, Z., Wu, L., Jin, H., Li, Z., Wong, C.M.R., Xu, Y., Ramamoorthi, R., Xu, Z., et al. *Openillumination: A multi-illumination dataset for inverse rendering evaluation on real objects*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 36 (2024).

After collecting the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
