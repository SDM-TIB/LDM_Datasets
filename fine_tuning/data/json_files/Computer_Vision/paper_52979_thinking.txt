To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BiSyn-GAT+: Bi-Syntax Aware Graph Attention Network for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis" by Shuo Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on "four benchmark datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will look for the names of the datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant statistics that describe their structure or content.

In section 4.1, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Laptop Dataset**: This dataset is used for aspect-based sentiment analysis and contains sentences with multiple aspects. The statistics indicate the number of sentences in training and testing splits.

2. **Restaurant Dataset**: Similar to the Laptop dataset, this dataset is also used for aspect-based sentiment analysis and includes both multi-aspect and single-aspect sentences.

3. **MAMS Dataset**: This dataset is noted for containing sentences with at least two aspects that express different sentiments.

4. **Twitter Dataset**: This dataset consists of single-aspect sentences and is used for sentiment classification.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will look for are:

- For the **Laptop Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Maria Pontiki, Dimitris Galanis, John Pavlopoulos, Harris Papageorgiou, Ion Androutsopoulos, and Suresh Manandhar. *SemEval-2014 task 4: Aspect based sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2014), pages 27–35, Dublin, Ireland, 2014.

- For the **Restaurant Dataset**, it shares the same citation as the Laptop dataset since they are part of the same task.

- For the **MAMS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Qingnan Jiang, Lei Chen, Ruifeng Xu, Xiang Ao, and Min Yang. *A challenge dataset and effective models for aspect-based sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), pages 6280–6285, Hong Kong, China, 2019.

- For the **Twitter Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li Dong, Furu Wei, Chuanqi Tan, Duyu Tang, Ming Zhou, and Ke Xu. *Adaptive recursive neural network for target-dependent Twitter sentiment classification*. In Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers), pages 49–54, Baltimore, Maryland, 2014.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and citations, into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details about the datasets used in the research.
