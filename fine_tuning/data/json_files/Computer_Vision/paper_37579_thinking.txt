To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Star Shape Prior in Fully Convolutional Networks for Skin Lesion Segmentation" by Zahra Mirikharaji and Ghassan Hamarneh, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved the first rank in the ISBI 2017 skin segmentation challenge, which suggests that a specific dataset was used for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset used for validation. They state that they validated their segmentation approach on dermoscopy data provided by the **International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)** at the **ISBI 2017 Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection Challenge**. The dataset consists of 2000 training images, 150 validation images, and 600 test images, which is crucial information for dataset extraction.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The relevant reference for the ISBI 2017 challenge is:

- Codella et al. (2017). *Skin lesion analysis toward melanoma detection: A challenge at the 2017 international symposium on biomedical imaging (ISBI), hosted by the international skin imaging collaboration (ISIC)*. arXiv:1710.05006.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation.

After completing these steps, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
