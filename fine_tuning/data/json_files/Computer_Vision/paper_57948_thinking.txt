To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detachable Novel Views Synthesis of Dynamic Scenes Using Distribution-Driven Neural Radiance Fields" by Boyu Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating the method on "public dynamic scenes" and "urban driving scenes acquired from an autonomous-driving dataset," which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Metrics)**, where the authors provide specific details about the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Urban Driving Scenes**: This dataset consists of real-world street scenes captured from the Argoverse dataset. The authors describe it as containing video clips depicting outdoor scenes with dynamic actions, recorded at 30 Hz, with each clip spanning 20-50 frames at a resolution of 436 Ã— 272.

2. **NVIDIA Dynamic Scenes**: This dataset includes scenes captured by both handheld monocular cameras and stationary multi-view cameras. The authors specify that they selected 7 multi-view scenes for evaluation, with each scene containing 20 to 30 frames extracted from the source video.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets. The citation for the Argoverse dataset is:

- For **Argoverse**:

In Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems Track on Datasets and Benchmarks (NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks 2021), 2021.

The citation for the NVIDIA dynamic scenes dataset is:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that I accurately represent the information extracted from the paper. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research.
