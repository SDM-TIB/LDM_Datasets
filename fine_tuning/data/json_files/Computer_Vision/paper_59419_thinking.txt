To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fiber Tract Shape Measures Inform Prediction of Non-Imaging Phenotypes" by Wan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used data from the **Human Connectome Project (HCP)** young adult dataset, which is a significant dataset in neuroimaging research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **methodology** section. In section 2.1, the authors mention that they used **dMRI and demographic/behavioral data from 1065 subjects (490 female, ages 22-37)** in the HCP young adult dataset. This confirms the dataset's relevance and size.

I will also check the **references** section to find the full citation for the Human Connectome Project dataset. The citation is as follows:
- **Human Connectome Project (HCP)**: 
  > Van Essen, D.C., Smith, S.M., Barch, D.M., Behrens, T.E.J., Yacoub, E., & Ugurbil, K. (2013). The WU-Minn Human Connectome Project: an overview. *Neuroimage*, 80, 62-79.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to various cognitive measures derived from the NIH Toolbox, but these are not datasets in the traditional sense; they are assessments used in conjunction with the HCP data.

After reviewing the entire paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Human Connectome Project dataset. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

In summary, the key steps are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Examine the methodology section for detailed descriptions of the datasets used.
3. Retrieve full citations from the references section.
4. Compile the information clearly, focusing on the Human Connectome Project dataset as the primary dataset used in the study.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets relevant to the research paper.
