To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GINet: Graph Interaction Network for Scene Parsing" by Tianyi Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to their method's performance on "popular benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for scene parsing. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **Pascal-Context**: The authors describe it as a classic set of annotations for PASCAL VOC2010, containing 10,103 images, with a specific breakdown of training and validation images.

2. **COCO Stuff**: This dataset is noted to have a total of 10,000 images across 183 classes, with a division of 9,000 images for training and 1,000 for validation.

3. **ADE20K**: The authors mention that this is a large-scale dataset for scene parsing, consisting of 25,000 images and 151 categories, with a specified split for training, validation, and testing.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Pascal-Context**, the citation is:
  > Mottaghi, R., Chen, X., Liu, X., Cho, N.G., Lee, S.W., Fidler, S., Urtasun, R., & Yuille, A. (2014). *The role of context for object detection and semantic segmentation in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For **COCO Stuff**, the citation is:
  > Caesar, H., Uijlings, J., & Ferrari, V. (2018). *Coco-stuff: Thing and stuff classes in context*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For **ADE20K**, the citation is:
  > Zhou, B., Zhao, H., Puig, X., Fidler, S., Barriuso, A., & Torralba, A. (2017). *Scene parsing through ADE20K dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for further processing or review.
