To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can Dense Connectivity Benefit Outlier Detection? An Odyssey with NAS" by Hao Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on **CIFAR benchmarks**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the significance of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection and mention the use of **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets for their experiments. This suggests that these datasets are central to their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In **section 4.1 (Experiment Setup)**, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their method on the **CIFAR-10 versus CIFAR-100** and **CIFAR-100 versus CIFAR-10** detection tasks. They also mention using a modified version of **80 Million Tiny Images** as auxiliary outlier training data, which is crucial for their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. **CIFAR-10**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset of images*. 2009. [Online]. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

2. **CIFAR-100**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-100: The CIFAR-100 dataset of images*. 2009. [Online]. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

3. **80 Million Tiny Images**:
   > A. Torralba, R. Fergus, and W. T. Freeman. *80 Million Tiny Images: A Large Data Set for Nonparametric Object and Scene Recognition*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 30(11):1958â€“1970, 2008.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets used in the paper:

- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
- **80 Million Tiny Images**: A dataset containing 80 million images collected from the internet, used as auxiliary outlier training data.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
