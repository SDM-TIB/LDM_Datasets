To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Omni-Directional Image Generation from Single Snapshot Image" by Keisuke Okubo and Takao Yamanaka, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for omni-directional images (ODIs) and hints at the use of datasets for training deep learning models, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they state that they utilized the **SUN360 dataset**. I will look for a detailed description of this dataset, including its contents and any specific characteristics mentioned in the text.

In this section, the authors describe the SUN360 dataset as containing images from 30 outdoor scenes, but they also note that some classes were excluded due to an imbalance in the number of images. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and its application in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SUN360 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Jianxiong Xiao, Krista A. Ehinger, Aude Oliva, and Antonio Torralba. *Recognizing scene viewpoint using panoramic place representation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2695-2702, 2012.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the SUN360 dataset.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the SUN360 dataset, ensuring that it is ready for any downstream processing or review.
