To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PixelRL: Fully Convolutional Network with Reinforcement Learning for Image Processing" by Ryosuke Furuta et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the applications of the proposed method, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that detail the applications of the proposed method. In this paper, the authors mention applying their method to various tasks such as image denoising, image restoration, local color enhancement, and saliency-driven image editing. Each of these tasks may involve specific datasets.

In the **image denoising section**, the authors state that they used the **BSD68 dataset**, which consists of 428 training images and 68 test images. This is a clear identification of a dataset used in their experiments.

For the **image restoration task**, the authors mention using a combination of the **BSD68 dataset**, **Waterloo exploration database**, and **ILSVRC2015 validation set**. This indicates that multiple datasets are involved in this application.

In the **local color enhancement section**, the authors refer to a dataset created by Yan et al. (2016), which includes 70 training images and 45 test images downloaded from Flickr. This dataset is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

Finally, in the **saliency-driven image editing section**, the authors mention using a dataset created by Mechrez et al. (2018), which contains 101 images and corresponding masks. This dataset is essential for the specific application discussed.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for further processing or review.
