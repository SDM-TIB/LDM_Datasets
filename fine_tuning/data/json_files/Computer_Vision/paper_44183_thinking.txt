To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Intrinsic-Extrinsic Convolution and Pooling for Learning on 3D Protein Structures" by Pedro Hermosilla et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed algorithms on common downstream tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention two specific tasks: protein fold classification and enzyme-catalyzed reaction classification. I will look for details about the datasets used for these tasks.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **SCOPe 1.75 Dataset**: This dataset is used for protein fold classification and consists of 16,712 proteins from 1,195 folds. The authors obtained the 3D structures of the proteins from the SCOPe 1.75 database.

2. **Enzyme Reaction Dataset**: This dataset includes 37,428 proteins from 384 EC numbers, split into training, validation, and testing sets. The authors collected this data from the SIFTS database, which contains EC annotations for entries in the Protein Data Bank (PDB).

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **SCOPe 1.75 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hou, J., Adhikari, B., & Cheng, J. (2018). DeepSF: Deep convolutional neural network for mapping protein sequences to folds. In Proceedings of the 2018 ACM International Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Health Informatics.

- For the **Enzyme Reaction Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Webb, E. C. (1992). Enzyme Nomenclature 1992. Academic Press.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all relevant information is included for downstream processing.
