To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Zero-Shot Multi-Modal Artist-Controlled Retrieval and Exploration of 3D Object Sets" by Kristofer Schlachter et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a **3D asset database** for retrieval, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper. The introduction emphasizes the need for a system that can handle diverse inputs for 3D content creation, hinting at the datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **results sections**. In this paper, the authors describe their approach to 3D model retrieval and mention that they used **ShapeNet** as the primary dataset. 

In the **Data Setup section**, they specify that they utilized **5 categories of ShapeNet**: sofa, chair, table, car, and plane, which collectively comprise roughly **25,000 meshes**. This is a crucial detail as it outlines the specific dataset categories used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ShapeNet dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **ShapeNet**: 
  > Angel X. Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, Leonidas Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qixing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Hao Su, Jianxiong Xiao, Li Yi, and Fisher Yu. 2015. *ShapeNet: An Information-Rich 3D Model Repository*. Technical Report arXiv:1512.03012 [cs.GR]. Stanford University — Princeton University — Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that **ShapeNet** is the primary dataset used for their research.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the ShapeNet dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
