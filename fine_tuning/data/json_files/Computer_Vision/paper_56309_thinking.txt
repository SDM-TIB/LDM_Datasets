To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Data Augmentation for Weed Recognition Enhancement: A Diffusion Probabilistic Model and Transfer Learning Based Approach" by Dong Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of a common weed dataset, **CottonWeedID15**, which is a strong indicator that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Materials and Methods)**, specifically **subsection 2.1**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the **CottonWeedID15 dataset**. This section outlines that the dataset contains 5,187 images of 15 common weed classes, collected under natural light conditions, and discusses the class distribution and partitioning for training and testing.

In addition to CottonWeedID15, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper. In the introduction, the authors reference several datasets used in previous studies, such as:

1. **Plant Seedlings Dataset**: Mentioned in the context of improving model accuracy through pretraining.
2. **Early Crop Weeds Dataset**: Also referenced for its role in enhancing classification performance.
3. **DeepWeeds Dataset**: Cited for its use in weed identification tasks.
4. **YOLOWeeds Dataset**: Mentioned as part of the discussion on dedicated image datasets for weed control.

I will ensure to note down the specific details about each dataset, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the research.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets. 

The citations I will extract include:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and that the full citations are included for reference. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
