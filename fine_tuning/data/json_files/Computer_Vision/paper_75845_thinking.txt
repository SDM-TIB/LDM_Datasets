To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Rethinking Feature Backbone Fine-tuning for Remote Sensing Object Detection" by Yechan Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on two datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges in remote sensing object detection and mention the need for datasets that can bridge the gap between natural and remote sensing images. This suggests that specific datasets will be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly section 3.3, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **DOTA (Dataset for Object Detection in Aerial Images)**: This dataset consists of 2,806 aerial images and includes 188,282 bounding box labels across 15 object categories, such as 'car', 'ship', and 'harbor'.

2. **DIOR-R (Dataset for Object Detection in Remote Sensing)**: This dataset contains 23,463 images with 192,512 instances across 20 object categories, making it larger and more diverse than DOTA.

The authors also note that they only consider labels for oriented object detection in their experiments, which is particularly relevant for remote sensing applications.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **DOTA**, the citation is:
  > G.-S. Xia et al., “DOTA: A large-scale dataset for object detection in aerial images,” in *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*, 2018.

- For **DIOR-R**, the citation is:
  > G. Cheng et al., “Anchor-free oriented proposal generator for object detection,” *IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (TGRS)*, 2022.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further processing or review of the extracted datasets.
