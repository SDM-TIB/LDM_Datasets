To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "High-Resolution Reference Image Assisted Volumetric Super-Resolution of Cardiac Diffusion Weighted Imaging" by Yinzhe Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a general overview of the study but does not specify datasets. However, the methods section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used.

In **section 2.1 (Dataset Acquisition and Pre-processing)**, the authors describe the data acquisition process. They mention that data was acquired from **10 healthy swine heart samples**. This indicates that there is a dataset related to cardiac imaging, specifically diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI).

Next, I will note the specifics of the dataset:
- The dataset consists of **10 healthy swine heart samples** that were frozen, defrosted, and fixed for varying periods (from 2 weeks to 6 months) before scanning. This variability is important for understanding the noise levels in the images, which is relevant for deep learning model training.
- The imaging was performed using a **Siemens Vida 3 T MRI scanner** with specific parameters for diffusion-weighted imaging.

The authors also mention that the dataset was split into training, validation, and testing cases with a ratio of 5:2:3, resulting in **1664 training slices, 864 validation slices, and 1120 testing slices**. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and usage.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. However, the dataset itself (the swine heart samples) does not have a formal citation since it is original data collected by the authors.

Since the dataset is not published in a separate paper, I will summarize the dataset details as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: Healthy Swine Heart Samples
- **Description**: A dataset consisting of 10 healthy swine heart samples used for diffusion-weighted imaging. The samples were frozen, defrosted, and fixed for varying periods before scanning.
- **Acquisition Method**: Siemens Vida 3 T MRI scanner with diffusion-weighted spin-echo acquisition mode.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset entry with the relevant details, ensuring to include the authors' names and the context of the dataset as described in the paper. Since there is no formal citation for the dataset, I will note it as original data collected by the authors.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for structured output.
