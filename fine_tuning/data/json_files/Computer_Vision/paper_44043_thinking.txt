To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Sample Collision with Neural Networks" by Tuan Tran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses a framework for motion planning but does not specify datasets. However, it does indicate that the framework is evaluated on various planning problems, which suggests that datasets may be present in the methodology.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Implementation Details)**, particularly the subsection titled **A. Data Collection**. Here, the authors describe the workspaces used for training and testing their models. They mention three types of workspaces:

1. **2D Simple Workspaces (2DS)**: The training dataset consists of 30 workspaces, and the testing datasets include 30 seen and 10 unseen workspaces.
2. **3D Office-like Workspaces (3DO)**: The training dataset comprises 100 workspaces, with 100 known and 20 unseen workspaces for testing.
3. **3D Clutter Workspaces (3DC)**: The training dataset includes 50 workspaces, with 30 known and 10 unseen workspaces for testing.

The authors provide specific details about the number of obstacles and their configurations in these workspaces, which is crucial for understanding the datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. However, the paper does not cite specific datasets like publicly available datasets; instead, it describes the datasets created for the experiments.

Since the datasets are generated by the authors and not publicly available, I will summarize them as follows:

1. **2D Simple Workspaces (2DS)**: 
   - Description: A dataset of 30 randomly generated 2D workspaces, each containing 3 to 5 obstacle blocks.
   - Citation: Not applicable (dataset created by authors).

2. **3D Office-like Workspaces (3DO)**: 
   - Description: A dataset of 100 randomly generated 3D office-like workspaces, each containing 25 to 30 obstacle blocks.
   - Citation: Not applicable (dataset created by authors).

3. **3D Clutter Workspaces (3DC)**: 
   - Description: A dataset of 50 randomly generated 3D clutter workspaces, each containing 110 to 125 obstacle blocks.
   - Citation: Not applicable (dataset created by authors).

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. Although the datasets are not publicly cited, I will ensure to document their descriptions accurately based on the information provided in the paper.
