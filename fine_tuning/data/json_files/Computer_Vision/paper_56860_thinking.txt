To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MixUp-MIL: Novel Data Augmentation for Multiple Instance Learning and a Study on Thyroid Cancer Diagnosis" by Michael Gadermayr et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted an exhaustive study based on two thyroid cancer datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention that the dataset consists of **80 whole slide images (WSIs)**, divided into frozen and paraffin sections, with specific details about the number of samples for each type. This section is crucial as it provides the context and specifics about the datasets used.

In the **Results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their methods on these datasets, confirming their relevance and importance in the experiments conducted.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific dataset citations, but it does refer to the original sources of the data used in the experiments. 

The relevant citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. For the dataset of thyroid cancer WSIs, the citation is:
   > Gadermayr, M., Tschuchnig, M., Stangassinger, L.M., Kreutzer, C., Couillard-Despres, S., Oostingh, G.J., Hittmair, A. *Frozen-to-paraffin: Categorization of histological frozen sections by the aid of paraffin sections and generative adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the MICCAI Workshop on Simulation and Synthesis in Medical Imaging (SASHIMI), pages 99–109, 2021.

2. For the general methodology and context of multiple instance learning in histopathology, I will refer to:
   > Li, B., Li, Y., Eliceiri, K.W. *Dual-stream multiple instance learning network for whole slide image classification with self-supervised contrastive learning*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 14318–14328, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or analysis.
