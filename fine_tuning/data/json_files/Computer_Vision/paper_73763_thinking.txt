To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long and Short Guidance in Score identity Distillation for One-Step Text-to-Image Generation" by Mingyuan Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on the **COCO-2014 validation set**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in their experiments. I will note this down as a potential dataset.

Next, I will look into the **experiments** section, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will pay close attention to any specific mentions of datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors specifically mention the **COCO-2014 dataset** in the context of evaluating their method. They report achieving a record low Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) on this dataset, which confirms its use in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the COCO-2014 dataset. The citation is as follows:
- **COCO-2014 Dataset**:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European conference on computer vision, pages 740–755. Springer, 2014.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the COCO-2014 dataset for its experiments, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the COCO-2014 dataset, ensuring that it is ready for any downstream processing or review.
