To extract datasets from the research paper titled "StNet: Local and Global Spatial-Temporal Modeling for Action Recognition" by Dongliang He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to experiments conducted on the **Kinetics dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metric)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Kinetics Dataset**: The authors describe two versions of this dataset:
   - **Kinetics400**: Contains 400 human action classes with over 400 clips for each class and a validation set of about 20,000 video clips.
   - **Kinetics600**: An extended version with 600 action categories and approximately 400,000 trimmed video clips in the training set and 30,000 clips in the validation set.

2. **UCF101 Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as a smaller dataset used for transfer learning experiments. It contains 101 human action categories and a total of 13,320 labeled video clips, divided into three training/testing splits.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Kinetics dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kay, W.; Carreira, J.; Simonyan, K.; Zhang, B.; Hillier, C.; Vijayanarasimhan, S.; Viola, F.; Green, T.; Back, T.; Natsev, P.; et al. *The kinetics human action video dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.06950, 2017.

- For the **UCF101 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Soomro, K.; Zamir, A. R.; and Shah, M. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
