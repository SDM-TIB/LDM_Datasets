To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AiGen-FoodReview: A Multimodal Dataset of Machine-Generated Restaurant Reviews and Images on Social Media" by Alessandro Gambetti and Qiwei Han, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates the creation of a dataset consisting of **21,143 restaurant review-image pairs**, which suggests that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will look closely at the **methodology section**, specifically the **Dataset Methodology** subsection. Here, the authors describe how they collected data from **Yelp**, resulting in **447,377 textual reviews** and associated images. They mention that they focused on reviews from **Yelp's elite users**, which adds credibility to the dataset.

The paper also specifies that the dataset is divided into two classes: **authentic reviews (Class 0)** and **machine-generated reviews (Class 1)**, with a total of **20,144 review-image pairs** created. This is a crucial detail as it outlines the structure of the dataset.

In the **conclusion**, the authors reiterate the dataset's significance and its potential applications in detecting fake reviews, emphasizing its multimodal nature. This reinforces the importance of the dataset in the context of the research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the **Yelp dataset** as the source of authentic reviews, which is publicly available. The citation for the Yelp dataset is:

- **Yelp Dataset**: 
  > Yelp. *Yelp Dataset*. Available at: https://www.yelp.com/dataset.

Additionally, the authors mention that the machine-generated reviews were created using **OpenAI's GPT-4-Turbo** and **DALL-E-2** models. While these are not datasets in the traditional sense, they are essential tools used to generate the synthetic data. The citations for these models are:

- **GPT-4-Turbo**:
  > OpenAI. *GPT-4 Technical Report*. arXiv:2303.08774.

- **DALL-E-2**:
  > Ramesh, A., Dhariwal, P., Nichol, A., Chu, C., and Chen, M. (2022). *Hierarchical Text-Conditional Image Generation with CLIP Latents*. arXiv:2204.06125.

After compiling this information, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
