To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Transmission in QoE-Driven Backhaul-Aware MC-NOMA Cognitive Radio Network" by Hosein Zarini et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. The abstract discusses a resource allocation framework and mentions simulation results, but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction also focuses on the theoretical framework and does not provide specific dataset names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, there is no clearly labeled section for datasets, but the **simulation results** section may contain relevant information. I will carefully read through the **simulation results** and **conclusions** to see if any datasets are referenced indirectly through the description of the experiments conducted.

Upon reviewing the **simulation results**, I note that the authors discuss various multimedia services (web, video, audio) and their performance metrics, but they do not specify any datasets used for these simulations. Instead, they refer to parameters and configurations for the simulations without citing any external datasets.

Since no specific datasets are mentioned in the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any cited works might refer to datasets that could be relevant to the research. However, the references primarily consist of theoretical works and previous studies on QoE, NOMA, and resource allocation, without direct mention of datasets.

In conclusion, after thoroughly reviewing the paper, I find that there are no explicit datasets provided or referenced in the text. Therefore, I will document this finding, noting that while the paper discusses simulation results and performance metrics, it does not provide any datasets or their citations.

I will summarize my findings as follows:
- No datasets were explicitly mentioned in the paper.
- The authors focused on theoretical frameworks and simulation results without referencing specific datasets.
- The references do not include datasets but rather theoretical studies related to the topic.

This thorough examination confirms that there are no datasets to extract from this particular research paper.
