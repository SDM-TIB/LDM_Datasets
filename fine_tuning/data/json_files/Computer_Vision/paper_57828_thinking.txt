To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond Information Exchange: An Approach to Deploy Network Properties for Information Diffusion" by Soumita Das et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental analysis sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed CNS algorithm on several real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Analysis)**, where the authors mention the datasets used for their experiments. They specifically list four datasets in **Table 1**:

1. **Karate Dataset**: This dataset represents Zachary’s Karate Club, which consists of 34 nodes and 78 edges.
2. **Les Misérables Dataset**: This dataset represents the network of characters in the novel "Les Misérables," consisting of 77 nodes and 254 edges.
3. **Jazz Dataset**: This dataset represents a network of jazz musicians, containing 198 nodes and 2,742 edges.
4. **Polblogs Dataset**: This dataset represents a network of political blogs, with 1,224 nodes and 16,718 edges.

I will also verify the details of these datasets in the **References section** to ensure I can provide accurate citations. The authors reference the datasets as follows:

- For the **Karate Dataset**, the citation is:
  > W. W. Zachary, “An information flow model for conflict and fission in small groups,” *Journal of Anthropological Research*, vol. 33, no. 4, pp. 452–473, 1977.

- For the **Les Misérables Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. E. Knuth, “The Stanford Graph Base: A platform for combinatorial algorithms,” in *SODA*, Austin Texas USA, Jan. 25–27, 1993, pp. 41–43.

- For the **Jazz Dataset**, the citation is:
  > P. M. Gleiser and L. Danon, “Community structure in jazz,” *Advances in Complex Systems*, vol. 6, no. 04, pp. 565–573, 2003.

- For the **Polblogs Dataset**, the citation is:
  > L. A. Adamic and N. Glance, “The political blogosphere and the 2004 US election: divided they blog,” in *Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Link Discovery*, Chicago Illinois, Aug. 21–25, 2005, pp. 36–43.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the paper.
