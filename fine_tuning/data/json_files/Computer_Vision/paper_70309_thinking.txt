To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Provable Multi-Party Reinforcement Learning with Diverse Human Feedback" by Huiying Zhong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments or evaluations. In this case, the abstract discusses the theoretical study of multi-party reinforcement learning but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** or **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. I will pay close attention to any subsections that might be dedicated to datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Data Collection." If the paper includes a section that describes the experimental setup, it may also reference specific datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that there are no specific datasets mentioned in the methodology or experiments sections. The authors focus on theoretical contributions and do not provide empirical results based on specific datasets.

Since no datasets are explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will check the **references** section to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through other works. This could include foundational papers or datasets that are commonly used in the field of reinforcement learning with human feedback.

After reviewing the references, I find that the paper cites several foundational works related to reinforcement learning and human feedback, but again, no specific datasets are referenced.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings:
1. The paper does not mention any specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.
2. There are no datasets referenced in the methodology or experiments sections.
3. The references do not include any datasets, focusing instead on theoretical contributions.

Since no datasets are available for extraction, I will not create any dataset entries or citations. However, I will document this process to ensure clarity in my findings and to assist in future research efforts.
