To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comparison of Embedded Deep Learning Methods for Person Detection" by Chloe Eunhyang Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used an "in-house proprietary dataset" consisting of over 10,000 indoor images captured from shopping malls and retail stores. This suggests that there is a specific dataset that I need to describe.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Research Framework)**, particularly the **Data Acquisition** subsection, where the authors provide more details about the dataset. They mention that the dataset comprises a total of 10,972 images, which were captured under various conditions and manually annotated. This section confirms the existence of a proprietary dataset and provides additional context about its composition and purpose.

The authors also mention that the dataset was divided into training, testing, and validation sets, which is important information to include in the dataset description.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the dataset. However, since the dataset is proprietary and created by the authors themselves, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is in-house and does not have a formal citation.

Based on this information, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **In-house Proprietary Dataset**: This dataset consists of 10,972 images captured from CCTV cameras in indoor retail environments. The images were manually annotated to create ground truth for training and evaluation of deep learning models. The dataset is divided into training (5,790 images), testing (2,152 images), and validation (3,030 images) sets.

Since there are no formal citations for this proprietary dataset, I will note that it is an in-house dataset created by the authors.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly describes the dataset, ensuring that I highlight its proprietary nature and the absence of a formal citation.
