To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comparative Study of High-Recall Real-Time Semantic Segmentation Based on Swift Factorized Network" by Kaite Xiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors performed experiments on state-of-the-art datasets, specifically mentioning **CamVid** and **Cityscapes**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for the study.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4, the authors state that they conducted experiments on **CamVid** and **Cityscapes**, providing insights into their characteristics and relevance to the study. 

1. **CamVid Dataset**: The authors mention that CamVid is used for semantic segmentation tasks and consists of images with various classes relevant to autonomous driving. They also note that it has 11 classes, including sky, building, pole, road, sidewalk, tree, sign, fence, car, pedestrian, and bicyclist.

2. **Cityscapes Dataset**: Similarly, the Cityscapes dataset is referenced as another benchmark for semantic segmentation, particularly for urban scene understanding. The authors highlight its high-resolution images and the diversity of classes it includes.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CamVid**, the citation is:
  > Brostow, G. J., Fauqueur, J., & Cipolla, R. (2009). *Semantic object classes in video: A high-definition ground truth database*. Pattern Recognition Letters, 30(2), 88-97.

- For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:
  > Cordts, M., Omran, M., Ramos, S., Rehfeld, T., Enzweiler, M., Benenson, R., Franke, U., Roth, S., & Schiele, B. (2016). *The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 3213-3223.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for future reference.
