To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MambaTalk: Efficient Holistic Gesture Synthesis with Selective State Space Models" by Zunnan Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions advancements in gesture synthesis and references the use of datasets, which indicates that there may be specific datasets discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges in gesture synthesis and mention the use of new datasets. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets that are introduced or referenced.

In the **experiments section (4)**, the authors explicitly mention the **BEATX-standard dataset**. I will take note of the details provided about this dataset, including its size, the number of sequences, and the context in which it is used. The authors state that the dataset contains 60 hours of data with high finger quality for 25 speakers, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's scope.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the BEATX-standard dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Haiyang Liu, Zihao Zhu, Giorgio Becherini, Yichen Peng, Mingyang Su, You Zhou, Naoya Iwamoto, Bo Zheng, and Michael J Black. *Emage: Towards unified holistic co-speech gesture generation via masked audio gesture modeling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2401.00374, 2023.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the BEATX-standard dataset is the primary dataset used in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will allow for easy reference and further analysis of the dataset used in the research.
