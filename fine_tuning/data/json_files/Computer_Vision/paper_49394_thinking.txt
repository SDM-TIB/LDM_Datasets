To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Acyclic and Cyclic Reversing Computations in Petri Nets" by Kamila Barylska and Anna Gogoli≈Ñska, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and conclusion** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a summary of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include datasets used for experiments or validation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. These sections typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the research.

If the paper includes a **results or experiments section**, I will check for any references to datasets used in the experiments. This is crucial as it often confirms the datasets that were actually employed in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset called "XYZ Dataset" and provides a brief description, I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If the citation is not directly provided, I may need to search for it online or in related literature.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the citation formatted according to academic standards.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a comprehensive overview for future reference or analysis.
