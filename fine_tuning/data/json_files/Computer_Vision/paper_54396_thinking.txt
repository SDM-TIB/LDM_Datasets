To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MULTICLASS-SGCN: SPARSE GRAPH-BASED TRAJECTORY PREDICTION WITH AGENT CLASS EMBEDDING" by Ruochen Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method was evaluated on the **Stanford Drone Dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is relevant.

Next, I will look into the **introduction** section for further details. The authors discuss the challenges of trajectory prediction and mention various models but do not introduce new datasets here. However, they do reference the Stanford Drone Dataset again, confirming its importance for their experiments.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors explicitly state that their model was trained and validated on the **Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD)**. They provide details about the dataset, including that it has class labels for six different types of agents (pedestrian, cyclist, cart, car, skater, and bus) and that the data was captured from a bird’s-eye view by a drone over Stanford University’s campus. This section solidifies the relevance of the dataset for their research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Stanford Drone Dataset. The citation is as follows:
> A. Robicquet, A. Sadeghian, A. Alahi, and S. Savarese. *Learning social etiquette: Human trajectory understanding in crowded scenes*. In ECCV, 2016, pp. 549–565.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the Stanford Drone Dataset, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Stanford Drone Dataset, ensuring that it is clear and complete for any future use or analysis.
