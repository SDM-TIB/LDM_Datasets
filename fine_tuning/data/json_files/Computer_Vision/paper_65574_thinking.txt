To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SILC: Improving Vision Language Pretraining with Self-Distillation" by Muhammad Ferjad Naeem et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of "web-scale image caption datasets," which indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to identify their specific names and details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section, which is often where authors describe the datasets they used for their experiments. In this paper, I will check sections that discuss the methodology and experiments, particularly **section 4 (Experiments)**, as it typically contains information about the datasets used for evaluation.

Upon reviewing **section 4.1 (Implementation Details)**, I find that the authors mention using the **WebLI dataset** for their experiments. This dataset is crucial as it serves as the foundation for their training framework.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the WebLI dataset. The citation is as follows:

In ICLR, 2023.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, especially in the **experiments** or **results** sections. I will pay attention to any references to datasets used for specific tasks like zero-shot segmentation, open vocabulary detection, or any other evaluations.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, along with their authoritative references.
