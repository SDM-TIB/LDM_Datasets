To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Benefit of Adversarial Training for Monocular Depth Estimation" by Rick Groenendijk et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often discusses the context and prior work, which might reference datasets used in related studies.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention using the **KITTI dataset** and the **CityScapes dataset** for their evaluations. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and the specific splits used for training and testing.

In the paper, the authors describe the **KITTI dataset** as containing image pairs of a car driving in various environments, with a specific mention of the Eigen data split, which includes 22.6K training images, 888 validation images, and 697 test images. They also mention using the **CityScapes dataset**, which consists of almost 25,000 images, with 22.9K training images, 500 validation images, and 1525 test images.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **KITTI dataset**, the citation is:
> Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, Christoph Stiller, and Raquel Urtasun. *Vision meets Robotics: The KITTI Dataset*. International Journal of Robotics Research, 32(11):1231-1237, 2013.

For the **CityScapes dataset**, the citation is:
> Mario Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sergio Ramos, Thomas Rehfeld, Uwe Franke, Rainer Benenson, and Bernt Schiele. *The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work.
