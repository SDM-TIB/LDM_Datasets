To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative Diffusion Models for Lattice Field Theory" by Lingxiao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on generative diffusion models and their application in lattice field theory, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the computational challenges in lattice field theory and mentions the use of generative models, but again, it does not specify any datasets.

I will then look into the **numerical results section** (section 3) where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention that they prepared **5120 configurations as training datasets** in two setups for a toy model. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name or citation for these configurations.

In the same section, they refer to a **scalar lattice field theory** and describe the action used, but they do not mention a specific dataset name or citation either. The paper seems to focus more on the methodology and results rather than on publicly available datasets.

Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset names or citations, I will check the **references section** to see if any of the cited works correspond to datasets. The references include various papers related to machine learning and lattice field theory, but they do not appear to be datasets themselves.

Given that the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets with full citations, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Training Configurations for Toy Model**: The authors prepared 5120 configurations for training, but no specific dataset name or citation is provided.
2. **Scalar Lattice Field Theory**: The authors describe a theoretical framework but do not reference a specific dataset.

Since no datasets with full citations are identified in the paper, I will conclude that the authors did not utilize publicly available datasets or did not specify them in the text. 

In summary, I will document the absence of explicit datasets in the paper and note that the authors focused on theoretical models and their applications rather than on specific datasets.
