To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adjacent-level Feature Cross-Fusion with 3-D CNN for Remote Sensing Image Change Detection" by Yuanxin Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention validating their method on **three challenging remote sensing CD datasets**. This indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. They specifically mention three datasets:

1. **WHU-CD**: This dataset is described as a public building change detection dataset containing pairs of images with a spatial resolution of 0.2m and a size of 32507Ã—15354 pixels. The authors mention that the dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **LEVIR-CD**: This dataset consists of 637 image pairs collected from Google Earth images with a spatial resolution of 0.5m. The authors provide details about the size of the images and how the dataset is divided for training, validation, and testing.

3. **SYSU-CD**: This dataset is noted for its variety of changes, including road expansion and vegetation changes. It contains 20000 pairs of high-resolution images with a spatial resolution of 0.5m and also specifies the division into training, validation, and test sets.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. However, since these datasets are likely to be publicly available and may not have specific citations in the references, I will note the details provided in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information for each dataset, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and any relevant details such as the number of images, resolution, and how the dataset is divided.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the citations or references are accurately noted where applicable.
