To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MaPa: Text-driven Photorealistic Material Painting for 3D Shapes" by Tao Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses generating materials for 3D meshes and mentions leveraging a pre-trained 2D diffusion model, but it does not explicitly name any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the challenges in 3D content generation but still lacks specific dataset references.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In **Section 4.1 (Implementation details)**, the authors mention collecting 8 material categories, including wood, metal, plastic, leather, fabric, stone, ceramic, and rubber. However, they do not provide specific dataset names or citations here.

In **Section 4.2 (Comparison to baselines)**, the authors reference two datasets used for quantitative comparisons: the **TMT dataset** and the **ABO dataset**. I will need to find the full citations for these datasets in the **References section**.

Upon reviewing the **References section**, I find the following citations:

1. For the **TMT dataset**:
   > Hu, Y., Mo, K., Yi, L., & Su, H. (2022). *PartNet: A large-scale benchmark for fine-grained and hierarchical part-level 3D object understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (CVPR), 909–918.

2. For the **ABO dataset**:
   > Collins, J., Goel, S., Deng, K., Luthra, A., Xu, L., Arora, H., Guillaumin, M., & Malik, J. (2022). *ABO: Dataset and Benchmarks for Real-World 3D Object Understanding*. In CVPR (2022).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

The datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **TMT Dataset**: A benchmark for fine-grained and hierarchical part-level 3D object understanding.
   - Citation: Hu, Y., Mo, K., Yi, L., & Su, H. (2022). *PartNet: A large-scale benchmark for fine-grained and hierarchical part-level 3D object understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (CVPR), 909–918.

2. **ABO Dataset**: A dataset and benchmarks for real-world 3D object understanding.
   - Citation: Collins, J., Goel, S., Deng, K., Luthra, A., Xu, L., Arora, H., Guillaumin, M., & Malik, J. (2022). *ABO: Dataset and Benchmarks for Real-World 3D Object Understanding*. In CVPR (2022).

With this information gathered, I am now ready to present the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
