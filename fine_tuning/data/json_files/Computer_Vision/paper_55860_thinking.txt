To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatial Moment Pooling Improves Neural Image Assessment" by Tongda Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions improvements in CNN-based blind image quality assessment (IQA) methods, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, the authors mention using two types of datasets for blind IQA: large-scale natural datasets without reference images and small-scale synthetic datasets with reference images.

1. **Koniq-10k**: This is identified as a large-scale dataset used for blind IQA. The authors mention that it is ecologically valid for deep learning applications in this domain.

2. **LIVE**: This dataset is mentioned as a small-scale synthetic dataset that includes reference images and distortion information. It is commonly used in the field of image quality assessment.

3. **CSIQ**: Another small-scale dataset referenced in the context of evaluating the performance of their proposed methods.

In the **references section**, I will look for the full citations of these datasets to ensure proper attribution:

- For **Koniq-10k**, the citation is:
  > Vlad Hosu, Hanhe Lin, Tamas Sziranyi, and Dietmar Saupe. "Koniq-10k: An ecologically valid database for deep learning of blind image quality assessment." *IEEE Trans Image Process*, vol. 29, pp. 4041–4056, 2020.

- For **LIVE**, the citation is:
  > Hamid R Sheikh, Muhammad F Sabir, and Alan C Bovik. "A statistical evaluation of recent full reference image quality assessment algorithms." *IEEE Trans Image Process*, vol. 15, no. 11, pp. 3440–3451, 2006.

- For **CSIQ**, the citation is:
  > Eric Cooper Larson and Damon Michael Chandler. "Most apparent distortion: full-reference image quality assessment and the role of strategy." *Journal of Electronic Imaging*, vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 011006, 2010.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
