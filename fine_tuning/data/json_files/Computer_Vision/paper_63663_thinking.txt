To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real World Time Series Benchmark Datasets with Distribution Shifts" by Pranay Pasula, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract indicates the introduction of the **COB (Crude Oil Benchmark)** datasets, which suggests that there are specific datasets related to crude oil prices.

Next, I will look into **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the author discusses the importance of benchmarks in AI and mentions the three primary global crude oil price markers: **West Texas Intermediate (WTI)**, **Brent Blend**, and **Dubai Crude**. This section confirms that these datasets are significant for the research.

I will then proceed to **section 4 (Datasets)**, where the author provides detailed descriptions of the datasets. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Crude Oil Daily Spot Price**: This dataset contains daily spot prices for WTI crude oil, which is a key benchmark in the U.S. oil market.

2. **Brent Crude Oil Daily Spot Price**: This dataset includes daily spot prices for Brent crude oil, which is widely used as a global benchmark.

3. **Dubai Crude Oil Monthly Average Price**: This dataset consists of monthly average prices for Dubai crude oil, which is another important benchmark in the oil market.

In **section 5 (Experimental Design and Results)**, the author discusses how these datasets are utilized in experiments, further confirming their relevance.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **West Texas Intermediate (WTI)**, the citation is:
  > U.S. EIA. Crude oil prices: West Texas Intermediate (WTI) - Cushing, Oklahoma, Sep 2022. Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration. Retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

- For **Brent Crude**, the citation is:
  > U.S. EIA. Crude oil prices: Brent - Europe [DCOILBRENT], Sep 2022. Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration. Retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

- For **Dubai Crude**, the citation is:
  > IMF. Global price of Dubai crude [POILDUBUSDM], Aug 2022. Source: International Monetary Fund. Retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their corresponding references as required.
