To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EDDense-Net: Fully Dense Encoder Decoder Network for Joint Segmentation of Optic Cup and Disc" by Mehwish Mehmood et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the proposed method was evaluated on two publicly available datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Databases and Performance Metrics)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Drishti-GS**: This dataset consists of 101 retinal images taken at a 30-degree field of view, annotated by an expert from Aravind Eye Clinic. The images are in PNG format with a resolution of 2896 × 1944.

2. **RIM-ONE**: This dataset contains 159 retinal images, with 74 images from glaucoma-affected eyes and 85 from healthy individuals. The images were collected from three Spanish hospitals and graded by two experts.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Drishti-GS**, the citation is:
  > J. Sivaswamy, S. Krishnadas, A. Chakravarty, G. Joshi, A. S. Tabish, et al. *A comprehensive retinal image dataset for the assessment of glaucoma from the optic nerve head analysis*. JSM Biomedical Imaging Data Papers, 2(1), 1004, 2015.

- For **RIM-ONE**, the citation is:
  > F. Fumero, S. Alayón, J. L. Sanchez, J. Sigut, M. Gonzalez-Hernandez. *Rim-one: An open retinal image database for optic nerve evaluation*. In Proceedings of the 2011 24th International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS), IEEE, 2011, pp. 1–6.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
