To extract datasets from the research paper titled "StyleCity: Large-Scale 3D Urban Scenes Stylization" by Yingshu Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a stylization system for large-scale urban scenes, which may imply the use of specific datasets for evaluation or training.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments and methodologies in detail, which often includes the datasets used.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention using **Google 3D Tiles API** to collect urban scene models for their experiments. This indicates that they utilized a specific dataset or resource for their work.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Google 3D Tiles API. The citation is as follows:
> Google Maps. (2023). Google Maps Tile API Documentation. Retrieved from https://developers.google.com/maps/tile/api/documentation/tile/

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper. The authors may refer to other datasets or resources in the context of their methodology or related work sections.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations. In this case, the primary dataset extracted is the Google 3D Tiles API.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for clarity and proper attribution.
