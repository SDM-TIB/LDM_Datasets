To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tackling Multimodal Device Distributions in Inverse Photonic Design using Invertible Neural Networks" by Michel Frising et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a general overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses previous work and may reference datasets used in those studies.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, as it typically contains detailed descriptions of the experimental setup, including any datasets used for training or validation. In this paper, the authors mention generating a training set of **60,000 different structures**, which indicates that a dataset is involved. I will look for specifics about how this dataset was created, including any references to existing datasets or simulations.

In the **results section**, the authors may discuss the performance of their model on specific datasets or provide comparisons with other methods. This section can also confirm the datasets used in their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

From my reading, I note the following datasets:

1. **Training Set of 60,000 Structures**: This dataset was generated using a Coupled Mode Theory (CMT) framework and is divided into 45,000 structures for training and 15,000 for validation. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset since it is generated by the authors.

2. **CMT Framework**: The authors mention using the CMT framework extensively for simulating transmission phenomena. The relevant citation for this framework is:
   > Bravo-Abad, J.; Martín-Moreno, L.; García-Vidal, F. J. Resonant Transmission of Light Through Subwavelength Holes in Thick Metal Films. *IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics* 2006, 12 (6), 1221–1227. https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2006.881640.

3. **Supporting Literature**: The authors reference various studies that may have datasets relevant to their work, such as those involving generative models and inverse design. For example, they cite:
   > Ma, W.; Cheng, F.; Xu, Y.; Wen, Q.; Liu, Y. Probabilistic Representation and Inverse Design of Metamaterials Based on a Deep Generative Model with Semi-Supervised Learning Strategy. *Advanced Materials* 2019, 31 (35), 1901111. https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.201901111.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include full citations for any referenced datasets or frameworks. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
