To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Devil is in the Pose: Ambiguity-free 3D Rotation-invariant Learning via Pose-aware Convolution" by Ronghan Chen and Yang Cong, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention that they conducted extensive experiments on three datasets: **ModelNet40**, **ShapeNetPart**, and **ScanObjectNN**. I will take note of these datasets and look for specific details about each one.

For each dataset, I will gather the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details such as the number of samples or categories.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete citation for each dataset, which is crucial for proper attribution.

Now, I will look for the full citations in the **References section** of the paper. Here are the citations I will extract:

1. **ModelNet40**: 
   > Wu, Zhirong, et al. "3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shapes." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 1912–1920, 2015.

2. **ShapeNetPart**: 
   > Yi, Li, et al. "A Scalable Active Framework for Region Annotation in 3D Shape Collections." ACM Transactions on Graphics (ToG), 35(6):1–12, 2016.

3. **ScanObjectNN**: 
   > Uy, Mikaela Angelina, et al. "Revisiting Point Cloud Classification: A New Benchmark Dataset and Classification Model on Real-World Data." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 1588–1597, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its description and citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work.
