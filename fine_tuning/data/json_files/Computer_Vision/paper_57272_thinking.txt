To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Myth of Culturally Agnostic AI Models" by Eva Cetinic, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and main body of the paper** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on sections where datasets are likely to be discussed in detail, such as the methodology or results sections.

In the paper, the author discusses two prominent text-to-image synthesis models: **DALL·E 2** and **Stable Diffusion**. The mention of these models suggests that there are datasets associated with their training and evaluation.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the text. The author references the **LAION dataset**, which is crucial for the Stable Diffusion model. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its purpose and characteristics.

The paper states that the LAION dataset is openly available for exploration and is used to train the Stable Diffusion model. This indicates that it is a significant dataset in the context of the research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the LAION dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **LAION-400M Dataset**: 
  > Schuhmann, Christoph, et al. "Laion-400m: Open dataset of clip-filtered 400 million image-text pairs." arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.02114 (2021). https://laion.ai/blog/laion-400-open-dataset/

Additionally, I will note that while the paper discusses DALL·E 2, it does not provide a specific dataset name for its training data, as it mentions that the dataset is unpublished and filtered. However, I will still acknowledge the significance of DALL·E 2 in the context of the research.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the findings:

1. **LAION Dataset**: Used for training the Stable Diffusion model, openly available for exploration.

Now, I will prepare to create structured entries for the datasets identified, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the context of the research paper.
