To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Social network analytics for supervised fraud detection in insurance" by María Óskarsdóttir et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and the datasets section** to locate any explicit mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on fraud detection using social network analytics, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Insurance fraud dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used in their study. Here, they mention analyzing a dataset containing a couple of million claims filed by an insurance company over several years. This section is crucial as it provides detailed information about the dataset's characteristics.

In this section, the authors describe the dataset as follows:

1. **Insurance Claims Dataset**: This dataset includes claims filed by policyholders, containing information such as claim amounts, policyholder demographics, and claims history. The dataset is used to build a fraud detection model specifically for motor insurance.

The authors also discuss the features available in the dataset, which are intrinsic to the claims and relevant for the fraud detection model. However, they do not provide a specific name for the dataset, referring to it simply as the "insurance claims dataset."

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, since the dataset is proprietary and specific to the insurance company, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is not publicly cited but is derived from the insurance company's internal records.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset description and any relevant citations, even if they are not traditional references.

In summary, I will document the following dataset:

- **Insurance Claims Dataset**: A dataset containing millions of claims filed by policyholders, used for fraud detection in motor insurance. No formal citation is available as it is proprietary to the insurance company.

This process will ensure that I accurately capture the dataset information as presented in the paper while adhering to the importance of proper citation.
