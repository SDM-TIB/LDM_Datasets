To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Plug-and-Play Methods for Integrating Physical and Learned Models in Computational Imaging" by Ulugbek S. Kamilov et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. This is where authors typically describe the datasets they used for their experiments. If there is a section explicitly labeled "Datasets," I will focus on that.

In this paper, I will pay special attention to any references to specific datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. For example, if the authors mention using datasets for MRI or tomography, I will note the specific names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For instance, if the paper mentions using a dataset like "DeCoLearn" for MRI reconstruction, I will look for the original paper or source that describes this dataset to provide a complete citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all citations are complete and correctly formatted.
