To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Aligning Coarse-to-Fine Cognition and Affection for Empathetic Response Generation" by Jinfeng Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of empathetic dialogue and reference existing works, but I need to look for specific datasets. The **experimental setup section** is crucial as it typically details the datasets used for evaluation.

Upon reaching **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, the authors explicitly mention that they conducted experiments on the **EMPATHETICDIALOGUES dataset**, which comprises 25,000 open-domain conversations. This dataset is central to their evaluation, and I will note its details.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the EMPATHETICDIALOGUES dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Hannah Rashkin, Eric Michael Smith, Margaret Li, and Y-Lan Boureau. *Towards empathetic open-domain conversation models: A new benchmark and dataset*. In Proceedings of the 57th Conference of the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL 2019, Florence, Italy, July 28- August 2, 2019, Volume 1: Long Papers, pages 5370–5381. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: EMPATHETICDIALOGUES
   - **Description**: A dataset comprising 25,000 open-domain conversations where speakers confide personal experiences, and listeners infer the situation and emotion of the speaker to respond empathetically.
   - **Citation**: Hannah Rashkin, Eric Michael Smith, Margaret Li, and Y-Lan Boureau. *Towards empathetic open-domain conversation models: A new benchmark and dataset*. In Proceedings of the 57th Conference of the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL 2019, Florence, Italy, July 28- August 2, 2019, Volume 1: Long Papers, pages 5370–5381. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and citation.
