To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Robust Interpretability with Self-Explaining Neural Networks" by David Alvarez-Melis and Tommi S. Jaakkola, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of interpretability in machine learning and mention that they evaluate their models on various benchmark datasets. This indicates that datasets are likely to be detailed in the experiments section.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. They mention three classification settings:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition.
2. **UCI Datasets**: A collection of datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which includes various datasets for different tasks.
3. **COMPAS Recidivism Risk Score Dataset**: This dataset contains demographic features labeled with criminal recidivism risk scores, which are used in the criminal justice system.

In the **methods section**, the authors provide additional context about the datasets, particularly the COMPAS dataset, which has been a subject of scrutiny regarding fairness and bias in machine learning.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

- For **UCI Datasets**, the citation is:
  > M. Lichman and K. Bache. *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. 2013. [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml)

- For **COMPAS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > ProPublica. *Machine Bias*. 2016. [https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
