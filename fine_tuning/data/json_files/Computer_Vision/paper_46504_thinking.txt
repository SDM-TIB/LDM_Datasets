To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-supervised Pre-training with Hard Examples Improves Visual Representations" by Chunyuan Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their methods on "multiple public benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they mention that they pre-train models on **ImageNet** and evaluate them on various public benchmarks. This indicates that **ImageNet** is a primary dataset used in their experiments.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the context of specific experiments or evaluations. The authors refer to evaluating their models on **PASCAL VOC2007**, **CIFAR10**, and **CIFAR100** datasets, which are commonly used benchmarks in computer vision tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **ImageNet**: The citation is:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In CVPR, 2009.

2. **PASCAL VOC2007**: The citation is:
   > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The pascal visual object classes (VOC) challenge*. IJCV, 2010.

3. **CIFAR10**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

4. **CIFAR100**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. Each dataset will be documented with its name, description, and full citation to ensure clarity and proper attribution.
