To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding the (un)interpretability of natural image distributions using generative models" by Ryen Krusinga et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses generative models and their application to image distributions, which may hint at the datasets used for training these models.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to identify any specific datasets referenced. The authors mention using GANs and refer to datasets like MNIST and CIFAR, which are commonly used in generative modeling research.

In the **methods section**, I will look for any detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. The authors explicitly state that they trained their GAN on the **MNIST dataset** and the **CIFAR dataset**. They mention scaling the MNIST dataset to a size of 32 × 32 × 3 to facilitate experiments alongside CIFAR.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 2010. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

2. For the **CIFAR dataset**, the citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
