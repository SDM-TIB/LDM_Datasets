To extract datasets from the research paper titled "InvAASTCluster: On Applying Invariant-Based Program Clustering to Introductory Programming Assignments" by Pedro Orvalho et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, which can guide me in identifying them.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors describe their evaluation on a set of introductory programming assignments (IPAs) and mention the number of correct and incorrect submissions. Specifically, I will focus on the section that discusses the dataset used for experiments, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors present a dataset of IPAs in **Table 1**. This table summarizes the number of correct and incorrect submissions across various labs, which is crucial information for my extraction.

The datasets identified are:

1. **C-Pack-IPAs Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1620 correct submissions and 196 incorrect submissions collected from 25 different programming exercises. The authors mention that this dataset is publicly available on GitHub.

2. **ITSP Dataset**: This dataset includes 202 correct submissions and 224 incorrect submissions across 23 different programming exercises. The authors also provide a reference to this dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **C-Pack-IPAs Dataset**, the citation is:
> Orvalho, P., Janota, M., & Manquinho, V. (2022). C-Pack of IPAs: A C90 Program Benchmark of Introductory Programming Assignments. Retrieved from https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2206.08768

For the **ITSP Dataset**, the citation is:
> Yi, J., Ahmed, U. Z., Karkare, A., Tan, S. H., & Roychoudhury, A. (2017). A feasibility study of using automated program repair for introductory programming assignments. In ESEC/FSE 2017 (pp. 740-751). ACM.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its respective citation, ready for inclusion in any structured output or further analysis.
