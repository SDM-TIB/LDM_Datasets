To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Image retrieval outperforms diffusion models on data augmentation" by Max F. Burg et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions the use of "Laion 5b" for retrieval, which indicates that this dataset is significant to the study.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used in the experiments. The **experimental protocol** section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets. In this section, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **ImageNet**: The paper discusses using a 10% sample of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2012 (ILSVRC2012) for their experiments. This dataset is crucial for benchmarking the augmentation techniques.

2. **Caltech256**: The authors also mention using the Caltech256 dataset to verify their findings, which consists of 256 object categories.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., Berg, A. C., & Fei-Fei, L. (2015). *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3), 211-252. doi:10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y.

- For **Caltech256**, the citation is:
  > Griffin, G., Holub, A., & Perona, P. (2007). *Caltech-256 Object Category Dataset*. 

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets relevant to the research and their proper citations, which is essential for any downstream applications or analyses.
