To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GEOLAB: Geometry-Based Tractography Parcellation of Superficial White Matter" by Nabil Vindas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information and provide full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a method designed for the SWM atlas of EBRAINS, which suggests that there is a dataset involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for studying short-range white matter connections and mention the use of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to produce tractograms. This indicates that datasets related to dMRI are likely to be referenced.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.1 (Datasets and preprocessing)**, where the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Extended Short Bundles Atlas (ESBA)**: This atlas is built from the HCP database and contains 657 short white matter bundles. It is proposed by the European EBRAINS infrastructure and is noted for its comprehensive nature in terms of short-bundle atlases.

2. **ARCHI dataset**: This dataset consists of 76 subjects aligned to MNI space, used for semi-ground truth evaluation. The authors mention that the tractograms were produced using a streamline-regularized deterministic tractography method.

Additionally, they mention using the **UK Biobank dataset** for experimental evaluation without ground truth, which includes 100 subjects aged 48 to 78.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **HCP database**, the citation is:
  > David C. Van Essen, Stephen M. Smith, Deanna M. Barch, Timothy E.J. Behrens, Essa Yacoub, and Kamil Ugurbil. *The wu-minn human connectome project: An overview*. NeuroImage, vol. 80, pp. 62–79, 2013.

- For the **ARCHI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Schmitt B., Lebois A., Duclap D., Guevara P., Poupon F., Rivière D., et al. *Connect/archi: an open database to infer atlases of the human brain connectivity*. In 29th Annual Scientific Meeting of the European Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine and Biology, ESMRMB 2012.

- For the **UK Biobank dataset**, the citation is:
  > UK Biobank. *UK Biobank: Protocol for a large-scale prospective study of the health of the UK population*. Available at: https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a clear understanding of the datasets used in the research and their relevance to the study's findings.
