To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Image Watermarking using Stable Diffusion" by Lijun Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method on three benchmarks: **MS-COCO**, **DiffusionDB**, and **WikiArt**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to gather more details about these datasets. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly list the datasets used:

1. **MS-COCO**: The authors state that they randomly selected 500 images from this dataset, which contains over 328K captioned images. This dataset is widely known in the computer vision community.

2. **DiffusionDB**: This dataset consists of images generated by Stable Diffusion based on prompts and hyperparameters from actual user interactions. The authors also mention that they randomly chose 500 images from this dataset.

3. **WikiArt**: The authors sampled 500 images from this dataset, which includes various art pieces sourced from WikiArt.org.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MS-COCO**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). Microsoft coco: Common objects in context. In *Computer Vision–ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V 13* (pp. 740–755). Springer.

- For **DiffusionDB**, the citation is:
  > Wang, Z. J., Montoya, E., Munechika, D., Yang, H., Hoover, B., & Chau, D. H. (2022). DiffusionDB: A large-scale prompt gallery dataset for text-to-image generative models. arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.14896.

- For **WikiArt**, the citation is:
  > Phillips, F., & Mackintosh, B. (2011). Wiki art gallery, inc.: A case for critical thinking. *Issues in Accounting Education*, 26(3), 593–608.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help in organizing the datasets effectively for further analysis or processing.
