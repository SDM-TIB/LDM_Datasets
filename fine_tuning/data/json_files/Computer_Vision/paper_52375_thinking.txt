To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Region Proposal Rectification Towards Robust Instance Segmentation of Biological Images" by Qilong Zhangli et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method is evaluated on three biological image datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiment)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they describe three datasets:

1. **Urothelial Cell Dataset**: This dataset consists of 336 pathological images with a resolution of 1024 × 1024, cropped from ThinPrep slide images and annotated by three experts.

2. **Plant Phenotyping Dataset**: This dataset contains 535 top-down view plant leaf images with various resolutions. The reference to this dataset suggests it may have a citation or further details in the references section.

3. **DSB2018 Dataset**: The Data Science Bowl 2018 dataset consists of 670 annotated cell nuclei images of different sizes. The authors provide a link to the dataset, which is hosted on Kaggle.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The Plant Phenotyping dataset is referenced as follows:

- For the **Plant Phenotyping Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Minervini, M., Fischbach, A., Scharr, H., Tsaftaris, S.A. (2016). *Finely-grained annotated datasets for image-based plant phenotyping*. Pattern Recognition Letters, 81, 80–89.

The DSB2018 dataset is mentioned with a link, but it does not have a formal citation in the references. However, I can note the link provided in the paper for completeness.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations:

1. **Urothelial Cell Dataset**: Contains 336 pathological images with a resolution of 1024 × 1024, annotated by experts.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided in the paper.

2. **Plant Phenotyping Dataset**: Contains 535 top-down view plant leaf images with various resolutions.
   - Citation: Minervini, M., Fischbach, A., Scharr, H., Tsaftaris, S.A. (2016). *Finely-grained annotated datasets for image-based plant phenotyping*. Pattern Recognition Letters, 81, 80–89.

3. **DSB2018 Dataset**: Consists of 670 annotated cell nuclei images of different sizes.
   - Citation: Data Science Bowl 2018. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the details and citations for each dataset, ready for further processing or review.
