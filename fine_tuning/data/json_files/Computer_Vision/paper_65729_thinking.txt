To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Low-Rank Latent Spaces with Simple Deterministic Autoencoder: Theoretical and Empirical Insights" by Alokendu Mazumder et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of effective representations in artificial intelligence and mention various autoencoder techniques. However, I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention using the **MNIST** and **CelebA** datasets for their experiments. 

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The authors state that they used the MNIST dataset for classification tasks. This dataset consists of handwritten digits and is widely used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

2. **CelebA Dataset**: The authors also mention using the CelebA dataset, which contains celebrity images with various attributes annotated. This dataset is commonly used for tasks involving image generation and representation learning.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 2010. [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

- For the **CelebA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3730â€“3738, 2015. 

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper.
