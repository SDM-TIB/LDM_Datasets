To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fisher GAN" by Youssef Mroueh and Tom Sercu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for validation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for specific mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation. The authors typically describe the datasets in detail, including their characteristics, size, and any relevant splits (e.g., training, validation, test).

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention three benchmark datasets used for their experiments:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A widely used dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.

2. **LSUN**: A large-scale dataset for scene understanding, which includes various categories of images.

3. **CelebA**: A dataset containing over 200,000 celebrity images, each annotated with 40 attribute labels.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I find are:

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Master's thesis, 2009.

- For **LSUN**:
  > Fisher Yu, Ari Seff, Yinda Zhang, Shuran Song, Thomas Funkhouser, and Jianxiong Xiao. *LSUN: Construction of a Large-Scale Image Dataset Using Deep Learning with Humans in the Loop*. arXiv:1506.03365, 2015.

- For **CelebA**:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 558â€“567, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for each dataset.
