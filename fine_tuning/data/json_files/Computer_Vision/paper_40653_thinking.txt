To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recon-GLGAN: A Global-Local context based Generative Adversarial Network for MRI Reconstruction" by Balamurali Murugesan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, I find that in **section 3.1 (Dataset)**, the authors mention the **Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC)** dataset, which is crucial for their experiments. They provide specific details about the dataset, including the number of patient records, the number of 2D slice images extracted, and the dimensions of these images.

The authors state that the dataset has **150 training and 50 testing patient records**, with a total of **1841 training slices and 1076 testing slices**. They also mention that the slices are normalized and that the images are used for MRI reconstruction tasks.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the ACDC dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Bernard, O., Lalande, A., Zotti, C., Cervenansky, F., et al. "Deep learning techniques for automatic MRI cardiac multi-structures segmentation and diagnosis: Is the problem solved?" *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 37(11), 2514â€“2525, Nov 2018.

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the dataset details and ensure that I include the full citation for the ACDC dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ensuring that all relevant information is included for clarity and completeness.
