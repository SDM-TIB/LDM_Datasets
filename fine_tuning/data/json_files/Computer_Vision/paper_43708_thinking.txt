To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Abnormality Detection Using Heterogeneous Autonomous Systems" by Sayeed Shafayet Chowdhury et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their method on the **IEEE SP Cup 2020 dataset** and an **in-house dataset**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will examine **section II (Problem and Dataset Description)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. They mention that the **IEEE SP Cup 2020 dataset** consists of data from an unmanned drone, including IMU sensor data and images. They specify that there are 12 Rosbag files, with a total of 277 normal images and 392 mixed images. This section confirms the dataset's structure and purpose.

Additionally, the authors describe the **in-house dataset** used for validation, but they do not provide specific details about it. I will note that while the in-house dataset is mentioned, it lacks a formal citation or detailed description.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citation for the **IEEE SP Cup 2020 dataset**. The reference is provided as:
> "Unsupervised abnormality detection by using heterogeneous autonomous systems," IEEE ICASSP 2020. Available: https://2020.ieeeicassp.org/authors/sp-cup-2020/. [Accessed: 23-Mar-2020].

Since the in-house dataset does not have a formal citation, I will only include the IEEE SP Cup 2020 dataset in my final output.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the IEEE SP Cup 2020 dataset. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
