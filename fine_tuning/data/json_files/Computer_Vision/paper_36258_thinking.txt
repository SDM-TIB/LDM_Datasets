To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SIMILARnet: Simultaneous Intelligent Localization and Recognition Network" by Arna Ghosh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the experiments were conducted on the **MNIST dataset**, which is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit classification. This is a clear indication that I need to gather more details about this dataset.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** to confirm the dataset's usage and gather additional context. In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they used the **MNIST handwritten digits dataset** for their experiments. They provide details about the training set (60,000 images) and the test set (10,000 images), which further confirms the dataset's relevance.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is widely cited, and I know that the original citation is:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 2010. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will focus solely on the MNIST dataset for my extraction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the necessary details, including the full citation, ensuring that it is ready for downstream processing or review. This structured approach allows me to systematically extract and document the dataset information from the research paper.
