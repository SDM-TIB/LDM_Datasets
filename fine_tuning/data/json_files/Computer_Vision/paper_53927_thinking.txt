To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Unlearning: Reducing Confidence Along Adversarial Directions" by Amrith Setlur et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the method was evaluated on "many classification benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look closely at the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention using **six image classification benchmarks**, specifically naming:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images.
3. **SVHN**: The Street View House Numbers dataset, which consists of over 600,000 labeled digits.
4. **Tiny ImageNet**: A smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 200 classes with 500 training images per class.
5. **Penn Action Dataset**: A dataset for action recognition in videos.
6. **sub-JHMDB Dataset**: A subset of the JHMDB dataset, used for pose estimation in videos.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, the citation for **CIFAR-10** is:
> Alex Krizhevsky et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

The citation for **SVHN** is:
> Y. Netzer et al. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. 2011.

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations for future reference.
