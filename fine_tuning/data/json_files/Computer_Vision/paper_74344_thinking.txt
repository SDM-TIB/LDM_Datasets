To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DiffPoGAN: Diffusion Policies with Generative Adversarial Networks for Offline Reinforcement Learning" by Xuemin Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that comprehensive experiments were conducted on datasets for deep data-driven reinforcement learning (D4RL), which suggests that specific datasets are used.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 5.1, the authors mention evaluating their method on the **D4RL benchmark** with two different domains: **Gym-MuJoCo** and **Antmaze**. They specify that Gym-MuJoCo includes three locomotion tasks: **Walker2d-v2**, **Hopper-v2**, and **HalfCheetah-v2**, each with three datasets: medium, medium-expert, and medium-replay. This gives me a clear indication of the datasets involved.

I will also check for any additional details about the datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors provide a table (Table 1) that lists the performance of their method on various datasets, confirming the presence of the following datasets:

1. **Walker2d-v2**: This dataset includes data collected from a single sub-optimal policy.
2. **Hopper-v2**: Similar to Walker2d-v2, this dataset consists of data from a sub-optimal policy.
3. **HalfCheetah-v2**: This dataset also follows the same structure as the previous two.
4. **Antmaze**: This domain includes various tasks representing mazes of different sizes and complexities.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the D4RL benchmark, which is crucial for understanding the datasets used:

- For **D4RL**, the citation is:
  > Justin Fu, Aviral Kumar, Ofir Nachum, George Tucker, and Sergey Levine. *D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219, 2020.

Next, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or processing.
