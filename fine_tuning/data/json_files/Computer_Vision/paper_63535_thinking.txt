To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "An Interpretable Machine Learning Model with Deep Learning-based Imaging Biomarkers for Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease" by Wenjie Kang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions validation on the **Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is significant for the study.

Next, in the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of diagnosing Alzheimer’s Disease and mention the use of machine learning methods on high-dimensional imaging data. They refer to the **ADNI dataset** again, confirming its importance in their research.

In **section 2.1 (Study population)**, the authors provide more details about the **ADNI dataset**, specifying that they included data from 855 participants, including 335 AD patients and 520 control participants. This section also mentions a second dataset, the **Health-RI Parelsnoer Neurodegenerative Diseases Biobank (PND)**, which includes 336 participants, 198 of whom are AD patients.

In the **results section**, the authors validate their model using both datasets, confirming their relevance to the study's findings.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **ADNI dataset**, the citation is:
   > Jack, C.R., Bernstein, M.A., Fox, N.C., et al. *The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI): MRI methods.* NeuroImage 2008; 41(1): 1-6.

2. For the **Health-RI Parelsnoer Neurodegenerative Diseases Biobank (PND)**, the citation is:
   > Aalten, P., Ramakers, I.H., Biessels, G.J., et al. *The Dutch Parelsnoer Institute-Neurodegenerative Diseases; methods, design and baseline results.* BMC Neurology 2014; 14(1): 1-8.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation to ensure proper attribution.
