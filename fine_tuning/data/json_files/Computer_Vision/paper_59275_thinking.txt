To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Monitoring Efficiency of IoT Wireless Charging" by Pengwei Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors collected a "real wireless energy dataset" to train their machine learning models, which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, specifically the part labeled **Wireless Energy Transfer Dataset Collection**. Here, the authors describe how they collected their dataset, which consists of 450 data points with five attributes: distance between the coils, charging duration, and battery levels of both the consumer and provider. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's structure and the context in which it was collected.

I will also look for any specific names or titles associated with the dataset. In this case, the dataset is referred to simply as the "wireless energy transfer dataset," but it is important to note that it was collected using an app developed by another referenced study (Yang et al., 2022). This indicates that the dataset is tied to a specific application and methodology.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the paper that describes the app used for data collection. The relevant citation is:

- For the app developed by Yang et al.:
  > P. Yang, A. Abusaﬁa, A. Lakhdari, and A. Bouguettaya. *Towards peer-to-peer sharing of wireless energy services*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing (ICSOC), Springer, 2022.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its context, I will compile the information into a structured format. The dataset is a real wireless energy transfer dataset collected during experiments involving energy sharing between IoT devices, specifically smartphones.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the full citation for the dataset's source, which is critical for proper attribution in any subsequent analysis or reporting.

In summary, I have identified the dataset as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: Wireless Energy Transfer Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset consisting of 450 data points with attributes including distance between coils, charging duration, and battery levels of both consumer and provider.
- **Full Citation**: P. Yang, A. Abusaﬁa, A. Lakhdari, and A. Bouguettaya. *Towards peer-to-peer sharing of wireless energy services*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing (ICSOC), Springer, 2022.

With this information, I am now ready to create the dataset entry in the required format for further processing or review.
