To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GRIT-VLP: Grouped Mini-batch Sampling for Efficient Vision and Language Pre-training" by Jaeseok Byun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors use "four datasets (MS-COCO, Visual Genome, Conceptual Captions, and SBU Captions) for training," which indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experimental setup**. In the **experimental results section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used for training and evaluation. They specifically mention:

1. **MS-COCO**: A widely used dataset for image captioning and image-text retrieval tasks.
2. **Visual Genome**: A dataset that provides dense annotations of images, useful for various vision and language tasks.
3. **Conceptual Captions**: A dataset that consists of image-caption pairs, aimed at improving image captioning models.
4. **SBU Captions**: A dataset containing image-caption pairs, often used for training models in vision and language tasks.

I will then check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers who may want to use these datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **MS-COCO**:
  > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., DollÃ¡r, P., Zitnick, C.L. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

- **Visual Genome**:
  > Krishna, R., Zhu, Y., Groth, O., Johnson, J., Hata, K., Kravitz, J., Chen, S., Kalantidis, Y., Li, L.J., Shamma, D.A. (2017). *Visual Genome: Connecting Language and Vision Using Crowdsourced Dense Image Annotations*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 2017.

- **Conceptual Captions**:
  > Sharma, P., Ding, N., Goodman, S., Soricut, R. (2018). *Conceptual Captions: A Cleaned, Hypernymed, Image Alt-Text Dataset for Automatic Image Captioning*. In Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2018.

- **SBU Captions**:
  > Ordonez, V., Kulkarni, G., Berg, T. (2011). *Im2Text: Describing Images Using 1 Million Captioned Photographs*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2011.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced accurately in future work.
