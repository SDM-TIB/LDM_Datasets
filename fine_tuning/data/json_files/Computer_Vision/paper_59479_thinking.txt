To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bidirectional Domain Mixup for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation" by Daehan Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of domain adaptation techniques and mentions the evaluation of their method on specific datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely to be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets: **GTA5** and **SYNTHIA**. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics, the number of images, and any relevant information about their use in the experiments.

In the **experimental settings section**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets:
1. **GTA5**: This dataset consists of 24,966 urban scene images collected from the video game Grand Theft Auto V. It is used as the source domain for training.
2. **SYNTHIA**: This dataset includes 9,400 images from the SYNTHIA-RAND-CITYSCAPES subset, which shares 16 semantic classes with the Cityscapes dataset. It is also used as a source domain for training.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I find are:
- For **GTA5**:
  > Richter, S. R., Vineet, V., Roth, S., & Koltun, V. (2016). Playing for data: Ground truth from computer games. In *European Conference on Computer Vision* (pp. 102-118). Springer.

- For **SYNTHIA**:
  > Ros, G., Sellart, L., Materzynska, J., Vazquez, D., & Lopez, A. M. (2016). The SYNTHIA dataset: A large collection of synthetic images for semantic segmentation of urban scenes. In *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition* (pp. 3234-3243).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the datasets are clearly documented and easily accessible for future reference.
