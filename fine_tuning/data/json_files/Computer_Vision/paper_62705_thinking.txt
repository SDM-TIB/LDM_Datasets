To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SAMMed: A medical image annotation framework based on large vision model" by Chenglong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not list specific datasets, it sets the context for the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. This section typically contains detailed information about each dataset, including its name, modality, target tissue, and the number of cases.

In this paper, the authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **Kidney Tumor Segmentation Challenge (KiTS)**: This dataset is used for segmenting kidney tumors in CT images and consists of 210 cases.
2. **CT2US for Kidney Segmentation**: This dataset contains 4586 ultrasound images of kidneys.
3. **The Liver Tumor Segmentation Benchmark (LiTS)**: This dataset includes 131 CT images with liver tumors.
4. **CT Volumes with Multiple Organ Segmentations (CT-ORG)**: This dataset consists of CT images with multiple organ segmentations, totaling 346 cases.
5. **PROSTATEx Challenges**: This dataset includes 40 MRI images for prostate segmentation.
6. **Medical Segmentation Decathlon**: This dataset encompasses 238 cases across various modalities.
7. **Colonic Nuclear Instance Segmentation (Lizard)**: This dataset contains 30 histopathology images for nuclear segmentation.
8. **Spinal Cord Grey Matter Segmentation Challenge**: This dataset includes 41 MRI images for spinal cord segmentation.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
