To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepSphere: Efficient spherical Convolutional Neural Network with HEALPix sampling for cosmological applications" by Nathanaël Perraudin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of DeepSphere to analyze cosmological data, which suggests that datasets related to cosmological observations may be included.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention various cosmological observables and models. They refer to "weak lensing mass maps from two cosmological models," indicating that these maps are likely datasets used in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for specific mentions of datasets. The authors describe the use of "convergence maps" generated from N-body simulations of two parameter sets of the ΛCDM cosmological model. This indicates that the datasets are derived from simulations, and I will need to extract the details about these datasets.

The paper mentions the creation of "whole sky N-body simulations" for two cosmological models with specific parameters (Ωm and σ8). I will note these models as datasets.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant datasets are:

1. **Weak Lensing Mass Maps**: The authors generated these maps from N-body simulations. While the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset, it references the simulation method used (L-PICOLA) and the cosmological models.

2. **N-body Simulations**: The simulations are based on the L-PICOLA code, which is mentioned in the paper. The citation for this code is:
   > Howlett, C., Manera, M., Percival, W. J. (2015). L-PICOLA: A parallel code for fast dark matter simulation. *Astronomy and Computing*, 12, 109-126.

3. **Cosmological Models**: The specific models used are described in the paper, but they do not have a separate citation. However, they are based on standard cosmological parameters commonly referenced in cosmology literature.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for any datasets or methods referenced in the paper. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
