To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Single Image LDR to HDR Conversion Using Conditional Diffusion" by Dwip Dalal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any mention of datasets used for evaluation or experiments. 

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that might be used in the context of HDR imaging or LDR to HDR conversion. The authors may mention specific datasets that are commonly used in this field.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and testing the proposed methods. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, including their sizes, characteristics, and any specific splits (e.g., training, validation, test).

In this paper, the authors mention two datasets: **HDR-Eye** and **HDR-REAL**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, such as the number of LDR-HDR image pairs they contain.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For the **HDR-Eye dataset**, I will look for the citation that describes its origin and any relevant details. Similarly, I will do the same for the **HDR-REAL dataset**.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further, ensuring that all citations are accurate and complete.
