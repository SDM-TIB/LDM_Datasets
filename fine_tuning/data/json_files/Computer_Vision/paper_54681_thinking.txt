To extract datasets from the research paper titled "YSLAO" by Zhenchao Jin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for validation. In this case, the authors mention conducting extensive experiments on the **COCO benchmark**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors discuss the advancements in object detection and refer to the **MS COCO benchmark**, which is a well-known dataset in the field. This section confirms that COCO is a primary dataset for their experiments.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used. The authors specify that their methods are evaluated on the **MS COCO benchmark**, which contains approximately 118,000 images for training, 5,000 for validation, and 20,000 for testing. This section provides specific details about the dataset's structure and its significance in the context of their research.

Finally, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the COCO dataset. The citation for the MS COCO dataset is as follows:
> Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., Zitnick, C.L. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision. pp. 740–755. Springer.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and citation as required.
