To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Small-Footprint Keyword Spotting with Multi-Scale Temporal Convolution" by Ximin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on the **Google Speech Command Dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look closely at the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. They specifically mention using the **Google Speech Command Dataset** to train and test their models. The dataset is described as containing about 65,000 one-second-long utterance files of 30 different keywords, which provides valuable context about its size and purpose.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Google Speech Command Dataset. The relevant citation is:
> P. Warden, “Speech commands: A dataset for limited-vocabulary speech recognition,” arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.03209, 2018.

Since the paper primarily focuses on this dataset for its experiments, I will ensure that I document it thoroughly.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will allow for clear communication of the dataset's relevance and origin in the context of the research.

After completing this process, I will have a well-documented entry for the dataset used in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
