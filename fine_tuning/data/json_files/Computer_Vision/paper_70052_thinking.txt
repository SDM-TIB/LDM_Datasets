To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3D Wavelet Diffusion Models for High-Resolution Medical Image Synthesis" by Paul Friedrich et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two publicly available datasets, which suggests that these datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **BraTS 2023 Adult Glioma**: This dataset is used for training and involves T1-weighted brain MR images. The authors describe preprocessing steps, such as clipping intensity values and normalizing the images.

2. **LIDC-IDRI**: This dataset is used for lung CT images. The authors also detail the preprocessing steps for this dataset, including clipping and resampling.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **BraTS 2023 Adult Glioma dataset**, the citation is:
  > Baid, U., et al. "The rsna-asnr-miccai brats 2021 benchmark on brain tumor segmentation and radiogenomic classification." *arXiv preprint arXiv:2107.02314* (2021).

- For the **LIDC-IDRI dataset**, the citation is:
  > III, A., et al. "The lung image database consortium (lidc) and image database resource initiative (idri): a completed reference database of lung nodules on ct scans." *Medical physics* 38(2), 915â€“931 (2011).

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **BraTS 2023 Adult Glioma**: A dataset of T1-weighted brain MR images used for brain tumor segmentation and classification.
2. **LIDC-IDRI**: A dataset of lung CT scans used for the analysis of lung nodules.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
