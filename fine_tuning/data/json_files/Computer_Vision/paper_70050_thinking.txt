To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Network for Image Compressed Sensing Coding Using Local Structural Sampling" by Wenxue Cui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention that they conducted experiments using images from the **BSDS500 dataset** and the **VOC2012 dataset**. These datasets are crucial for understanding the performance of the proposed method.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For the **BSDS500 dataset**, the citation is:
> Martin, D. R., Fowlkes, C. C., Tal, D., & Malik, J. (2001). *A Database of Human Segmented Natural Images and its Application to Evaluating Segmentation Algorithms and Measuring Ecological Statistics*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 416â€“423.

For the **VOC2012 dataset**, the citation is:
> Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C. K. I., Winn, J., & Zisserman, A. (2012). *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2012 (VOC2012) Development Kit*. 

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
