To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BEVPlace: Learning LiDAR-based Place Recognition using Bird’s Eye View Images" by Lun Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "large-scale public datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they conducted experiments on three large-scale public datasets:

1. **KITTI dataset**: This dataset is described as containing a large number of point cloud data collected by a Velodyne 64-beam LiDAR under low viewpoint variation. The authors specify that they used sequences "00", "02", "05", and "06" from the Odometry subset for evaluation.

2. **ALITA dataset**: This dataset is noted for long-term place recognition in large-scale environments, containing point cloud data of campus and city scenes under different illuminations and viewpoints. The authors mention using a subset released in the General Place Recognition Competition.

3. **Benchmark dataset**: This dataset is broadly used for place recognition methods based on unordered points. It consists of four scenarios, including an outdoor dataset (Oxford RobotCar) and three in-house datasets from different environments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **KITTI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3354–3361, 2012.

- For the **ALITA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yin Peng, Zhao Shiqi, Ge Ruohai, Cisneros Ivan, Fu Ruijie, Zhang Ji, Choset Howie, and A. Scherer Sebastian. *ALITA: A large-scale incremental dataset for long-term autonomy*. In arXiv preprint arXiv:2105.11605, 2022.

- For the **Benchmark dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mikaela Angelina Uy and Gim Hee Lee. *PointNetVLAD: Deep point cloud based retrieval for large-scale place recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 4470–4479, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and citations, ensuring that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset used in the research. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the study.
