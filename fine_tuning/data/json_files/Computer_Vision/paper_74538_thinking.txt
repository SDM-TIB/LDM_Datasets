To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Immiscible Diffusion: Accelerating Diffusion Training with Noise Assignment" by Yiheng Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on the **CIFAR dataset**, **CelebA**, and **ImageNet datasets**. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific details about each dataset in the **experiments section**. In **section 4.1 (Experiment Settings)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **CIFAR-10**: The authors mention that they used the CIFAR-10 dataset with a batch size of 512 and a resolution of 32x32 pixels. This dataset is widely known for image classification tasks.

2. **CelebA**: This dataset is used for face attribute recognition and is noted to have a batch size of 1024 and a resolution of 64x64 pixels.

3. **ImageNet**: The authors refer to using a random 10% subset of the ImageNet dataset, which is a large-scale dataset commonly used for image classification and object detection tasks. The batch size for this dataset is 2048 with a resolution of 256x256 pixels.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Toronto, ON, Canada, 2009.

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 3730–3738, 2015.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
