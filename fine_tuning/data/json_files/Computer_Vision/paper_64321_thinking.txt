To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LoGoPrompt: Synthetic Text Images Can Be Good Visual Prompts for Vision-Language Models" by Cheng Shi and Sibei Yang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on **16 datasets**, which suggests that there are multiple datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors detail their evaluation settings. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **ImageNet (Img)**: A large-scale dataset widely used for image classification tasks.
2. **Caltech101 (Cal)**: A dataset containing images of 101 object categories.
3. **OxfordPets (Pet)**: A dataset for classifying images of pets.
4. **StanfordCars (Car)**: A dataset containing images of cars from various manufacturers.
5. **Flowers102 (Flo)**: A dataset with images of flowers across 102 categories.
6. **Food101 (Foo)**: A dataset containing images of food items across 101 categories.
7. **FGVCAircraft (FGV)**: A dataset for fine-grained classification of aircraft.
8. **SUN397 (SUN)**: A dataset for scene recognition.
9. **DTD (Texture Dataset)**: A dataset for texture classification.
10. **EuroSAT (Eur)**: A dataset for land use and land cover classification.
11. **UCF101 (UCF)**: A dataset for action recognition in videos.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
