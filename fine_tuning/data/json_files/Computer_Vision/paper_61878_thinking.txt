To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SyncDiffusion: Coherent Montage via Synchronized Joint Diffusions" by Yuseung Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the capabilities of pretrained image diffusion models but does not specify any datasets. The introduction provides context about diffusion models but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention generating panorama images using the **Stable Diffusion 2.0** model, which is a pretrained model rather than a dataset. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets used for training or evaluation.

I will also check the **related work section** (Section 2) to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of previous studies. The authors discuss various diffusion models and their applications but do not provide specific dataset names.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will look at the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. The references include various papers related to diffusion models and image generation, but again, they do not specify datasets used in this particular study.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no specific datasets mentioned or utilized in the experiments of this paper. The authors focus on the methodology and results of their proposed SYNCDIFFUSION module without referencing any external datasets.

In conclusion, since no datasets are explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will not be able to provide any dataset entries or citations. If there were datasets mentioned, I would have documented them along with their full citations as per the required format. 

This process highlights the importance of carefully reading through all sections of a research paper to identify relevant datasets, even when they may not be immediately obvious.
