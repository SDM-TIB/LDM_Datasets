To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GIVT: Generative Infinite-Vocabulary Transformers" by Michael Tschannen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions of the paper, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors discuss their methodology and results, which typically includes the datasets they used for training and evaluation. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets used, as these often contain key details such as the number of samples, types of data, and any relevant splits (e.g., training, validation, test). If the paper mentions any specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **ImageNet dataset**, I would look for the citation that corresponds to it, which might be something like:
> Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, making sure to include all relevant information for each dataset extracted from the paper.
