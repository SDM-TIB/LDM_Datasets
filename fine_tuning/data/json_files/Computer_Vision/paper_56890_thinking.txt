To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Novel Sampling Scheme for Text- and Image-Conditional Image Synthesis in Quantized Latent Spaces" by Dominic Rampas et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors trained a model called "Paella" on a large dataset, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss advancements in text-to-image synthesis and reference various models and datasets. However, I need to look for specific dataset names and details.

In the **experiments section (Section 4)**, the authors provide information about the training process. They mention that the model was trained on **900 million images from the improved LAION-5B aesthetic dataset**. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the LAION-5B dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Schuhmann, C., Beaumont, R., Vencu, R., Gordon, C., Wightman, R., Cherti, M., Coombes, T., Katta, A., Mullis, C., Wortsman, M., et al. (2022). *Laion-5b: An open large-scale dataset for training next generation image-text models*. arXiv:2210.08402.

Since the paper primarily discusses the training of the model on this dataset, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the LAION-5B dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will be the only dataset extracted from this paper, as it is the primary focus of the experiments.

After completing this process, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
