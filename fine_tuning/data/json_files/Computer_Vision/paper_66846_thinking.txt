To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DifFlow3D: Toward Robust Uncertainty-Aware Scene Flow Estimation with Diffusion Model" by Jiuming Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on the **FlyingThings3D** and **KITTI 2015** datasets, indicating that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **Experiments section**. In the **Experiments section (4.1)**, the authors explicitly mention that they trained their model on the **FlyingThings3D dataset** and evaluated it on both **FlyingThings3D** and **KITTI** datasets. This confirms the datasets used for their research.

Now, I will gather the necessary details about each dataset. The paper mentions:

1. **FlyingThings3D Dataset**: This dataset is used for training the model. It is a synthetic dataset designed for scene flow estimation.

2. **KITTI Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluation. It is a well-known benchmark in the field of computer vision, particularly for autonomous driving tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **FlyingThings3D**, the citation is:
  > Nikolaus Mayer, Eddy Ilg, Philip Hausser, Philipp Fischer, Daniel Cremers, Alexey Dosovitskiy, and Thomas Brox. *A large dataset to train convolutional networks for disparity, optical flow, and scene flow estimation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 4040–4048, 2016.

- For **KITTI**, the citation is:
  > Moritz Menze and Andreas Geiger. *Object scene flow for autonomous vehicles*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 3061–3070, 2015.

With this information, I will now prepare the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
