To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Intriguing Properties of Diffusion Models: An Empirical Study of the Natural Attack Capability in Text-to-Image Generative Models" by Takami Sato et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a dataset called the **Natural Denoising Diffusion Attack (NDDA) dataset** to evaluate the natural attack capability of diffusion models. This is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Attack Capability Analysis)**, where the authors describe the NDDA dataset in detail. They mention that the dataset was constructed to systematically collect images with and without robust features essential for human visual perception. The NDDA dataset includes images generated by three state-of-the-art diffusion models and covers various object classes, specifically mentioning **stop signs, fire hydrants, and horses**.

In the **Appendix**, the authors provide additional details about the NDDA dataset, including the number of images and the classes involved. They state that the dataset consists of 15 classes, including stop signs, cars, dogs, hot dogs, traffic lights, zebras, fire hydrants, frogs, horses, birds, boats, airplanes, bicycles, cats, and carrots, generated by six different diffusion models.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the NDDA dataset and any other datasets mentioned. The NDDA dataset is primarily referenced in the context of the paper itself, and the authors do not provide a separate citation for it, as it is their own creation.

The citation for the NDDA dataset can be formatted as follows:
> Takami Sato, Justin Yue, Nanze Chen, Ningfei Wang, Qi Alfred Chen. *Intriguing Properties of Diffusion Models: An Empirical Study of the Natural Attack Capability in Text-to-Image Generative Models*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2023.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the NDDA dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution. This will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
