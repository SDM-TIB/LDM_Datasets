To extract datasets from the research paper titled "YOGA: Deep Object Detection in the Wild with Lightweight Feature Learning and Multiscale Attention" by Raja Sunkara and Tie Luo, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the YOGA model is evaluated on the **COCO-val** and **COCO-testdev** datasets, indicating that these are the datasets used for performance evaluation.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors mention that they used the **COCO-2017 dataset**, which is divided into three parts: **train2017** (118,287 images), **val2017** (5,000 images), and **test2017** (40,670 images). This confirms that the COCO dataset is indeed the primary dataset used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The COCO dataset is widely recognized, and its citation is as follows:

- For the **COCO dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., Zitnick, C.L. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, Springer, pp. 740–755.

With this information, I can summarize the datasets used in the paper:

1. **COCO-2017 Dataset**: This dataset is used for training, validation, and testing of the YOGA model. It consists of 118,287 images for training, 5,000 images for validation, and 40,670 images for testing.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that the full citations are correctly formatted and included for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
