To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Flow Priors for Linear Inverse Problems via Iterative Corrupted Trajectory Matching" by Yasi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for validation or experimentation. In this case, the authors discuss validating their approach on various linear inverse problems, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and characteristics. 

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using the **CelebA-HQ dataset** for natural images and the **Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset** for medical imaging. I will note down the details provided about these datasets:

1. **CelebA-HQ Dataset**: The authors state that they evaluate their algorithm using 100 images from the CelebA-HQ validation set, which contains high-resolution images of celebrity faces.

2. **Human Connectome Project (HCP) Dataset**: The authors mention using T2-weighted images from the HCP dataset, which includes brain images from 47 patients.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For the **CelebA-HQ dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 3730–3738, 2015.

- For the **Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset**, the citation is:
  > David C. Van Essen, Stephen M. Smith, Deanna M. Barch, Timothy E.J. Behrens, Essa Yacoub, Kamil Ugurbil, and the Wu-Minn HCP Consortium. *The Wu-Minn Human Connectome Project: An Overview*. NeuroImage, 80:62–79, 2013.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
