To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Refining Skewed Perceptions in Vision-Language Models through Visual Representations" by Haocheng Dai and Sarang Joshi, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors discuss the evaluation of their methods on datasets like **Waterbirds** and **CelebA**, which indicates that these datasets are relevant to their research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention the **Waterbirds dataset** and the **CelebA dataset** as benchmarks for their experiments. This confirms that these datasets are central to their research.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the paper, the authors describe the **Waterbirds dataset** as a benchmark for binary classification tasks that examines spurious correlations, and the **CelebA dataset** is noted for its use in classifying celebrity attributes, particularly hair color.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **Waterbirds Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Sagawa, S., Koh, P. W., Hashimoto, T. B., & Liang, P. (2019). Distributionally robust neural networks for group shifts: On the importance of regularization for worst-case generalization. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.08731*.

2. **CelebA Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2018). Large-scale celebfaces attributes (CelebA) dataset. *Retrieved August, 15(2018):11*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
