To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Topology-Aware Latent Diffusion for 3D Shape Generation" by Jiangbei Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that their framework demonstrates effectiveness using various datasets, specifically referencing the **ShapeNet dataset** and the **ABC dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experimental setup** section. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup in detail, stating that they selected 6778 meshes of the chair category and 8436 meshes of the table category from the **ShapeNet dataset**. They also mention using 7731 CAD meshes from the **ABC dataset**. This confirms the datasets used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. For the **ShapeNet dataset**, the citation is:
   > Chang, A. X., Funkhouser, T., Guibas, L., Hanrahan, P., Huang, Q., Li, Z., Savarese, S., Savva, M., Song, S., Su, H., Xiao, J., Yi, L., & Yu, F. (2015). *ShapeNet: An Information-Rich 3D Model Repository*. Technical Report arXiv:1512.03012 [cs.GR], Stanford University — Princeton University — Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago.

2. For the **ABC dataset**, the citation is:
   > Koch, S., Matveev, A., Jiang, Z., Williams, F., Artemov, A., Burnaev, E., Alexa, M., Zorin, D., & Panozzo, D. (2019). *ABC: A Big CAD Model Dataset for Geometric Deep Learning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), June 2019.

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

- **ShapeNet dataset**: Contains 6778 meshes of the chair category and 8436 meshes of the table category.
- **ABC dataset**: Comprises 7731 CAD meshes.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation.
