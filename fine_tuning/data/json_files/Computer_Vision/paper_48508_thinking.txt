To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparison of Random Sampling and Heuristic Optimization-Based Methods for Determining the Flexibility Potential at Vertical System Interconnections" by Johannes Gerster et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors discuss the construction of synthetic feeders. In this section, they mention that they constructed **four synthetic 0.4 kV feeders** with varying numbers of nodes (1, 3, 9, and 27). This indicates that the synthetic feeders serve as a dataset for their experiments.

I will also look for any specific references to datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. The authors describe how they generated samples for each feeder and the parameters used, which may provide additional context for the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or methodologies that are referenced. In this case, the authors refer to previous works that may have established the methodologies or datasets they are using.

The relevant datasets identified from the paper are:

1. **Synthetic 0.4 kV Feeders**: The authors constructed four synthetic feeders characterized by different numbers of nodes (1, 3, 9, and 27). The feeders are used to evaluate the proposed methods for determining the flexibility potential.

2. **Dirichlet Distribution Samples**: The authors mention using a two-stage random sampling approach based on the Dirichlet distribution to generate benchmark datasets for their experiments.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **synthetic feeders**, since they are constructed by the authors, I will note that they are original datasets created for this study, and thus do not have a separate citation.

- For the **Dirichlet distribution**, I will reference the foundational work on the Dirichlet distribution, which is commonly cited in statistical literature. A suitable citation could be:
  > Ng, K. W., Tian, G.-L., & Tang, M.-L. (2011). *Dirichlet and related distributions: Theory, methods and applications*.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to format the dataset information according to the required structure, ensuring that I include the full citations for any referenced methodologies or datasets.
