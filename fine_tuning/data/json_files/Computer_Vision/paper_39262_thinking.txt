To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fully Learnable Group Convolution for Acceleration of Deep Neural Networks" by Xijun Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it often hints at the datasets used for evaluation. The introduction typically outlines the context and may reference specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors usually detail the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their method on several datasets, which is a strong indication that I need to identify them.

I will also check the **methodology section** if available, as it may provide additional context about how the datasets were used or any preprocessing steps taken. 

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for readers to locate the original sources.

For example, if the authors mention using the **CASIA-WebFace dataset**, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Yi, D., Lei, Z., Liao, S., & Li, S. Z. (2014). Learning face representation from scratch. arXiv preprint arXiv:1411.7923.

Similarly, if they mention the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, I will find its citation, which could be:
> Krizhevsky, A. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset names, descriptions, and their full citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

In summary, my step-by-step approach will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and experiments sections for dataset mentions.
2. Identify specific datasets and their descriptions in the experiments section.
3. Check the methodology section for additional context on dataset usage.
4. Retrieve full citations for each dataset from the references section.
5. Compile the information into a clear and structured format for further use.
