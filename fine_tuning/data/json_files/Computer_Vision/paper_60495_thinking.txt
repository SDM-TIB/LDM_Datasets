To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Input Augmentation with SAM: Boosting Medical Image Segmentation with Segmentation Foundation Model" by Yizhe Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three segmentation tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Setups)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they list three datasets:

1. **Polyp Dataset**: This dataset is used for polyp segmentation experiments. The authors reference the CVC-300 dataset, which is commonly used for this purpose.

2. **MoNuSeg Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as consisting of H&E stained tissue images from the TCGA archive, with specific details about the number of images and annotations.

3. **GlaS Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of gland segmentation, and the authors provide details about the number of training and test images.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for each of these datasets to ensure I have the correct and complete information. The citations I find are:

- For the **CVC-300 Dataset**:
  > David Vázquez, Jorge Bernal, F Javier Sánchez, Gloria Fernández-Esparrach, Antonio M López, Adriana Romero, Michal Drozdzal, and Aaron Courville. *A benchmark for endoluminal scene segmentation of colonoscopy images*. Journal of Healthcare Engineering, 2017.

- For the **MoNuSeg Dataset**:
  > Neeraj Kumar, Ruchika Verma, Sanuj Sharma, Surabhi Bhargava, Abhishek Vahadane, and Amit Sethi. *A dataset and a technique for generalized nuclear segmentation for computational pathology*. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 36(7):1550–1560, 2017.

- For the **GlaS Dataset**:
  > Korsuk Sirinukunwattana, Josien PW Pluim, Hao Chen, Xiaojuan Qi, Pheng-Ann Heng, Yun Bo Guo, Li Yang Wang, Bogdan J Matuszewski, Elia Bruni, Urko Sanchez, et al. *Gland segmentation in colon histology images: The GlaS challenge contest*. Medical Image Analysis, 35:489–502, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will summarize this information clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
