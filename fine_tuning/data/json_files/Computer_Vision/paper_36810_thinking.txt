To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Networks based EEG-Speech Models" by Pengfei Sun and Jun Qin, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a neural network-based EEG-speech modeling framework, which suggests that there may be datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using the **KARA ONE dataset** for their experimental evaluations. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its characteristics and the context in which it was used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the KARA ONE dataset as combining EEG, face tracking, and audio data during imagined and vocalized phonemic and single-word prompts. They provide details about the number of participants and trials, as well as the EEG recording setup. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and application.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the KARA ONE dataset. The authors reference a previous work that describes this dataset. I will ensure to extract the complete citation from that reference.

The citation for the KARA ONE dataset is:
> Zhao, S., & Rudzicz, F. (2015). Classifying phonological categories in imagined and articulated speech. In *2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)* (pp. 992â€“996). IEEE.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the dataset details, including its name, description, and citation, ensuring that the citation is complete and formatted correctly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified and properly cited.
