To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-isomorphic Inter-modality Graph Alignment and Synthesis for Holistic Brain Mapping" by Islem Mhiri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of a framework for predicting brain graphs, which suggests that datasets related to brain imaging may be involved.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly the part where the authors describe their experimental setup. In this section, they mention using the **Southwest University Longitudinal Imaging Multimodal (SLIM) public dataset** for their experiments. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

I will then look for specific details about the datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors describe how they used T1-weighted and T2-weighted MRI scans, as well as resting-state fMRI scans, to create morphological and functional brain networks. This indicates that the datasets are derived from neuroimaging modalities.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the **SLIM dataset** from the references section. The citation is as follows:
> Dosenbach, N.U., Nardos, B., Cohen, A.L., Fair, D.A., Power, J.D., Church, J.A., Nelson, S.M., Wig, G.S., Vogel, A.C., Lessov-Schlaggar, C.N., et al. *Prediction of individual brain maturity using fMRI*. Science 329 (2010) 1358â€“1361.

Additionally, I will note that the authors mention using **FreeSurfer** for reconstructing the cortical morphological network, which is a software tool rather than a dataset. However, it is important to acknowledge its role in processing the neuroimaging data.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that I have clearly documented the datasets and their citations. The key dataset extracted from this paper is the SLIM dataset, which is crucial for the experiments conducted by the authors.

Finally, I will prepare to format this information into the required output structure, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
