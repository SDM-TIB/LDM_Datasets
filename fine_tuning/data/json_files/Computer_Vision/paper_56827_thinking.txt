To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-view Graph Contrastive Representation Learning on Partially Aligned Multi-view Data" by Yiming Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on several real datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper. The introduction may provide context or specific mentions of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, it appears that the datasets are summarized in **Section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**. Here, the authors explicitly list five datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Scene-15**: Contains 4485 images of 15 categories with two image features as views.
2. **Caltech-101**: A widely-used image dataset containing 9144 instances from 101 categories, using HOG and GIST features.
3. **Reuters**: Comprises 18758 instances of six subjects, with English and French as two views.
4. **BBCSport**: A synthetic multi-view text dataset from BBC Sport corpora, using 282 samples from 5 classes.
5. **100Leaves**: Contains 1600 instances from 100 categories, utilizing shape descriptor, fine scale margin, and texture histogram features as three views.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
