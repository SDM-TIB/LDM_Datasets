To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-scale Spatial-Temporal Interaction Network for Video Anomaly Detection" by Zhiyuan Ning et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validated their approach on three benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this case, they state that their method was tested on the **UCSD Ped2**, **CUHK Avenue**, and **ShanghaiTech datasets**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed method.

I will then look for any additional details about these datasets in the paper. The authors provide performance metrics (AUC scores) for each dataset, which confirms their relevance and importance in the context of the experiments conducted.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is critical for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **UCSD Ped2 Dataset**: 
  > Weixin Li, Vijay Mahadevan, and Nuno Vasconcelos. "Anomaly detection and localization in crowded scenes." *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*, vol. 36, no. 1, pp. 18–32, 2013.

- **CUHK Avenue Dataset**: 
  > Cewu Lu, Jianping Shi, and Jiaya Jia. "Abnormal event detection at 150 fps in matlab." In *Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision*, 2013, pp. 2720–2727.

  > Weixin Luo, Wen Liu, and Shenghua Gao. "A revisit of sparse coding based anomaly detection in stacked RNN framework." In *Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision*, 2017, pp. 341–349.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further analysis and understanding of the research findings presented in the paper.
