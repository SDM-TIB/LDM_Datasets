To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Image Quality Evaluation and Masking Algorithm Based On Pre-trained Deep Neural Networks" by Peng Jia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and performance evaluation sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the algorithm using "two test cases," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors provide any specific names or descriptions of datasets. The introduction discusses the need for automated data processing in astronomy but does not explicitly mention datasets.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any details about the datasets used for training and testing the proposed algorithm. The authors mention using "simulated images" generated by the SkyMaker and Stuff software, which indicates that these tools are used to create datasets for evaluation.

Moving to the **performance evaluation section**, I will find specific mentions of datasets. The authors describe using "simulated images with varying levels of complex background noise" and "real observational images obtained by the Ground Wide Angle Camera Array (GWAC)." This gives me two distinct datasets to document:

1. **Simulated Images**: Generated using the SkyMaker and Stuff software, which simulates the impact of various factors on astronomical images. The authors do not provide a specific citation for these tools, but they are essential for creating the dataset.

2. **GWAC Dataset**: This dataset consists of real observational images collected by the Ground Wide Angle Camera Array, which is designed for monitoring time-domain astronomical events. The authors reference the GWAC in the context of their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the SkyMaker and Stuff software are tools rather than datasets, I will not find a citation for them. For the GWAC, I will look for any papers that describe the GWAC system or its data collection methods.

After reviewing the references, I find the following citation for the GWAC:

- For the GWAC dataset, the citation is:
  > Wei, J., Cordier, B., Antier, S., et al. 2016, "The Deep and Transient Universe in the SVOM Era: New Challenges and Opportunities - Scientific prospects of the SVOM mission." arXiv:1610.06892.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes noting the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and the full citations as required.
