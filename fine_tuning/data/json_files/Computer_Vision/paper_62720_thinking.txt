To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Graph Convolution Networks for Traffic Flow Forecasting" by Zhengdao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on "two public traffic datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they describe:

1. **METR-LA**: This dataset is collected from observation sensors in the highway of Los Angeles County, using 207 sensors and covering data from March 1, 2012, to June 30, 2012.

2. **PeMS-BAY**: This dataset is collected from Caltrans PeMS in the Bay Area of California, consisting of data from 325 sensors over a period of six months, from January 2017 to May 2017.

Both datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper, and the authors provide sufficient detail about their origins and characteristics.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are publicly available and not necessarily tied to a specific publication, I will note them as they are described in the paper without additional citations.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **METR-LA**:
  > METR-LA dataset: Collected from observation sensors in the highway of Los Angeles County, using 207 sensors, covering data from March 1, 2012, to June 30, 2012.

- For **PeMS-BAY**:
  > PeMS-BAY dataset: Collected from Caltrans PeMS in the Bay Area of California, consisting of data from 325 sensors over a period from January 2017 to May 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
