To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DialogGen: Multi-modal Interactive Dialogue System for Multi-turn Text-to-Image Generation" by Minbin Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. In the abstract, the authors introduce the **Multi-modal Dialogue Benchmark (DialogBen)**, which is a key dataset for evaluating their proposed system. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the need for comprehensive benchmarks in the field of multi-modal interactive dialogue systems. They mention DialogBen again, emphasizing its importance for evaluating the capabilities of their system.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in **section 3 (DialogBen)**, the authors provide detailed information about the DialogBen dataset. They describe it as containing **9957 three-turn conversations** that cover various image editing types and topic types. This section will be crucial for gathering specific details about the dataset.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or used in their experiments. However, the primary focus seems to be on DialogBen.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the DialogBen dataset. Since it is a benchmark introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:

- **DialogBen Dataset**:
  > Minbin Huang, Yanxin Long, Xinchi Deng, Ruihang Chu, Jiangfeng Xiong, Xiaodan Liang, Hong Cheng, Qinglin Lu, Wei Liu. *DialogGen: Multi-modal Interactive Dialogue System for Multi-turn Text-to-Image Generation*. Preprint. Under review.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for DialogBen, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format for further processing or review.
