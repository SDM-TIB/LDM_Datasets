To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards better traffic volume estimation: Jointly addressing the underdetermination and nonequilibrium problems with correlation-adaptive GNNs" by Tong Nie et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on a **real-world highway traffic volume dataset**, which suggests that a specific dataset is used.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges of traffic volume estimation and mention the use of **PeMS-Bay traffic volume data** collected from loop sensors in the San Francisco Bay area. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide more details about the dataset, specifying that it includes data collected from **325 loop sensors** over a period from January to March 2018, with a 5-minute time interval. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and characteristics.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the PeMS-Bay dataset. The paper does not provide a specific reference for the dataset itself, but it mentions that the data is collected from the Performance Measurement System of California. Therefore, I will cite it as follows:

- **PeMS-Bay Traffic Volume Dataset**: 
  > Performance Measurement System (PeMS). *California Department of Transportation*. Available at: https://pems.dot.ca.gov/

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the dataset details, including its name, description, and citation, ensuring that the citation is complete and accurate.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
