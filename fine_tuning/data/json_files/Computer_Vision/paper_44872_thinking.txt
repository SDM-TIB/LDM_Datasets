To extract datasets from the research paper titled "COVID CT-Net: Predicting Covid-19 From Chest CT Images Using Attentional Convolutional Network" by Shakib Yazdani et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their model on a dataset of more than 2000 CT images, which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section III (COVID-19 CT Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed overview of the dataset used. They mention that the dataset is publicly available and consists of 2482 CT scan images, with 1252 labeled as COVID-19 and 1230 as non-COVID-19. This section is crucial as it provides specific details about the dataset's composition.

I will also look for any additional information regarding the dataset's source or characteristics, which is mentioned in the same section. The authors state that the dataset was collected from real patients in hospitals in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and that they used data augmentation techniques to increase the number of training samples.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- For the SARS-CoV-2 CT scan dataset, the citation is:
  > "SARS-CoV-2 CT scan dataset." Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/plameneduardo/sarscov2-ctscan-dataset.

This citation indicates that the dataset is hosted on Kaggle, which is a well-known platform for sharing datasets.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurate.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for further processing or review.
