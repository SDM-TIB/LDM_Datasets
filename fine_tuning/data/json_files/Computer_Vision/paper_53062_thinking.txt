To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CoupleFace: Relation Matters for Face Recognition Distillation" by Jiaheng Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experimental results were conducted on multiple benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and testing their models. In this section, they mention using the **Glint-Mini dataset** for training and three datasets for testing: **IJB-B**, **IJB-C**, and **MegaFace**.

1. **Glint-Mini Dataset**: The authors state that Glint-Mini contains 5.2 million images of 91,000 identities. This dataset is crucial for training their models.

2. **IJB-B Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as one of the testing benchmarks. It is important to note its significance in evaluating the performance of face recognition systems.

3. **IJB-C Dataset**: Similar to IJB-B, this dataset is also used for testing and is mentioned alongside IJB-B.

4. **MegaFace Dataset**: This dataset is used for testing as well, and it is known for its large scale, which is essential for evaluating face recognition systems under various conditions.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For **Glint-Mini**, the citation is:
  > InsightFace: Glint-mini face recognition dataset. [online]. https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/tree/master/recognition/_datasets_ (2021).

- For **IJB-B**, the citation is:
  > Whitelam, C., Taborsky, E., Blanton, A., Maze, B., Adams, J., Miller, T., Kalka, N., Jain, A.K., Duncan, J.A., Allen, K., et al. *Iarpa janus benchmark-b face dataset*. In: Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops. pp. 90–98 (2017).

- For **IJB-C**, the citation is:
  > Maze, B., Adams, J., Duncan, J.A., Kalka, N., Miller, T., Otto, C., Jain, A.K., Niggel, W.T., Anderson, J., Cheney, J., et al. *Iarpa janus benchmark-c: Face dataset and protocol*. In: 2018 International Conference on Biometrics (ICB). pp. 158–165. IEEE (2018).

- For **MegaFace**, the citation is:
  > Kemelmacher-Shlizerman, I., Seitz, S.M., Miller, D., Brossard, E. *The megaface benchmark: 1 million faces for recognition at scale*. In: Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. pp. 4873–4882 (2016).

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its full citation. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
