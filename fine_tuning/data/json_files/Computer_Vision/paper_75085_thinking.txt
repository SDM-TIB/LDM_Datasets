To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SFC: Achieve Accurate Fast Convolution under Low-precision Arithmetic" by Liulu He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for validation or testing. The introduction often elaborates on the context of the research and may specify datasets that are relevant to the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on the **ImageNet dataset**. This is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning, particularly for image classification tasks.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The citation for the ImageNet dataset is as follows:
> Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

Since the paper primarily discusses the ImageNet dataset, I will document this dataset in detail.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as required. The dataset entry will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the citation.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output that clearly presents the dataset information extracted from the paper, ready for further use or analysis.
