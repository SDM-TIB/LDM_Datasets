To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Public policy for management of forest pests within an ownership mosaic" by Andrew R. Tilman and Robert G. Haight, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, which may include mentions of datasets related to urban forests and pest management.

Next, I will pay close attention to the **methodology section**, as it often contains details about the datasets used for analysis, including their sources, characteristics, and any relevant statistics. If the authors mention specific datasets or studies that provide data, I will note these down.

In the **results section**, I will look for any figures, tables, or descriptions that reference datasets. This section may provide insights into how the datasets were analyzed and the outcomes derived from them.

I will also check the **discussion section** for any references to datasets that support the authors' conclusions or provide context for their findings. This section may include comparisons to other studies or datasets that are relevant to the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper references a dataset like the "Emerald Ash Borer Information Network," I would look for the full citation, which might include the authors, title, publication year, and any relevant URLs or DOI links.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that the extracted information is organized clearly and accurately, ready for any further processing or review.
