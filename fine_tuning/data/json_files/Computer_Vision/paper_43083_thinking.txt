To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-resolution Convolutional Autoencoders" by Yuying Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics.

In **subsection 4.1 (Individual experiments)**, the authors describe several experiments, and I will carefully note any datasets mentioned:

1. **Channel Flow Dataset**: This dataset is acquired from the Johns Hopkins Turbulence Database. It is generated by solving the Navier-Stokes equations in a specific domain and includes 500 snapshots collected at a defined time interval.

2. **Forced Isotropic Turbulence Dataset**: Also from the Johns Hopkins Turbulence Database, this dataset is generated from a direct numerical simulation of forced isotropic turbulence on a periodic grid, with specific dimensions and snapshot collection details.

3. **Sea Surface Temperature Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from the NOAA OI SST V2 data, which spans a 20-year period and is collected monthly.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For the **Channel Flow Dataset**:
  > Kanov, K., Burns, R., Lalescu, C., & Eyink, G. (2015). A web services accessible database of turbulent channel flow and its use for testing a new integral wall model for LES. *Journal of Turbulence*, 17, 181-215.

- For the **Forced Isotropic Turbulence Dataset**:
  > Li, Y., Perlman, E., Wan, M., Yang, Y., Meneveau, C., Burns, R., Chen, S., Szalay, A., & Eyink, G. (2008). A public turbulence database cluster and applications to study Lagrangian evolution of velocity increments in turbulence. *Journal of Turbulence*, N31.

- For the **Sea Surface Temperature Dataset**:
  > NOAA. (2010). NOAA OI SST V2 data set. Retrieved from http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
