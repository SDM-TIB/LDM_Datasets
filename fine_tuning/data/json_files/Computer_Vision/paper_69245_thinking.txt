To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion Models as Prompt Generators for Single Image Reflection Removal" by Tao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on "commonly used benchmarks," which suggests that specific datasets are utilized. I will look for any explicit mentions of dataset names or references.

Next, I will carefully read through the **experiments section** (section 4) to identify any datasets that are explicitly named or described. In this section, the authors mention that they conduct experiments on popular benchmarks and provide details about the datasets used for training and testing.

From the text, I note the following datasets mentioned:

1. **PASCAL VOC Dataset**: This dataset is used to synthesize training images. The authors state they synthesized 7,643 images using a specific data-generation method.
   
2. **Nature Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as one of the real-world datasets used for testing, and it is cited as coming from Li et al. (2020).

3. **SIR2 Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as comprising three subsets: PostCard, SolidObject, and WildScene. It is also cited from Wan et al. (2017).

4. **Real Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as coming from Zhang et al. (2018) and is used for testing.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to gather the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For the **PASCAL VOC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C. K. I., Winn, J., & Zisserman, A. (2010). The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge. *International Journal of Computer Vision*, 88(2), 303-338.

- For the **Nature Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li, C., Yang, Y., He, K., Lin, S., & Hopcroft, J. E. (2020). Single image reflection removal through cascaded refinement. In *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*, pp. 3565-3574.

- For the **SIR2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wan, R., Shi, B., Duan, L.-Y., Tan, A.-H., & Kot, A. C. (2017). Benchmarking single-image reflection removal algorithms. In *Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)*, pp. 3942-3950.

- For the **Real Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, X., Ng, R., & Chen, Q. (2018). Single image reflection separation with perceptual losses. In *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*, pp. 4786-4794.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
