To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ImplicitDeepfake: Plausible Face-Swapping through Implicit Deepfake Generation using NeRF and Gaussian Splatting" by Georgii Stanishevskii et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a general overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction might mention datasets used for training or evaluation, so I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is often where authors detail the datasets they used for their experiments. If the paper includes a section specifically discussing datasets, I will extract the names, descriptions, and any relevant details about how they were used in the research.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets related to the training of the ImplicitDeepfake model, particularly those used for the 2D deepfake generation and the subsequent training of NeRF and Gaussian Splatting models.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions using a dataset like GHOST for deepfake generation, I will ensure to find the full citation for the GHOST paper, which is referenced in the text.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation formatted correctly.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate.
