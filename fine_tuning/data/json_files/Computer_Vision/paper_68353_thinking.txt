To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BA-SAM: Scalable Bias-Mode Attention Mask for Segment Anything Model" by Yiran Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive evaluations on diverse datasets, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly list the datasets they evaluated their method on. They mention four datasets: **DUTS**, **DIS-TE4**, **ISIC**, and **COD10K**. I will note down the context in which these datasets are used, including any specific characteristics or details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The citations I will look for are:

1. **DUTS Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Lijun Wang, Huchuan Lu, Yifan Wang, Mengyang Feng, Dong Wang, Baocai Yin, and Xiang Ruan. *Learning to detect salient objects with image-level supervision*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

2. **DIS-TE4 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Deng-Ping Fan, Ming-Ming Cheng, Jiang-Jiang Liu, Shang-Hua Gao, Qibin Hou, and Ali Borji. *Salient objects in clutter: Bringing salient object detection to the foreground*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2018.

3. **ISIC Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Noel CF Codella, David Gutman, M Emre Celebi, Brian Helba, Michael A Marchetti, Stephen W Dusza, Aadi Kalloo, Konstantinos Liopyris, Nabin Mishra, Harald Kittler, et al. *Skin lesion analysis toward melanoma detection: A challenge at the 2017 international symposium on biomedical imaging (ISBI), hosted by the international skin imaging collaboration (ISIC)*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI), 2018.

4. **COD10K Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Deng-Ping Fan, Ge-Peng Ji, Ming-Ming Cheng, and Ling Shao. *Camouflaged object detection*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
