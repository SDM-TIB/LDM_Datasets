To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing the Whole-life Cost in End-to-end CNN Acceleration" by Jiaqi Zhang, Xiangru Chen, and Sandip Ray, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I need to look for specific dataset names or descriptions in the introduction and methodology.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed. I will look for any tables, figures, or text that explicitly mention datasets used for evaluation or training. If the authors refer to specific datasets, I will note their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, I will pay special attention to any **tables or figures** that summarize the datasets used in their experiments. If the authors provide a table listing the datasets, I will extract the relevant information from there.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like "ImageNet," I will look for the original citation for ImageNet in the references. If they refer to a specific benchmark dataset, I will do the same.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I accurately represent the information as presented in the paper.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for any further processing or presentation.
