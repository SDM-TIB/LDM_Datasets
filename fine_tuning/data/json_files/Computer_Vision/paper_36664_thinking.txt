To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeLiGAN: Generative Adversarial Networks for Diverse and Limited Data" by Swaminathan Gurumurthy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights that the authors demonstrate the capabilities of DeLiGAN on various modalities, which suggests that multiple datasets may be involved.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three specific datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of 60,000 images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The authors specify that they conduct experiments on a reduced training set of 500 images to simulate a low-data scenario.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 object classes. The authors mention using a reduced dataset of 2,000 images for their experiments.

3. **TU-Berlin Dataset**: This dataset includes 20,000 hand-drawn sketches evenly distributed among 250 object categories, with 80 images per category. The authors use this dataset to demonstrate the capabilities of their model in a scenario with limited training data.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. 

- For the **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For the **TU-Berlin Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Matthias Eitz, James Hays, and Marc Alexa. *How do humans sketch objects?* ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 31(4):44, 2012.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, maintaining the importance of full citations for each dataset.
