To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Benchmarking structure-based three-dimensional molecular generative models using GenBench3D: ligand conformation quality matters" by Benoit Baillif et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the development of **GenBench3D**, which is a benchmark for evaluating molecular generative models. This indicates that there may be datasets associated with this benchmark.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods** section, particularly where the authors describe the benchmarking process and the models evaluated. I will pay close attention to any references to datasets used for training or testing the generative models.

In the **results** and **discussion** sections, I will look for any references to datasets that were used to validate the findings or to compare the performance of the generative models. The authors may also discuss datasets in the context of their results, which can provide insights into the datasets' characteristics.

I will also check the **references** section for any citations related to datasets. This is crucial as it will provide the full citations needed for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

From my reading, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **Cambridge Structural Database (CSD)**: This database is referenced multiple times as a source for evaluating molecular geometries. The authors mention using the CSD Drug subset, which contains curated crystal structures of organic and metal-organic molecules.

   Citation:
   > Groom CR, Bruno IJ, Lightfoot MP, Ward SC. The Cambridge Structural Database. *Acta Crystallogr Sect B Struct Sci Cryst Eng Mater*. 2016;72:171–9. https://doi.org/10.1107/S2052520616003954.

2. **CrossDocked Dataset**: This dataset is used for training the generative models and is mentioned in the context of the models' performance evaluation.

   Citation:
   > Francoeur PG, Masuda T, Sunseri J, Jia A, Iovanisci RB, Snyder I, et al. Three-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks and a Cross-Docked Data Set for Structure-Based Drug Design. *J Chem Inf Model*. 2020;60:4200–15. https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00411.

3. **CSD Drug Subset**: This subset is specifically mentioned as containing 8632 crystal structures from 785 unique drug molecules, which were used for evaluating the validity of generated molecular geometries.

   Citation:
   > Bryant MJ, Black SN, Blade H, Docherty R, Maloney AGP, Taylor SC. The CSD Drug Subset: The Changing Chemistry and Crystallography of Small Molecule Pharmaceuticals. *J Pharm Sci*. 2019;108:1655–62. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xphs.2018.12.011.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for each and compile them into a structured format for further use. This systematic approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
