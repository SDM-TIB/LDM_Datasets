To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Spatiotemporal Traffic Prediction through Urban Human Activity Analysis" by Sumin Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setting sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions leveraging human activity frequency data from the **National Household Travel Survey**, which indicates that this dataset is important for the study.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly **section 5 (Experimental Setting)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention three traffic datasets:

1. **METR-LA**: This dataset contains traffic speed data recorded by 325 sensors, with a mean speed of 62 mph. The data spans from March 1, 2012, to January 1, 2017.

2. **PEMS-BAY**: This dataset includes traffic speed data from 207 sensors, with a mean speed of 54 mph, covering the period from June 30, 2012, to May 31, 2017.

3. **PEMSD7**: This dataset consists of traffic data from 62 sensors, with a mean speed of 52 mph, specifically for weekdays, from May 1, 2012, to June 30, 2012.

Additionally, the authors mention using the **National Household Travel Survey** for urban human activity data, which is crucial for their analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **METR-LA**, the citation is:
  > Li, Y., Yu, R., Shahabi, C., & Liu, Y. (2018). Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network: Data-Driven Traffic Forecasting. In 6th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2018).

- For **PEMS-BAY**, the citation is:

- For **PEMSD7**, the citation is:
  > Yu, B., Yin, H., & Zhu, Z. (2018). Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks: A Deep Learning Framework for Traffic Forecasting. In Proceedings of the Twenty-Seventh International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2018).

- For the **National Household Travel Survey**, the citation is:
  > Federal Highway Administration U.S. Department of Transportation. (2017). 2017 National Household Travel Survey. Retrieved from http://nhts.ornl.gov.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the requirements.
