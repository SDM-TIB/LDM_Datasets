To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Generation of Realistic Fully-Annotated Microscopy Image Data Sets" by Dennis Eschweiler and Johannes Stegmaier, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that multiple datasets are used as inspiration for simulating sketches of cellular structures, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Simulation of Cellular Structures)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for simulating cellular structures. They mention five different fluorescence microscopy image datasets as guidelines for their simulation experiments. I will extract the names of these datasets and any relevant details provided.

The datasets mentioned in this section are:

1. **Arabidopsis thaliana (3D)**: This dataset includes 3D fluorescence microscopy images of the meristem of A. thaliana, along with manually corrected annotation masks for each of the 125 image stacks.

2. **Caenorhabditis elegans (3D)**: This dataset contains 3D image stacks of developing C. elegans, which are used to simulate nuclei.

3. **Tribolium castaneum (3D)**: This dataset shows nuclei in developing T. castaneum embryos and is used for simulating nuclei in the authors' experiments.

4. **Mouse Stem Cells (2D)**: This dataset is used to simulate a 2D data set of mouse stem cells, with specific parameters for nuclei shapes and placements.

5. **HeLa Cells (2D)**: This dataset serves as inspiration for simulating nuclei in HeLa cells, with details on how the regions of interest are constructed.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
