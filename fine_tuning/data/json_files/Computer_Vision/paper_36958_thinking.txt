To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Regressing Robust and Discriminative 3D Morphable Models with a very Deep Neural Network" by Anh Tuan Tran et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on several benchmarks, which suggests the presence of datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of using 3D shapes for face recognition and mention the need for robust datasets. They highlight that their method surpasses state-of-the-art accuracy on the **MICC dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors provide detailed evaluations of their method. They mention using the following datasets:

1. **MICC Dataset**: This dataset contains challenging face videos of 53 subjects, with ground-truth 3D models acquired using a structured-light scanning system. It is used to compare the accuracy of their 3D shape estimates.

2. **Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)**: This dataset is used for face recognition tasks and is mentioned multiple times in the results, indicating its importance in evaluating the robustness of their method.

3. **YouTube Faces (YTF)**: Another dataset used for face recognition, which is referenced in the context of evaluating their method's performance.

4. **IARPA Janus Benchmark-A (IJB-A)**: This dataset is also utilized for face recognition and is noted for its challenging conditions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
