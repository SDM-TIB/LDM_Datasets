To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Zero-shot spatial layout conditioning for text-to-image diffusion models" by Guillaume Couairon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors discuss improvements over previous methods and mention the **COCO dataset** as a benchmark for their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any explicit mentions of datasets. Here, the authors reference the **COCO-Stuff validation split**, which contains 5,000 images annotated with pixel-level segmentation masks across 171 classes. This is a significant dataset for their experiments.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Experimental setup)**, I will find more details about the datasets used. The authors confirm that they utilize the **COCO-Stuff dataset** for their evaluations, which aligns with the earlier mention in the introduction.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citation for the **COCO-Stuff dataset** is as follows:
> Holger Caesar, Jasper Uijlings, and Vittorio Ferrari. *COCO-Stuff: Thing and stuff classes in context*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the **COCO-Stuff dataset**, I will document this dataset in detail.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the necessary information regarding the datasets referenced in the paper.
