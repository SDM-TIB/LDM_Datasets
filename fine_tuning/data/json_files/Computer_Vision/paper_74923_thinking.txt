To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Advancing Artistic Typography through AI-Driven, User-Centric, and Multilingual WordArt Synthesis" by Jun-Yan He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a dataset of over 5,000 multilingual images, which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any detailed descriptions of datasets used. In this section, the authors mention a **Creative and Diverse WordArt Dataset** that they curated, which contains 5,000 multilingual images across various artistic styles and cultural elements. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is created by the authors themselves, it may not have an external citation. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper about the dataset, including its purpose and composition.

The dataset is described as follows:
- **Creative and Diverse WordArt Dataset**: This dataset includes 5,000 multilingual images, covering English, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, and spans a wide range of artistic styles and cultural elements. It is intended to support research in artistic typography and evaluate existing methods.

Since this dataset is original to the authors, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset. The citation for the paper is:
> Jun-Yan He, Zhi-Qi Cheng, Chenyang Li, Jingdong Sun, Wangmeng Xiang, Hanyuan Chen, Jin-Peng Lan, Xianhui Lin, Kang Zhu, Bin Luo, Yifeng Geng, Xuansong Xie, Alexander G. Hauptmann. *Advancing Artistic Typography through AI-Driven, User-Centric, and Multilingual WordArt Synthesis*. Preprint. Under review.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset extracted from the paper.
