To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NeurVPS: Neural Vanishing Point Scanning via Conic Convolution" by Yichao Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as it typically contains information about the datasets used. In this section, the authors explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Natural Scene Dataset**: This dataset consists of images from AVA and Flickr, containing 2,275 images divided into 2,000 training images and 275 test images. The authors note that the dataset does not include camera calibration information.

2. **ScanNet Dataset**: This is a 3D indoor environment dataset with 266,844 training images. The authors describe how they compute vanishing points for each RGB image based on the three orthogonal principal directions of the scenes.

3. **SU3 Wireframe Dataset**: This synthetic dataset contains 22,500 training images and 500 validation images. The authors mention that the vanishing points are computed directly from CAD models of buildings.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Natural Scene Dataset**:
  > Zihan Zhou, Farshid Farhat, and James Z Wang. *Detecting dominant vanishing points in natural scenes with application to composition-sensitive image retrieval*. IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, 2017.

- For the **ScanNet Dataset**:
  > Angela Dai, Angel X Chang, Manolis Savva, Maciej Halber, Thomas Funkhouser, and Matthias NieÃŸner. *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

- For the **SU3 Wireframe Dataset**:
  > Yichao Zhou, Haozhi Qi, Yuexiang Zhai, Qi Sun, Zhili Chen, Li-Yi Wei, and Yi Ma. *Learning to reconstruct 3D Manhattan wireframes from a single image*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use.
