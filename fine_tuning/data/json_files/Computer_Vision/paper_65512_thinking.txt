To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AUC-mixup: Deep AUC Maximization with Mixup" by Jianzhi Xv et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed method on "imbalanced benchmark and medical image datasets," which indicates that datasets are involved, but specific names are not provided.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for more details. Here, the authors mention that their method has been applied to large-scale medical image classification tasks, specifically referencing **Chexpert** and **Melanoma** datasets. This gives me a clue that these datasets are likely important for the experiments.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will look for a dedicated subsection on datasets. In this paper, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention several benchmark datasets, including:

1. **Cat&Dog**
2. **CIFAR-10**
3. **CIFAR-100**
4. **STL-10**

Additionally, they reference six medical image datasets from the **MEDMNIST** collection:

1. **PneumoniaMNIST (PneumoniaM)**
2. **BreastMNIST (BreastM)**
3. **NoduleMNIST3D (NoduleM)**
4. **AdrenalMNIST3D (AdrenalM)**
5. **VesselMNIST3D (VesselM)**
6. **SynapseMNIST3D (SynapseM)**

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. 

For the **Chexpert dataset**, the citation is:
> J. Irvin, P. Rajpurkar, M. Ko, Y. Yu, S. Ciurea-Ilcus, C. Chute, H. Marklund, B. Haghgoo, R. Ball, K. Shpanskaya, et al. *Chexpert: A large chest radiograph dataset with uncertainty labels and expert comparison*. In Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 33, pages 590â€“597, 2019.

For the **Melanoma dataset**, the citation is:
> V. Rotemberg, N. Kurtansky, B. Betz-Stablein, L. Caffery, E. Chousakos, N. Codella, M. Combalia, S. Dusza, P. Guitera, D. Gutman, et al. *A patient-centric dataset of images and metadata for identifying melanomas using clinical context*. Sci Data 8, 34 (2021).

For the **MEDMNIST datasets**, the citation is:
> J. Yang, R. Shi, D. Wei, Z. Liu, L. Zhao, B. Ke, H. Pfister, and B. Ni. *Medmnist v2-a large-scale lightweight benchmark for 2d and 3d biomedical image classification*. Scientific Data, 10(1):41, 2023.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
