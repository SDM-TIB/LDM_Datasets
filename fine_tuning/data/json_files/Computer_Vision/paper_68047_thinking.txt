To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Longitudinal Prediction of DNA Methylation to Forecast Epigenetic Outcomes" by Arthur Leroy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, results, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a birth cohort of children with methylation profiles, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, particularly where the authors discuss their framework's performance. They mention using the **GUSTO birth cohort** for their analysis, which is a clear indication of a dataset. I will look for specific details about this cohort, such as the number of subjects and the nature of the data collected.

In **section 4.1 (Description of the child cohort)**, the authors provide detailed information about the GUSTO cohort, stating that it includes about 1400 mother-child pairs with dense phenotypes. They specify that they selected 110 training subjects with longitudinal methylation data profiles at 3, 9, 48, and 72 months, and validated their model using another set of 188 testing subjects. This section confirms the existence of a dataset and provides context for its use.

Additionally, in **section 2.2**, the authors mention evaluating their method's performance over **188 testing individuals** and their corresponding methylation profiles of **368 and 91 CpGs** for the skin&blood and PedBE epigenetic clock datasets, respectively. This indicates that there are multiple datasets involved.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. **GUSTO birth cohort**:

2. **PedBE clock dataset**:

3. **Skin&blood clock dataset**:

Aging (Albany NY), 10(7):1758, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
