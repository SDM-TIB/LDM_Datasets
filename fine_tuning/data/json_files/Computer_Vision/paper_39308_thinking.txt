To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative-Discriminative Complementary Learning" by Yanwu Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention the datasets they evaluated their method on, which include:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
2. **CIFAR10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
3. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images.
4. **VGGFACE2**: A large-scale face recognition dataset with images of various individuals, varying in pose, age, and ethnicity.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MNIST**:
  > Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. 2010.

- For **CIFAR10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*. 2010.

- For **CIFAR100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-100 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*. 2010.

- For **VGGFACE2**:
  > Q. Cao, L. Shen, W. Xie, O. M. Parkhi, and A. Zisserman. *VGGFACE2: A dataset for recognising faces across pose and age*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
