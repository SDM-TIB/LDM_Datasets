To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Cause of Unfairness: A Training Sample Perspective" by Yuanshun Yao and Yang Liu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will pay close attention to **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section usually contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for the experiments. In this paper, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on **four datasets**: synthetic, COMPAS, Adult, and CelebA. I will extract relevant details about each dataset, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study.

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset is generated based on assumed causal graphs, which allows for the creation of ground-truth counterfactual samples. The authors describe the generation process in detail, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

2. **COMPAS Dataset**: This dataset is used for recidivism prediction and is preprocessed from IBM’s AIF360 toolkit. It includes tabular data where the label indicates recidivism within two years, and the sensitive attribute is race.

3. **Adult Dataset**: This dataset is used for income prediction and is also sourced from IBM’s AIF360 toolkit. It contains tabular data where the label indicates whether an individual's income exceeds $50K, with sex as the sensitive attribute.

4. **CelebA Dataset**: This is a facial image dataset used to predict attractiveness. The dataset includes images as features, with gender as the sensitive attribute.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

- For the **COMPAS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Angwin, J., Larson, J., Mattu, S., & Kirchner, L. (2016). *Machine bias*. In Ethics of Data and Analytics (pp. 254–264). Auerbach Publications.

- For the **Adult dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kohavi, R., et al. (1996). *Scaling up the accuracy of naive-bayes classifiers: A decision-tree hybrid*. In Proceedings of KDD (Vol. 96, pp. 202–207).

- For the **CelebA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of ICCV.

The synthetic dataset does not have a specific citation as it is generated based on the authors' own methodology.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited, ready for structured output or further processing.
