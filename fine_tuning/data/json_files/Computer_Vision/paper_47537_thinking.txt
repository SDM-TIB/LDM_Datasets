To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SceneGraphFusion: Incremental 3D Scene Graph Prediction from RGB-D Sequences" by Shun-Cheng Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the creation of a globally consistent 3D scene graph from RGB-D sequences, which suggests that datasets related to RGB-D images or 3D scenes might be involved. The introduction discusses the need for large-scale 3D datasets, indicating that specific datasets may be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors discuss their method and its evaluation, which typically includes references to the datasets used for training and testing.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention the use of the **ScanNet** dataset for their experiments. They state that they trained their network with the ScanNet dataset, which is a richly annotated 3D reconstruction dataset. This is a significant dataset for the context of their research.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ScanNet dataset. The citation for the ScanNet dataset is as follows:
> Angela Dai, Angel Xuan Chang, Manolis Savva, Maciej Halber, Tom Funkhouser, and Matthias Nießner. *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D Reconstructions of Indoor Scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

Additionally, the authors mention the **3DSSG dataset** in the context of evaluating their scene graph prediction task. I will look for its citation as well. The citation for the 3DSSG dataset is:
> Johanna Wald, Helisa Dhamo, Nassir Navab, and Federico Tombari. *Learning 3D Semantic Scene Graphs from 3D Indoor Reconstructions*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **ScanNet Dataset**: Used for training and evaluation of the proposed method.
   - Citation: Angela Dai, Angel Xuan Chang, Manolis Savva, Maciej Halber, Tom Funkhouser, and Matthias Nießner. *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D Reconstructions of Indoor Scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

2. **3DSSG Dataset**: Used for evaluating scene graph prediction.
   - Citation: Johanna Wald, Helisa Dhamo, Nassir Navab, and Federico Tombari. *Learning 3D Semantic Scene Graphs from 3D Indoor Reconstructions*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries for further processing or review.
