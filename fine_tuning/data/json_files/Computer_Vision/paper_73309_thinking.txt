To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Blaze3DM: Marry Triplane Representation with Diffusion for 3D Medical Inverse Problem Solving" by Jia He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on zero-shot 3D medical inverse problem solving," which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant subsections within the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments on four classic 3D medical inverse problem tasks: **sparse-view CT (SV-CT)**, **limited-angle CT (LA-CT)**, **compressed-sensing MRI (CS-MRI)**, and **MRI isotropic super-resolution (ZSR-MRI)**. This indicates that there are specific datasets associated with these tasks.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used:

1. **AAPM CT Dataset**: This dataset is used for the SV-CT and LA-CT tasks. It consists of 10 volumes of contrast-enhanced abdominal CT, with 9 volumes used for training and 1 for testing. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Cynthia H McCollough, Adam C Bartley, Rickey E Carter, Baiyu Chen, Tammy A Drees, Phillip Edwards, David R Holmes III, Alice E Huang, Farhana Khan, Shuai Leng, et al. *Low-dose ct for the detection and classification of metastatic liver lesions: results of the 2016 low dose ct grand challenge*. Medical physics, 44(10):e339â€“e352, 2017.

2. **IXI Dataset**: This dataset is used for the CS-MRI and ZSR-MRI tasks. It contains 3D multi-modal human brain scans, specifically using the T1-weighted modality data for training and testing. The citation for this dataset is:
   > IXI Dataset. Available at: http://brain-development.org/ixi-dataset/.

Now, I will ensure that I have the full citations for both datasets, as they are crucial for proper documentation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for any required structured output or further processing.
