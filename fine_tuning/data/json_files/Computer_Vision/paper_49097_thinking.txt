To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "MugRep: A Multi-Task Hierarchical Graph Representation Learning Framework for Real Estate Appraisal" by Weijia Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data description sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Data Description and Analysis)**, where the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used. They mention two primary datasets: **Beijing** and **Chengdu**, which are described in detail.

1. **Real Estate Marketing Data**: This dataset includes transaction records and community data for both Beijing and Chengdu. The authors specify the number of transactions and communities for each city:
   - **Beijing**: 185,151 transactions and 6,267 communities.
   - **Chengdu**: 1,315,353 transactions and 44,513 communities.

2. **Geographical Data**: This dataset includes point of interest (POI) and transport station data:
   - **Beijing**: 1,315,353 POIs and 44,513 transport stations.
   - **Chengdu**: 1,116,989 POIs and 30,564 transport stations.

3. **Check-in Data**: This dataset contains user check-in records:
   - **Beijing**: 4,078,723,999 check-ins.
   - **Chengdu**: 5,130,847,589 check-ins.

4. **User Trip Data**: This dataset records user trip queries:
   - **Beijing**: 73,307,426 trip queries.
   - **Chengdu**: 66,960,348 trip queries.

5. **User Profile Data**: This dataset includes user demographic attributes:
   - **Beijing**: 2,042,718 users.
   - **Chengdu**: 1,426,860 users.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets used, but it does mention that the Real Estate Marketing Data was collected from a major commercial real estate agency, which is referenced in the text.

Now, I will compile the dataset information along with the citations into a structured format. The citations for the datasets will be based on the context provided in the paper, and I will ensure to note that the Real Estate Marketing Data is sourced from a commercial agency without a specific citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and attributed correctly, ready for downstream processing or further analysis.
