To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarially Slicing Generative Networks: Discriminator Slices Feature for One-Dimensional Optimal Transport" by Yuhta Takida et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that "Experiments on synthetic and image datasets support our theoretical results," which indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the experiments section, the authors refer to "experiments on synthetic and image datasets," but I need to find the exact datasets used. 

I will also check the **figures and tables** for any references to datasets. For instance, if there are tables summarizing results, they might include dataset names or descriptions.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors conducted experiments on the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR10**: A well-known dataset for image classification, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.

2. **CelebA**: A large-scale face attributes dataset with over 200,000 celebrity images, each annotated with 40 attribute labels.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., and Tang, X. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 3730â€“3738, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
