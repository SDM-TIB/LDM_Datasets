To extract datasets from the research paper titled "QDCNN: Quantum Dilated Convolutional Neural Network" by Yixiong Chen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted empirical experiments on the **MNIST** and **Fashion-MNIST** datasets, which suggests these are the primary datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (specifically section 3) where the authors describe their experimental setup. In section 3.1.1, they explicitly mention the **MNIST** dataset and the **Fashion-MNIST** dataset, providing details about their structure and the number of samples. The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits, while the Fashion-MNIST dataset contains similar numbers of samples but features images of clothing items.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > L. Deng, “The MNIST database of handwritten digit images for machine learning research [best of the web],” IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, vol. 29, no. 6, pp. 141–142, 2012.

- For the **Fashion-MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > H. Xiao, K. Rasul, and R. Vollgraf, “Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms,” arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: A dataset of handwritten digits, consisting of 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples of 28x28 grayscale images.
   - Citation: L. Deng, “The MNIST database of handwritten digit images for machine learning research [best of the web],” IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, vol. 29, no. 6, pp. 141–142, 2012.

2. **Fashion-MNIST Dataset**: A dataset of clothing items, also containing 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples of 28x28 grayscale images.
   - Citation: H. Xiao, K. Rasul, and R. Vollgraf, “Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms,” arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
