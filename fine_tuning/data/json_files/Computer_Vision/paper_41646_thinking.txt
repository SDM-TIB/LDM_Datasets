To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Patch Reordering: a Novel Way to Achieve Rotation and Translation Invariance in Convolutional Neural Networks" by Xu Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method improves performance on several benchmark tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors discuss their evaluations on various tasks, including MNIST digit recognition, ImageNet-2012, and UK-Bench. I will need to confirm the details of these datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention the following datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method on handwritten digit recognition. It consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9) and is a standard benchmark in machine learning.

2. **ImageNet-2012 Dataset**: This dataset is a large-scale image classification dataset containing over 1.2 million images across 1,000 classes. It is widely used for benchmarking image recognition algorithms.

3. **UK-Bench Dataset**: This dataset is used for image retrieval tasks and consists of 2,550 groups of images, each containing 4 relevant samples of a certain object or scene from different viewpoints.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For the **ImageNet-2012 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

- For the **UK-Bench Dataset**, the citation is:
  > David Nister and Henrik Stewenius. *Scalable Recognition with a Vocabulary Tree*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2006.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its source.
