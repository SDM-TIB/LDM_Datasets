To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Orbital Facility Location Problem for Satellite Constellation Servicing Depots" by Yuri Shimane et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly any subsections that discuss data collection or experimental setups. This section often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for analysis or simulations.

In this paper, I will look for specific mentions of datasets related to satellite constellations, orbital parameters, or any numerical simulations conducted. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using the **GPS constellation data**, I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset. Similarly, if they refer to the **Galileo constellation data**, I will find its citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that the citations are formatted correctly and are complete, as this is essential for academic integrity and for readers who may wish to explore the datasets further.
