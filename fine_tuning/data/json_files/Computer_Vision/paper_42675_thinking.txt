To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Rotation-Invariant Framework for Deep Point Cloud Analysis" by Xianzhi Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the method on multiple point cloud analysis tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for any specific dataset names mentioned.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors evaluate their method on the **ModelNet40 dataset** for shape classification and the **ShapeNet dataset** for part segmentation. I will extract the details for these datasets:

1. **ModelNet40 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 12,311 CAD models from 40 categories, which is commonly used for 3D shape classification tasks.

2. **ShapeNet Dataset**: This dataset contains 16,881 models from 16 categories, annotated with 50 parts, and is used for part segmentation tasks.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

- For the **ModelNet40 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Z., Song, S., Khosla, A., Yu, F., Zhang, L., Tang, X., & Xiao, J. (2015). *3D ShapeNets: A deep representation for volumetric shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 1912-1920.

- For the **ShapeNet dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chang, A. X., Funkhouser, T., Guibas, L. J., Hanrahan, P., Huang, Q., Li, Z., Savarese, S., & Song, H. (2015). *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012.

Now that I have the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their relevant details from the paper.
