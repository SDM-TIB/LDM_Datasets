To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TFMQ-DM: Temporal Feature Maintenance Quantization for Diffusion Models" by Yushi Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting extensive experiments on various datasets and diffusion models, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved. However, I need to identify the specific datasets used.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using **seven standard benchmarks**: CIFAR-10, LSUN-Bedrooms, LSUN-Churches, CelebA-HQ, ImageNet, FFHQ, and MS-COCO. This is a clear indication of the datasets utilized in their research.

Now, I will gather detailed descriptions of each dataset from the text. The authors provide the following information:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **LSUN-Bedrooms**: A dataset with images of bedrooms, specifically designed for scene understanding tasks.
3. **LSUN-Churches**: A dataset containing images of churches, also aimed at scene understanding.
4. **CelebA-HQ**: A high-quality version of the CelebA dataset, which contains images of celebrity faces with various attributes.
5. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with millions of images across thousands of categories, widely used for image classification tasks.
6. **FFHQ**: The Flickr-Faces-HQ dataset, which contains high-quality images of human faces.
7. **MS-COCO**: A dataset that includes images with object annotations, commonly used for image captioning and object detection tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- **CIFAR-10**:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help in organizing the information effectively for further processing or review.
