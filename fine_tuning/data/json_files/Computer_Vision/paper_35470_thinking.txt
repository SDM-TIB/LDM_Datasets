To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decoupled Networks" by Weiyang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. In the abstract, I will look for any phrases that indicate the use of datasets, such as "we evaluated our method on" or "we used the following datasets."

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** of the paper, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and testing the models. I will look for a dedicated subsection that discusses datasets, often titled "Datasets" or something similar. This section should provide explicit names and descriptions of the datasets.

If the datasets are not clearly listed in the experiments section, I will check the **methodology** or **related works** sections, as authors sometimes reference datasets in the context of previous studies or methodologies.

Once I identify the datasets, I will take note of the following details for each dataset:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The official name as used in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains, including the number of samples, types of data (e.g., images, videos), and any relevant annotations.
3. **Full citation**: I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the complete citation for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, I would look for its description in the experiments section and then find its citation in the references. The citation for CIFAR-10 is typically:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2009.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will format the extracted information in a clear and organized manner, ready for further processing or review.
