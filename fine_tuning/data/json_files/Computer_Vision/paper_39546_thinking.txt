To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SEALion: a Framework for Neural Network Inference on Encrypted Data" by Tim van Elsloo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the framework and its applications, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of privacy in machine learning, particularly in medical applications, but again does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will look into the **experiments** and **applications** sections, as these are likely to contain references to datasets used for evaluation. In section 4 (Application: Sparsification of Neural Network Architectures), the authors mention evaluating their models on the **MNIST** dataset, which is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition. This is a significant dataset for their experiments.

In section 5 (Application: Encrypted Transfer Learning with Discretized VAE), the authors also mention using the **EMNIST** dataset, which is an extension of MNIST that includes handwritten letters. This indicates that both MNIST and EMNIST are utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

2. For the **EMNIST dataset**, the citation is:
   > Greg Cohen, Sam Afshar, James Tapson, and Andrew van Schaik. *EMNIST: an extension of MNIST to handwritten letters*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1702.05373, 2017.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
