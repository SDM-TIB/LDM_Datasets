To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Entropic Regression for Neurological Applications" by Jeremie Fish et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, results, and conclusions sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for mentions of specific datasets or data sources.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of time series data collected from nodes in the brain, which suggests that they may be using specific datasets related to brain imaging or connectivity. I will pay close attention to any named datasets or references to data sources.

Next, I will examine the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsection on "Structural Brain Networks." Here, the authors mention that they used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data to reconstruct the brain networks. They specify that the data comes from "Subject1" through "Subject20," indicating that these are specific datasets used in their analysis.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **results section**. The authors discuss the performance of their method on various network types, including Erdős-Rényi (ER) networks and small-world networks, but these are not datasets per se; they are models used for simulation.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the DTI data as being publicly available and reconstructed from previous work. I will identify the original source of the DTI data to provide a complete citation.

Based on my findings, I will compile the following datasets:

1. **Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) Data**: This dataset consists of brain connectivity data reconstructed from diffusion tensor imaging, specifically from subjects labeled "Subject1" to "Subject20." The authors indicate that this data is publicly available and was generated using methods described in a referenced paper.

I will now look up the original source of the DTI data to provide a full citation. The relevant reference is:

- **DTI Data Citation**: 
  > L. Bonilha, et al. "Reproducibility of the Structural Brain Connectome Derived from Diffusion Tensor Imaging." *PLoS One* 10, e0135247 (2015).

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets and their citations for further processing or review.
