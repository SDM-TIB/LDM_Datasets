To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Information Cascade Modeling by Social Topology and Dual Role User Dependency" by Baichuan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Baselines)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Twitter Dataset**: This dataset consists of tweets with URLs posted in October 2010, where tweets sharing the same URL are treated as an information cascade. 

2. **Douban Dataset**: This dataset is derived from a review-sharing website where each book is considered a piece of information. A user is activated in the cascade if they have read the book.

3. **MemeTracker Dataset**: This dataset collects news stories and blogs from various online sources, treating each meme as a piece of information. It does not include social topology.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that these datasets are used for evaluating their model, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets:

- For the **Twitter Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hodas, N.O., & Lerman, K. (2014). The simple rules of social contagion. *Scientific Reports*, 4, 4343.

- For the **Douban Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhong, E., Fan, W., Wang, J., Xiao, L., & Li, Y. (2012). Comsoc: adaptive transfer of user behaviors over composite social network. In *Proceedings of the KDD* (pp. 696–704).

- For the **MemeTracker Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Leskovec, J., Backstrom, L., & Kleinberg, J. (2009). Meme-tracking and the dynamics of the news cycle. In *Proceedings of KDD* (pp. 497–506).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation for reference. This structured approach will help in organizing the extracted data effectively for further processing or review.
