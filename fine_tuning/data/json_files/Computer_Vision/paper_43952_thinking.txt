To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Spatially Adaptive Convolution and Correlation" by Thomas W. Mitchel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for validation and testing. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any figures or tables that may summarize the datasets or their properties. If the authors refer to specific datasets in their experiments, I will note those down.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Ceramic-3 test dataset," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If the dataset is not directly cited, I will note the authors and title of the original dataset paper if mentioned in the text.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurate.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear format, ready for any further processing or presentation as needed.
