To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Guided Motion Diffusion for Controllable Human Motion Synthesis" by Korrawe Karunratanakul et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a high-level overview of the research and may mention key datasets used in the study. In this case, the introduction discusses the use of the **HumanML3D dataset**, which is a collection of text-annotated motion sequences.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention that they evaluate their model using the **HumanML3D dataset**, which contains 14,646 motions and 44,970 motion annotations. This is a critical piece of information that I need to document.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **HumanML3D dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Chuan Guo, Shihao Zou, Xinxin Zuo, Sen Wang, Wei Ji, Xingyu Li, and Li Cheng. *Generating diverse and natural 3D human motions from text*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 5152â€“5161, 2022.

Since this paper primarily focuses on the **HumanML3D dataset**, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
