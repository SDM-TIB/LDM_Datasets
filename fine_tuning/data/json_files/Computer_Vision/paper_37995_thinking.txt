To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Latent Space Optimal Transport for Generative Models" by Huidong Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the authors validate their method on the **MNIST** and **CelebA** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention using the **MNIST** dataset and the **CelebA** dataset for their evaluations. They also describe the nature of the experiments conducted on these datasets, which confirms their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
   > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

2. **CelebA Dataset**: The citation for the CelebA dataset is:
   > Z. Liu, P. Luo, X. Wang, and X. Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In ICCV, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits, commonly used for training various image processing systems.
- **CelebA Dataset**: A large-scale face attributes dataset with more than 200,000 celebrity images, each annotated with 40 attribute labels.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all information is accurately represented for future reference or processing.
