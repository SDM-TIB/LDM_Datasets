To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SealD-NeRF: Interactive Pixel-Level Editing for Dynamic Scenes by Neural Radiance Fields" by Zhentao Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for editing capabilities in implicit 3D models, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will look for more detailed information in the subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference various neural rendering techniques and mention the D-NeRF network, but again, no specific datasets are named. I will continue to the methodology and experiments sections for more concrete details.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention evaluating their implementation on the dataset released by D-NeRF. This indicates that there is a specific dataset used for their experiments, which I need to identify.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the D-NeRF dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **D-NeRF dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Pumarola, E. Corona, G. Pons-Moll, and F. Moreno-Noguer. *D-nerf: Neural radiance fields for dynamic scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2021, pp. 10 318â€“10 327.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the D-NeRF dataset is the primary dataset used in this research.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the D-NeRF dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. 

After completing this process, I will have a clear and structured output that includes the dataset information and its citation, ready for further processing or review.
