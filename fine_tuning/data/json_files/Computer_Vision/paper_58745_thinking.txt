To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TAX: Tendency-and-Assignment Explainer for Semantic Segmentation with Multi-Annotators" by Yuan-Chia Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on both synthetic and real-world datasets with multi-annotators, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Implementation Details)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **PASCAL VOC 2012**: This dataset contains 20 foreground classes and one background class, with a total of 10,582 training images, 1,449 validation images, and 1,456 testing images. The authors report the mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) across the 21 classes on the validation split.

2. **CVC-EndoSceneStill**: This dataset is used for endoluminal scene segmentation and is divided into 547 training images, 182 validation images, and 182 testing images. The authors also report the mIoU across the two classes on the testing split.

3. **LIDC-IDRI**: This dataset consists of 1,018 lung computed tomography (CT) scans, resulting in 8,882 training images, 1,996 validation images, and 1,992 testing images. Each image is annotated by four thoracic radiologists, and the authors follow a specific protocol for training data selection.

After identifying the datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **PASCAL VOC 2012**, the citation is:
  > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 2010.

- For **CVC-EndoSceneStill**, the citation is:
  > David V치zquez, Jorge Bernal, F Javier S치nchez, Gloria Fern치ndez-Esparrach, Antonio M L칩pez, Adriana Romero, Michal Drozdzal, and Aaron Courville. *A Benchmark for Endoluminal Scene Segmentation of Colonoscopy Images*. Journal of Healthcare Engineering, 2017.

- For **LIDC-IDRI**, the citation is:

Medical Physics, 2011.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
