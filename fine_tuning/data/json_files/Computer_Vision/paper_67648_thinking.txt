To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AD-PT: Autonomous Driving Pre-Training with Large-scale Point Cloud Dataset" by Jiakang Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the creation of a large-scale point cloud dataset for autonomous driving, which suggests that a specific dataset is likely referenced.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology** and **experiments** sections. In the introduction, the authors mention the use of the **ONCE dataset**, which is described as a large-scale point cloud dataset. This is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail their evaluation on several benchmarks, specifically mentioning the **Waymo**, **nuScenes**, and **KITTI** datasets. I will note these as they are commonly used datasets in the field of autonomous driving.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **ONCE Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Jiageng Mao, Minzhe Niu, Chenhan Jiang, Hanxue Liang, Jingheng Chen, Xiaodan Liang, Yamin Li, Chaoqiang Ye, Wei Zhang, Zhenguo Li, et al. *One million scenes for autonomous driving: Once dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.11037, 2021.

2. **Waymo Open Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Pei Sun, Henrik Kretzschmar, Xerxes Dotiwalla, Aurelien Chouard, Vijaysai Patnaik, Paul Tsui, James Guo, Yin Zhou, Yuning Chai, Benjamin Caine, et al. *Scalability in perception for autonomous driving: Waymo open dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 2446–2454, 2020.

3. **nuScenes Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yu Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *nuscenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 11621–11631, 2020.

4. **KITTI Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? the kitti vision benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3354–3361, 2012.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
