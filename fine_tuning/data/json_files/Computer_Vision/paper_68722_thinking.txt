To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding Heterophily for Graph Neural Networks" by Junfu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, classes, or features.

In this paper, the authors mention using **synthetic data generated from their proposed Heterophilous Stochastic Block Models (HSBM)** and also refer to **real-world datasets**. I will need to identify the specific real-world datasets they used.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

From the text, I note that the authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset commonly used for benchmarking in graph neural networks.
2. **Chameleon**: A dataset from Wikipedia used for node classification tasks.
3. **Actor**: A co-occurrence network dataset.
4. **Amazon-ratings**: A co-purchasing network dataset.
5. **Squirrel**: Another dataset from Wikipedia.
6. **Workers**: A crowdsourcing co-working network dataset.
7. **Arxiv-year**: A citation network dataset from Arxiv.
8. **Snap-patents**: A patent network dataset.

Next, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper. For example, the citation for the Cora dataset is typically attributed to:

> Yang, Y., Cohen, W. W., & Salakhutdinov, R. (2016). *Semi-supervised learning with graph embeddings*. In Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML).

I will repeat this process for each dataset mentioned in the paper to ensure I have the correct and complete citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including names, descriptions, and citations, into a structured format for easy reference and use in future research or applications.
