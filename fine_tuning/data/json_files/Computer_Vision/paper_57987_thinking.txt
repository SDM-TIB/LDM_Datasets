To extract datasets from the research paper titled "High Altitude Platform Station (HAPS)-Aided GNSS for Urban Areas" by Hongzhao Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the positioning performance of a HAPS-aided GPS system, but it does not specify any datasets directly. 

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** where the authors describe their simulation and physical experiments. In this section, they mention using raw GNSS data collected along a vehicle trajectory, which suggests that there is a dataset involved in their experiments.

In **section IV (Field Experiments)**, the authors specify that they collected raw GNSS data using the Ublox EVK-M8T GNSS unit. This indicates that the data collected during their experiments is a key dataset. They also mention that the data was processed using a single point positioning package developed by Napat Tongkasem, which may also be relevant.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the Ublox EVK-M8T GNSS unit, which is crucial for understanding the dataset used in their experiments. The citation for this unit is:

- For **Ublox EVK-M8T GNSS unit**:
  > “EVK-M8T user guide,” Ublox, May 2018. Accessed on: Jul. 9, 2022. Available: https://content.u-blox.com/sites/default/files/products/documents/EVK-M8T_UserGuide_%28UBX-14041540%29.pdf

Additionally, the authors refer to the simulation software used, which is the Skydel GNSS simulation software. The citation for this software is:

- For **Skydel GNSS Simulation Software**:
  > “Skydel GNSS Simulation Software,” Orolia, Available: https://www.orolia.com/product/skydel-simulation-engine/.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Raw GNSS Data**: Collected using the Ublox EVK-M8T GNSS unit along a vehicle trajectory in both suburban and dense urban areas.
2. **Simulation Data**: Generated using the Skydel GNSS simulation software to model the HAPS-aided GPS system.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the full citations for each dataset, ensuring that all relevant information is accurately represented for further processing or review.
