To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GCN-WP – Semi-Supervised Graph Convolutional Networks for Win Prediction in Esports" by Alexander J. Bisberg and Emilio Ferrara, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the model and its application, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Dataset)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the study. In this section, the authors describe the data collection process and the features included in their datasets. They mention that the dataset was aggregated by a reputable blog called Oracle’s Elixir, managed by Tim Sevenhuysen, and that it contains detailed information about professional League of Legends games from 2014 to the present.

The authors specify that they constructed two datasets:
1. **Raw Dataset**: This dataset contains raw feature values for each team.
2. **Delta Dataset**: This dataset includes the difference in feature values between the two teams.

I will also note that the authors emphasize the importance of using regular season games for their analysis, as this provides a larger sample size and a more consistent cohort of teams.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset source. The relevant citation for the dataset is:
- For the dataset from Oracle’s Elixir:
  > Tim Sevenhuysen. *Oracle’s Elixir*. 2020. Available: https://oracleselixir.com/tools/downloads

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation. This will allow for proper attribution and facilitate further research or validation of the findings presented in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.
