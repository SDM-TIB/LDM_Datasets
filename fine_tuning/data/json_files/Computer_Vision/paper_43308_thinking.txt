To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Auto-Encoder Strategy for Adaptive Image Segmentation" by Evan M. Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed method to brain MRI scans, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention that they evaluated their method on **T1-weighted 3D brain MRI scans**. They specify that the total number of subjects was 38, with 30 used for training and 8 for testing. This indicates that the dataset is comprised of MRI scans, but I need to find the exact source or citation for this dataset.

In the same section, the authors refer to two atlases used in their experiments:

1. **Atlas1**: This atlas is based on a single unpaired segmentation image obtained from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS), which was automatically segmented using FreeSurfer. This indicates that the dataset is derived from OASIS.

2. **Atlas2**: This atlas is a publicly available probabilistic atlas computed based on 20 manually labeled subjects, specifically cited as coming from Puonti et al. (2016).

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS)**, the citation is:
  > Marcus et al. *Open access series of imaging studies (OASIS): cross-sectional MRI data in young, middle aged, nondemented, and demented older adults*. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 2007.

- For the **probabilistic atlas** used in Atlas2, the citation is:
  > Oula Puonti, Juan Eugenio Iglesias, and Koen Van Leemput. *Fast and sequence-adaptive whole-brain segmentation using parametric bayesian modeling*. NeuroImage, 143:235â€“249, 2016.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: OASIS
   - **Description**: A dataset of cross-sectional MRI data in young, middle-aged, nondemented, and demented older adults.
   - **Citation**: Marcus et al. (2007).

2. **Dataset Name**: Probabilistic Atlas
   - **Description**: A probabilistic atlas computed based on 20 manually labeled subjects for brain segmentation.
   - **Citation**: Puonti et al. (2016).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its corresponding citation.
