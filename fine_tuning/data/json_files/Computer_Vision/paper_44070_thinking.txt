To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Noticing Motion Patterns: A Temporal CNN with a Novel Convolution Operator for Human Trajectory Prediction" by Dapeng Zhao and Jean Oh, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the model is evaluated on public datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Evaluation and Discussion)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that their model is evaluated on two datasets, which contain a total of 1,536 pedestrians exhibiting complex interactions. This section is crucial as it will provide the names of the datasets.

Upon reviewing section IV, I find that the datasets are referenced as [18] and [19]. I will now look at the **References section** to obtain the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the first dataset, referenced as [18], the citation is:
   > S. Pellegrini, A. Ess, K. Schindler, and L. Van Gool. "You’ll never walk alone: Modeling social behavior for multi-target tracking." In 2009 IEEE 12th International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 261–268, 2009.

2. For the second dataset, referenced as [19], the citation is:
   > A. Lerner, Y. Chrysanthou, and D. Lischinski. "Crowds by example." In Computer Graphics Forum, vol. 26, no. 3, pp. 655–664, 2007.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset, ensuring to include the citation details as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
