To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Manifold Regularization with GANs for Semi-Supervised Learning" by Bruno Lecouat et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art results on **CIFAR-10** and **SVHN** benchmarks, suggesting that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (specifically section 4) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets. In section 4.1, the authors mention that they separated 10% of the training data on CIFAR-10 into a validation set and did similarly for SVHN. This confirms that both datasets are indeed used for their experiments.

In section 4.2, the authors provide further context about the datasets, stating that they performed semi-supervised training using a small fraction of labeled training data from CIFAR-10 and SVHN. This reinforces the importance of these datasets in their methodology.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, 2009.

2. **SVHN**: The citation is:
   > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. NIPS, 2011.

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- **SVHN**: A real-world image dataset for digit recognition, consisting of over 600,000 labeled digits.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation for clarity and proper attribution.
