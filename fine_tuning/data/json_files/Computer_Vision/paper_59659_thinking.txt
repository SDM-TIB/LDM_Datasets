To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Set-the-Scene: Global-Local Training for Generating Controllable NeRF Scenes" by Dana Cohen-Bar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the generation of controllable scenes from text prompts and 3D object proxies, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** more closely, particularly looking for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation. In this section, the authors describe their method and results, but they do not seem to provide specific dataset names or details.

I will also check the **related work section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of previous studies. This section discusses various methods and approaches in the field, but again, it does not provide specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will look at the **references section** to see if any of the cited works include datasets that might be relevant to the methods discussed in this paper. However, the references primarily cite other research papers and methods rather than specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors do not provide specific datasets used in their experiments. They focus more on the methodology and the results of their approach rather than detailing the datasets. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

In summary, I will note that while the paper discusses a novel method for generating controllable scenes, it does not specify any datasets used for training or evaluation, and thus, there are no dataset citations to provide.
