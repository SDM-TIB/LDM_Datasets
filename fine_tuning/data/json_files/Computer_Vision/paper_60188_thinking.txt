To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fracture Detection in Pediatric Wrist Trauma X-ray Images Using YOLOv8 Algorithm" by Rui-Yang Ju and Weiming Cai, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a pediatric wrist trauma X-ray dataset (GRAZPEDWRI-DX), which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. Here, the authors describe the GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset, stating that it consists of 20,327 X-ray images collected from 6,091 patients, annotated in 9 different classes. This section provides essential information about the dataset's size and purpose.

I will also check the **related work section** to see if any other datasets are referenced. The authors mention several studies that utilized different datasets for fracture detection, such as the Musculoskeletal-Radiograph (MURA) dataset, which is relevant to the context but not the primary dataset used in this paper.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset. The relevant citation is:
> Nagy, E., Janisch, M., Hrži´c, F., Sorantin, E. & Tschauner, S. A pediatric wrist trauma x-ray dataset (grazpedwri-dx) for machine learning. *Sci. Data* 9, 222 (2022).

Additionally, I will note that the authors reference the MURA dataset, which has its own citation:
> Rajpurkar, P. et al. Mura dataset: Towards radiologist-level abnormality detection in musculoskeletal radiographs. In *Medical Imaging with Deep Learning* (2018).

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The primary dataset is GRAZPEDWRI-DX, and the MURA dataset is mentioned for context but is not used in the experiments of this paper.

This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets and their citations from the research paper.
