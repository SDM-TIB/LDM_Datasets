To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adapt and Align to Improve Zero-Shot Sketch-Based Image Retrieval" by Shiyin Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Sketchy Dataset**: This dataset is described as a large-scale collection of aligned sketch-image pairs, specifically the extended version containing 75,471 sketches and 73,002 natural images across 125 categories. The authors reference a specific split method for training and testing.

2. **TU-Berlin Dataset**: This dataset consists of 20,000 sketches over 250 categories, along with 13,419 natural images. The authors note that additional images were collected to create a total of 204,489 photos, and they specify the categories used for training and testing.

3. **QuickDraw Dataset**: This dataset is a large collection of drawings from the Quick, Draw! game, containing sketches from 345 categories. The authors mention that they selected 110 categories for their experiments, which included 330,000 sketches and 204,000 images.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

- For the **Sketchy Dataset**, the citation is:
  > P. Sangkloy, N. Burnell, C. Ham, and J. Hays. "The sketchy database: learning to retrieve badly drawn bunnies." ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), vol. 35, no. 4, pp. 1–12, 2016.

- For the **TU-Berlin Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Eitz, J. Hays, and M. Alexa. "How do humans sketch objects?" ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), vol. 31, no. 4, pp. 1–10, 2012.

- For the **QuickDraw Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Ha and J. Eck. "A Neural Representation of Sketch Drawings." arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.03477, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
