To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Evaluate the Artness of AI-generated Images" by Junyu Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a dataset for evaluating artness levels, which suggests that there is a specific dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsections that describe how the dataset was created. The authors mention generating a pseudo-annotated artness dataset using StyleGAN models. They describe the process of generating images with varying levels of artness, which implies that the dataset consists of these generated images.

In the **results section**, the authors provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of sequences generated for different domains (face, horse, landscape). This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and structure.

I will also check the **references section** to find citations for any datasets mentioned. The authors refer to several datasets used for training and evaluation, including:

1. **WikiART Dataset**: This dataset is used for collecting art paintings for training the StyleGAN models. The citation is:
   > Nichol, K. (2016). *Painter by numbers, wikiart*. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/c/painter-by-numbers.

2. **FFHQ Dataset**: This dataset is used for photorealistic images. The citation is:
   > Karras, T., Laine, S., & Aila, T. (2019). *A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

3. **LSUN Dataset**: This dataset is used for horse images. The citation is:
   > Yu, F., Seff, A., Zhang, Y., Song, S., Funkhouser, T., & Xiao, J. (2015). *LSUN: Construction of a large-scale image dataset using deep learning with humans in the loop*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.03365.

4. **LHQ Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned for training purposes. The citation is:
   > Skorokhodov, I., Sotnikov, G., & Elhoseiny, M. (2021). *Aligning latent and image spaces to connect the uncon-nectable*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described clearly and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
