To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Representation Learning for Acoustic Parameter Estimation" by Philipp Götz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the evaluation of embeddings across three different downstream tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various tasks in acoustic scene analysis, including the estimation of room-acoustic parameters and environment classification. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets yet.

Next, I will focus on the **data generation section (3.3)**, where the authors describe how they constructed their datasets. They mention using the **LibriSpeech ASR corpus** to create two fully disjoint datasets for upstream and downstream training. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

The authors specify that for the upstream training, they simulated room impulse responses (RIRs) from 64 different rooms and convolved them with anechoic speech segments to generate a total of 8192, 2048, and 2048 reverberant speech samples for training, validation, and testing, respectively. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset, so I will refer to it as the "Upstream Reverberant Speech Dataset."

For the downstream dataset, they mention generating the same number of samples as in the upstream case, but with RIRs selected from a dataset of 1000 RIRs from 100 different rooms. This dataset will be referred to as the "Downstream Reverberant Speech Dataset."

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **LibriSpeech ASR corpus**:

- The citation for the **LibriSpeech ASR corpus** is:
  > Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. *Librispeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206–5210, 2015.

Since the paper does not provide specific citations for the simulated datasets (Upstream and Downstream Reverberant Speech Datasets), I will note that these datasets are derived from the authors' own data generation process and do not have formal citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the LibriSpeech ASR corpus and document the other datasets as described.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and organized representation of the datasets extracted from the paper, ready for further processing or review.
