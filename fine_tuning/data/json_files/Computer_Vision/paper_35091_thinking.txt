To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Roto-Translation Covariant Convolutional Networks for Medical Image Analysis" by Erik J Bekkers et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method on three different problems in medical imaging, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments and results section**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for the experiments. Here, the authors mention three specific tasks: mitosis detection, vessel segmentation, and cell boundary segmentation. I will look for the datasets associated with each of these tasks.

1. **AMIDA13 Dataset**: This dataset is used for mitosis detection in histopathology images. The authors state that it consists of high power field images from 23 breast cancer cases. I will note down the details and look for the full citation in the references section.

2. **DRIVE Database**: This dataset is utilized for vessel segmentation in retinal images. The authors mention that it consists of 40 retinal images with manual segmentations. I will also look for the full citation for this dataset.

3. **ISBI EM Segmentation Challenge Dataset**: This dataset is used for cell boundary segmentation in electron microscopy. The authors describe it as containing 2 volumes, each with 30 consecutive images. I will find the citation for this dataset as well.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **AMIDA13 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Veta, M., van Diest, P., Willems, S., et al. *Assessment of algorithms for mitosis detection in breast cancer histopathology images*. MEDIA 20(1) (2015) 237–248.

- For the **DRIVE Database**, the citation is:
  > Staal, J., Abramoﬀ, M.D., Niemeijer, M., et al. *Ridge-based vessel segmentation in color images of the retina*. IEEE TMI 23(4) (2004) 501–509.

- For the **ISBI EM Segmentation Challenge Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Arganda-Carreras, I., Turaga, S.C., et al. *Crowdsourcing the creation of image segmentation algorithms for connectomics*. Front. in neuroanatomy 9 (2015) 142.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
