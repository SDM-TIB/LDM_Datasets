To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fair Sampling in Diffusion Models through Switching Mechanism" by Yujin Choi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is demonstrated on various datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention using the **FairFace** and **CelebA** datasets. I will take note of the specific attributes they focus on within these datasets, such as "race" for FairFace and "gender" and "makeup" for CelebA.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

The citations I will extract are:

1. **FairFace Dataset**:
   > Karkkainen, K., & Joo, J. (2021). FairFace: Face Attribute Dataset for Balanced Race, Gender, and Age for Bias Measurement and Mitigation. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision, 1548â€“1558.

2. **CelebA Dataset**:
   > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild. In Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **FairFace Dataset**: This dataset is used to evaluate fairness in terms of race, gender, and age attributes.
- **CelebA Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for evaluating attributes related to gender and makeup.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
