To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SeaThru-NeRF: Neural Radiance Fields in Scattering Media" by Deborah Levy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method using "simulated and real-world scenes," which suggests that there are datasets involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (section 5) to find detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, the authors describe their experiments with real-world scenes acquired from three different seas: the Red Sea, the Caribbean Sea, and the Pacific Sea. They mention that they collected a total of 20 images from each of the Red Sea and Caribbean Sea, and 18 images from the Pacific Sea. This indicates that these images form a dataset for their experiments.

I will also look for any specific dataset names or references to existing datasets in the **related work** or **scientific background** sections. However, it appears that the authors primarily focus on their own data collection rather than referencing established datasets.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets:

1. **Real-world underwater scenes**: This dataset consists of images collected from three different locations:
   - **Red Sea**: 20 images
   - **Caribbean Sea**: 20 images
   - **Pacific Sea**: 18 images

2. **Simulated Scene**: The authors mention using the Fern scene from the LLFF dataset for their simulations. This indicates that they utilized an existing dataset for their simulated experiments.

Next, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **LLFF dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P. Srinivasan, Rodrigo Ortiz-Cayon, Nima Khademi Kalantari, Ravi Ramamoorthi, Ren Ng, and Abhishek Kar. *Local light field fusion: Practical view synthesis with prescriptive sampling guidelines*. TOG, 2019.

Since the real-world datasets do not have formal citations as they are original collections by the authors, I will note them as such.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring that I include the full citations for any referenced datasets. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
