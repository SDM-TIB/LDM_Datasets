To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Seeing in Flowing: Adapting CLIP for Action Recognition with Motion Prompts Learning" by Qiang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted extensive experiments on **HMDB-51, UCF-101, and Kinetics-400 datasets**, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. They mention:

1. **HMDB-51**: This dataset contains approximately 7,000 videos across 51 action categories. The authors specify that they used three standard splits for training and testing, with 3,570 videos for training and 1,530 for testing.

2. **UCF-101**: This dataset consists of around 13,000 videos related to 101 actions. The authors also mention using three standard splits, with 9,537 videos for training and 3,783 for testing.

3. **Kinetics-400**: This dataset includes more than 240,000 videos collected from YouTube, with around 230,000 videos used for training and about 19,000 for testing.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **HMDB-51**, the citation is:
  > Hildegard Kuehne, Hueihan Jhuang, Estíbaliz Garrote, Tomaso Poggio, and Thomas Serre. *HMDB: a large video database for human motion recognition*. In 2011 International conference on computer vision. IEEE, 2556–2563, 2011.

- For **UCF-101**, the citation is:
  > Khurram Soomro, Amir Roshan Zamir, and Mubarak Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.

- For **Kinetics-400**, the citation is:
  > Will Kay, Joao Carreira, Karen Simonyan, Brian Zhang, Chloe Hillier, Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan, Fabio Viola, Tim Green, Trevor Back, Paul Natsev, et al. *The kinetics human action video dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.06950, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
