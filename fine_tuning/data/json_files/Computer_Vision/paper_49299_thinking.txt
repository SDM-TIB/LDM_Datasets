To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CCGL: Contrastive Cascade Graph Learning" by Xovee Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper, as these sections typically provide insights into the datasets used. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on **five real-world datasets**. This indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to identify.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. They mention the following datasets:

1. **Weibo Dataset**: This dataset is used for retweet cascades, and the authors specify the observation and prediction times for the cascades.

2. **Twitter Dataset**: Similar to the Weibo dataset, this dataset is used for hashtag cascades, with defined observation and prediction times.

3. **ACM Dataset**: This dataset consists of citation cascades from the Association for Computing Machinery, with specific observation and prediction times mentioned.

4. **APS Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the American Physical Society and contains citation cascades, with defined observation and prediction times.

5. **DBLP Dataset**: This dataset is from the DBLP citation network, also with specified observation and prediction times.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Weibo Dataset**: 
  > Weng, L., Menczer, F., & Ahn, Y.-Y. (2013). Virality prediction and community structure in social networks. *Scientific Reports*, 3, 2522.

- **Twitter Dataset**: 
  > Yang, C., Wang, H., Tang, J., Shi, C., Sun, M., Cui, G., & Liu, Z. (2021). Full-scale information diffusion prediction with reinforced recurrent networks. *TNNLS*, 13 pages, in press.

- **ACM Dataset**: 
  > Zhou, F., Xu, X., Trajcevski, G., & Zhang, K. (2017). DeepCas: An end-to-end predictor of information cascades. In *WWW*, 577–586.

- **APS Dataset**: 
  > Chen, X., Zhou, F., Zhang, K., Trajcevski, G., & Zhong, T. (2019). Information diffusion prediction via recurrent cascades convolution. In *ICDE*, 770–781.

  > Tang, J., Zhang, J., Yao, L., Li, J., Zhang, L., & Su, Z. (2008). ArnetMiner: Extraction and mining of academic social networks. In *KDD*, 990–998.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
