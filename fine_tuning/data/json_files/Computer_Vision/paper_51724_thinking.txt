To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Deep PnP Algorithm for Video Snapshot Compressive Imaging" by Zongliang Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed algorithm is validated on "both simulation and real datasets," which indicates that there are datasets used for evaluation. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) closely, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. In this section, the authors mention using a "mid-scale color RGB video testing dataset" and provide a list of specific scenes: **Beauty, Bosphorus, Jockey, ShakeNDry, Runner, and Traffic**. This gives me the names of the datasets used in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The authors reference a dataset from the **DAIVS 2017** for training their deep demosaicing network, which is important to note. The specific citation for this dataset is:

- **DAIVS 2017 Dataset**: 
  > Perazzi, F., Pont-Tuset, J., McWilliams, B., Van Gool, L., Gross, M., & Sorkine-Hornung, A. (2016). *A benchmark dataset and evaluation methodology for video object segmentation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (pp. 724–732).

Additionally, I will note that the authors mention using "real datasets captured by SCI cameras," but they do not specify the names of these datasets in the paper. Therefore, I will focus on the datasets explicitly mentioned.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as I prepare to format them according to the required structure.

1. **Mid-scale Color RGB Video Testing Dataset**:
   - Datasets: Beauty, Bosphorus, Jockey, ShakeNDry, Runner, Traffic
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided in the paper, but they are part of the evaluation methodology.

2. **DAIVS 2017 Dataset**:
   - Citation: 
   > Perazzi, F., Pont-Tuset, J., McWilliams, B., Van Gool, L., Gross, M., & Sorkine-Hornung, A. (2016). *A benchmark dataset and evaluation methodology for video object segmentation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (pp. 724–732).

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations before proceeding to format them into the required output structure.
