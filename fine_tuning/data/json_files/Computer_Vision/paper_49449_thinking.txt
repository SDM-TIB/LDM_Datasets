To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Image reconstruction in light-sheet microscopy: spatially varying deconvolution and mixed noise" by Bogdan Toader et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and it may mention specific datasets used for validation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference datasets used in previous studies or their own experiments. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets.

In the **numerical results section**, the authors typically provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. I will pay close attention to any figures or tables that may accompany the text, as these often summarize key datasets and their characteristics.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

From my reading, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **Simulated Data**: The authors describe a simulated dataset consisting of images of various sizes and characteristics, specifically designed to test their deconvolution method. The details of this dataset will be summarized, including its dimensions and the types of images included.

2. **Light-sheet Data**: The authors mention using real experimental data from light-sheet microscopy, specifically images of fluorescent beads and a Marchantia sample. I will note the dimensions of these images and any relevant details about the acquisition process.

Finally, I will compile the full citations for each dataset as follows:

- For the **simulated data**, since it is generated by the authors, I will note that it is part of their experimental setup and does not have a formal citation.
  
- For the **light-sheet data**, I will reference the original sources of the biological samples used, if mentioned in the paper.

Once I have gathered all this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its characteristics and full citation, ready for inclusion in any structured output or further analysis.
