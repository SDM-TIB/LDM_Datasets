To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gender Bias in Depression Detection Using Audio Features" by Andrew Bailey and Mark D. Plumbley, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss datasets** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the **Distress Analysis Interview Corpus - Wizard of Oz (DAIC-WOZ)** dataset, indicating that this is a key dataset for the research.

Next, I will look closely at the **introduction** where the authors describe the DAIC-WOZ dataset in detail. They mention that it contains interviews from 189 participants, with specific classifications for those diagnosed with depression and those who are not. This section provides context for the dataset's purpose and its relevance to the study.

In **Section II (DAIC-WOZ, Depression Detection, and Fairness)**, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the DAIC-WOZ dataset, including how it was collected and its structure. They detail the number of interviews, the classification of participants, and the method of obtaining ground truth labels through the Patient Health Questionnaire 8 (PHQ-8). This section confirms that DAIC-WOZ is the primary dataset used in their analysis.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DAIC-WOZ dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **DAIC-WOZ Dataset**:
  > J. Gratch et al., “The distress analysis interview corpus of human and computer interviews,” in Proc. LREC, Reykjavik, May 2014, pp. 3123–3128.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the DAIC-WOZ dataset, I will ensure to document this dataset thoroughly, including its purpose, structure, and citation.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset details along with the full citation, ensuring that all necessary information is included for future reference or analysis.
