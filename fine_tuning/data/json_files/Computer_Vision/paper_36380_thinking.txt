To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Summable Reparameterizations of Wasserstein Critics in the One-Dimensional Setting" by Christopher Grimm et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on generative adversarial networks (GANs) and their applications, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where datasets are typically described. In this section, the authors mention evaluating their method against three different synthetic data sources and one real-world data source. The synthetic datasets are:

1. **Sawtooth Distribution**: This dataset is generated from a sawtooth function, which is a common synthetic distribution used for testing.

2. **Discrete Distribution**: This dataset consists of three possible values, generated based on a uniform distribution.

3. **Mixture of Two Gaussian Distributions**: This dataset is created by mixing two Gaussian distributions, which is another standard synthetic dataset used in experiments.

The real-world dataset mentioned is:

4. **City Populations from the Free World Cities Database**: This dataset contains population data for various cities, which has been pre-processed by applying logarithmic scaling and normalization.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the synthetic datasets are commonly used and may not have formal citations, I will focus on the real-world dataset citation:

- For the **Free World Cities Database**, the citation is:
  > MaxMind. *Free World Cities Database*. Available at: https://www.maxmind.com/en/free-world-cities-database.

Since the synthetic datasets do not have specific citations, I will note them as commonly used datasets in the field without formal references.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the real-world dataset and describe the synthetic datasets appropriately.

This process will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper while adhering to the importance of proper citation.
