To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretable Categorization of Heterogeneous Time Series Data" by Ritchie Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their method to the **Australian Sign Language dataset** and data on **near mid-air collisions (NMACs)**, which suggests that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors provide specific information about the datasets used:

1. **Australian Sign Language Dataset**: This dataset is described as originating from participants wearing instrumented gloves while signing specific words in Australian sign language. It contains 22 continuous attributes and includes 95 words with 27 examples each, focusing on eight words: hello, please, yes, no, right, wrong, same, and different.

2. **NMAC Dataset**: This dataset consists of simulated two-aircraft mid-air encounters, containing 10,000 encounters with 863 NMACs and 9,137 non-NMACs. Each encounter has 77 attributes collected at 1 Hz for 50 time steps, representing various states of the aircraft and the collision avoidance system.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Australian Sign Language dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Lichman, UCI machine learning repository, 2013.

- For the **NMAC dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Lee, M. J. Kochenderfer, O. J. Mengshoel, G. P. Brat, and M. P. Owen. *Adaptive stress testing of airborne collision avoidance systems*. In Proceedings of the Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC), 2015.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
