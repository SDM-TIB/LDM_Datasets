To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heterogeneous Information Network-based Interest Composition with Graph Neural Network for Recommendation" by Dengcheng Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on **three real-world datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **Amazon Dataset**: This dataset records users' purchase history and includes auxiliary item information such as brand and category.

2. **Douban Movie Dataset**: This dataset contains interactions between users and movies, along with auxiliary information about movies such as actors, directors, and tags.

3. **YELP Dataset**: This dataset includes users' reviews on businesses and the business attribute information such as business category.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are commonly used in research, they may not have specific citations provided in the paper. In this case, I will note that they are widely recognized datasets in the recommendation system community.

Now, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and citations:

- For the **Amazon Dataset**, I will note that it is widely used in recommendation research but may not have a specific citation in this paper.

- For the **Douban Movie Dataset**, I will also note its common usage in the field without a specific citation.

- For the **YELP Dataset**, similarly, I will mention its common recognition in recommendation research.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and any available citations or notes about their common usage in the field.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
