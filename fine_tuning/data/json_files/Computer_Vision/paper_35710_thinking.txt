To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Multiple Instance Learning for Zero-shot Image Tagging" by Shaﬁn Rahman and Salman Khan, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors experiment with the **NUS-WIDE dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is significant for their research. I will note this down as a primary dataset.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to gather more details about the dataset. In section 4.1, the authors provide a comprehensive description of the **NUS-WIDE dataset**, stating that it contains 269,648 images with three sets of tags from Flickr. They specify that they use the first set of 81 tags as unseen and the second set for seen tags, which is crucial for understanding how the dataset is utilized in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the NUS-WIDE dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Chua, T.S., Tang, J., Hong, R., Li, H., Luo, Z., Zheng, Y.T. (2009). *NUS-WIDE: A real-world web image database from national university of Singapore*. In: Proc. of ACM Conf. on Image and Video Retrieval (CIVR’09), Santorini, Greece.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **NUS-WIDE Dataset**: This dataset is used for the experiments in the paper, containing a large number of images with multiple tags. It is significant for zero-shot image tagging tasks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the NUS-WIDE dataset as it is essential for proper referencing in any downstream applications or analyses.
