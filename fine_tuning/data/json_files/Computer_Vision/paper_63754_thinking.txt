To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-Redundant Combination of Hand-Crafted and Deep Learning Radiomics: Application to the Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer" by Rebeca VÃ©til et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their method on a "large independent test set," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In this section, they mention that data were obtained from a private cohort and split into two independent datasets: **DT rain** and **DT est**. The paper specifies that DT rain contains 2319 abdominal portal CT scans from six medical centers, while DT est contains 1094 scans from three medical centers. This is a clear indication of the datasets used in their study.

I will also check the **methodology section** for any additional details about the datasets, such as how they were collected or any preprocessing steps. The authors mention that reference labels regarding early markers were obtained based on assessments by a pool of radiologists, which adds context to the dataset's reliability.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are derived from a private cohort and not publicly available, there may not be formal citations for them. Instead, I will note that the datasets are proprietary and provide a description of their contents.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant details, while also noting that they are not publicly cited.

1. **Dataset Name**: DT rain
   - **Description**: Contains 2319 abdominal portal CT scans from six independent medical centers, used for training.
   
2. **Dataset Name**: DT est
   - **Description**: Contains 1094 abdominal portal CT scans from three independent medical centers, used for testing.

Since these datasets are not publicly available, I will indicate that they are proprietary and provide the context in which they were used.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
