To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MissDiff: Training Diffusion Models on Tabular Data with Missing Values" by Yidong Ouyang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method is evaluated on multiple tabular datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their numerical evaluations. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **Bayesian Network Dataset**: This dataset is generated from a Bayesian Network with specific characteristics, including the number of training and testing samples, as well as the types of variables involved.

2. **Census Dataset**: The authors refer to the Census income dataset, which is a well-known dataset used for classification tasks. They provide a citation for this dataset, which is crucial for proper referencing.

3. **MIMIC4ED Dataset**: This dataset is derived from electronic health records and is used for regression tasks. The authors also provide a citation for this dataset.

I will ensure to extract the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **Census Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker. *Census income data set*. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income, 1996.

- For the **MIMIC4ED Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Feng Xie et al. *Benchmarking emergency department prediction models with machine learning and public electronic health records*. Scientific Data, 9, 2022.

The Bayesian Network dataset does not have a specific citation as it is generated for the purpose of the experiments in this study.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
