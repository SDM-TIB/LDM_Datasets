To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Visual-LiDAR Odometry and Mapping with Monocular Scale Correction and Visual Bootstrapping" by Hanyu Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on the **KITTI Odometry** and **S3E datasets**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the evaluation of their proposed method.

Next, I will look into **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors provide more detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they confirm that the experiments were conducted on the **KITTI Odometry** dataset and the **S3E dataset**. I will take note of any specific details provided about these datasets, such as their characteristics or the context in which they were used.

In the **References section**, I will search for the full citations of the datasets mentioned. The authors likely reference the original papers or sources where these datasets were introduced or described. 

For the **KITTI Odometry dataset**, the citation is:
> A. Geiger, P. Lenz, and R. Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In 2012 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3354–3361, 2012.

For the **S3E dataset**, the citation is:
> N. Ou, H. Cai, J. Yang, and J. Wang. *Targetless extrinsic calibration of camera and low-resolution 3-D LiDAR*. IEEE Sensors Journal, vol. 23, no. 10, pp. 10 889–10 899, 2023.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly describes each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included for proper attribution.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured and formatted correctly.
