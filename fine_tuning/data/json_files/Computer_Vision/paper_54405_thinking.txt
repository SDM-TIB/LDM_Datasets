To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph-Time Convolutional Neural Networks: Architecture and Theoretical Analysis" by Mohammad Sabbaqi and Elvin Isufi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors discuss their numerical results and comparisons with state-of-the-art solutions, which typically involve specific datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using datasets for their experiments, particularly in the **numerical results section**. They refer to benchmark datasets for tasks such as traffic forecasting and weather forecasting. 

1. **METR-LA Dataset**: This dataset contains four months of recorded traffic data over 207 nodes on the highways of Los Angeles County with a 5-minute resolution. It is used for traffic forecasting tasks.

2. **PEMS-BAY Dataset**: This dataset includes six months of traffic information over 325 nodes in the Bay Area, also with a 5-minute resolution. It is similarly used for traffic forecasting.

3. **Molene Dataset**: This dataset contains hourly temperature measurements across 32 stations in a region of France, used for weather forecasting.

4. **NOAA Dataset**: This dataset consists of hourly temperature measurements across 109 stations in the U.S., also used for weather forecasting.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and should include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

- For the **METR-LA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. Li, R. Yu, C. Shahabi, and Y. Liu. "Diffusion convolutional recurrent neural network: Data-driven traffic forecasting." *arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.01926*, 2017.

- For the **PEMS-BAY Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. Li, R. Yu, C. Shahabi, and Y. Liu. "Diffusion convolutional recurrent neural network: Data-driven traffic forecasting." *arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.01926*, 2017.

- For the **Molene Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Khodayar and J. Wang. "Spatio-temporal graph deep neural network for short-term wind speed forecasting." *IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy*, vol. 10, no. 2, pp. 670â€“681, 2018.

- For the **NOAA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > NOAA. "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration." [Online]. Available: https://www.noaa.gov/

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
