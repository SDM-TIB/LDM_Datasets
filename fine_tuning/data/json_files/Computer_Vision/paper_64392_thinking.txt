To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Intestine 3D Shape Refinement Using Point Diffusion Models for Digital Phantom Generation" by Kaouther Mouheb et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may hint at the datasets used. The introduction will likely elaborate on the context and significance of the datasets, while the methods section will detail how the datasets were utilized in the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of segmenting the large intestine and the need for accurate 3D modeling, which suggests that datasets are crucial for their experiments. I will pay close attention to any specific dataset names mentioned.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsection titled "Dataset." Here, the authors explicitly describe the datasets they created and used. They mention three datasets:

1. **TotalSegmentator Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1024 CT scans with reference masks for the large intestine. The authors detail the selection criteria for cases with complete large intestines, ultimately resulting in 308 usable cases.

2. **Duke PET/CT Dataset**: This dataset includes 112 diagnostic-quality CT volumes from PET/CT scans performed at Duke Health. The authors describe the processing steps taken to refine the segmentation results, leading to 75 remaining cases.

3. **Duke CAP Dataset**: This dataset comprises 269 Chest Abdomen Pelvis CT scans from Duke Health patients. The authors mention that a physician refined 34 cases with incorrect masks, resulting in a total of 195 cases.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **TotalSegmentator Dataset**: 
  > Wasserthal, J., Meyer, M., Breit, H.-C., Cyriac, J., Yang, S., & Segeroth, M. (2022). TotalSegmentator: Robust segmentation of 104 anatomical structures in CT images. arXiv preprint arXiv:2208.05868.

- **Duke PET/CT Dataset**: 
  > This dataset is not explicitly cited in the references, but it is derived from diagnostic-quality CT volumes performed at Duke Health.

- **Duke CAP Dataset**: 
  > Similar to the PET/CT dataset, this dataset is based on CT scans from Duke Health patients and does not have a specific citation in the references.

Now, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant information regarding the datasets used in this research paper.
