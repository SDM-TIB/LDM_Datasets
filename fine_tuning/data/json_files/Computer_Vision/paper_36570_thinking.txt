To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalizing the Convolution Operator in Convolutional Neural Networks" by Kamaledin Ghiasi-Shirazi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on the **MNIST dataset**, which is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition. This indicates that I should look for more details about this dataset in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 5) where the author discusses the experimental setup. In section 5.1, the author explicitly states that the experiments were conducted on the **MNIST dataset**, which consists of 60,000 training samples and 10,000 testing samples of handwritten digits. This confirms the dataset's relevance and usage in the experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Since the paper primarily focuses on the MNIST dataset for its experiments, I will note this as the only dataset mentioned.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MNIST dataset as required. This will provide a clear and concise summary of the dataset used in the research paper.
