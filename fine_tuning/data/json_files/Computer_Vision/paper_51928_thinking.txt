To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "CAESR: Conditional Autoencoder and Super-Resolution for Learned Spatial Scalability" by Charles Bonnineau et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors discuss a hybrid learning-based coding approach but do not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section**. In section III (Experimental Results), the authors state that they trained their model using three different image datasets: **DIV2K**, **Flickr2K**, and the training dataset provided by the challenge on learned image compression (CLIC21). This is a clear indication that these datasets are relevant to their experiments.

I will then look for more details about these datasets in the text. The authors mention that the performance is evaluated on the **CLIC21 validation dataset**, which consists of 42 images with various spatial characteristics. This dataset is used for validation purposes, while the other datasets are used for training.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **DIV2K**: The citation is:
   > E. Agustsson and R. Timofte, “Ntire 2017 challenge on single image super-resolution: Dataset and study,” in Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, 2017, pp. 126–135.

2. **Flickr2K**: This dataset is commonly referenced in the context of image super-resolution but does not have a specific citation in the provided text. I will note that it is widely recognized in the community.

3. **CLIC21 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > C. on Learned Image Compression, “https://www.compression.cc/,” June 2021.

Having gathered this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
