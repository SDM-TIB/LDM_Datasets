To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Latent Diffusion Model for DNA Sequence Generation" by Zehui Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors have created a **cross-species dataset of 150K unique promoter-gene sequences from 15 species**, which is a strong indication that a dataset is present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the importance of deep generative models in synthetic DNA sequence generation. They mention the dataset again, reinforcing its significance in their research.

In the **data construction and representation section (4.1)**, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they curated. They state that they created a dataset from the **European Promoter Database (EPDnew)**, which contains 160K unique sequences, but they specifically mention using a subset of 150K unique promoter-gene sequences across 15 species. This section will be crucial for extracting specific details about the dataset.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the EPDnew dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **European Promoter Database (EPDnew)**, the citation is:
  > René Dreos, Giovanna Ambrosini, Rouayda Cavin Périer, and Philipp Bucher. *The eukaryotic promoter database: expansion of epdnew and new promoter analysis tools*. Nucleic acids research, 43(D1):D92–D96, 2015.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Cross-Species Dataset of Promoter-Gene Sequences**: This dataset contains 150K unique promoter-gene sequences from 15 different species, which is essential for the authors' generative modeling efforts in genomics.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation as required. This will prepare the information for any further processing or review.
