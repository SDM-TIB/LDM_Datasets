To extract datasets from the research paper titled "To Share or Not to Share: An Extensive Appraisal of Weight-Sharing" by AloÃ¯s Pourchot, Alexis Ducarouge, and Olivier Sigaud, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions leveraging the **NASBENCH-101 dataset** to investigate the impact of weight-sharing on neural architecture search (NAS). This indicates that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will look specifically in **section 3 (Background)**, where the authors describe the **NASBENCH-101 dataset** in detail. They mention that this dataset contains evaluations of 423,000 unique architectures trained on CIFAR-10, along with their training time, training accuracy, validation accuracy, and test accuracy. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's purpose and structure.

In the **References section**, I will locate the full citation for the NASBENCH-101 dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Ying, C., Klein, A., Real, E., Christiansen, E., Murphy, K., & Hutter, F. (2019). *NAS-Bench-101: Towards Reproducible Neural Architecture Search*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.09635.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset. The dataset entry will include the name, description, and citation.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
