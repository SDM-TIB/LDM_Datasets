To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Music Generation Using an LSTM" by Michael Conner et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to focus on sections that are likely to contain specific dataset information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the historical context of music generation and mention using a base open-source model for their work. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets here.

Next, I will examine **section 2.3 (I/O)**, where the authors describe the input data used for training their model. They mention that the songs in their dataset are a mix of classical music and video game soundtracks, specifically in MIDI file format. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name or citation.

Moving on to **section 3 (Experiments)**, the authors discuss their methodology and the various models they created, but again, they do not specify any particular datasets. They refer to the data as a mix of classical music and video game soundtracks but do not provide a formal dataset name.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any named datasets or provide citations for them, I will need to look at the **References section** to see if any of the cited works might refer to datasets that could be relevant to their study. 

In the references, I notice a citation for Sigurður Skúli's article titled "How to Generate Music using a LSTM Neural Network in Keras." This article may contain information about the dataset used in that work, which could be relevant to the current paper. 

I will check the citation for Sigurður Skúli's article to see if it mentions a specific dataset. The citation is:
> Sigurður Skúli. “Music Generation Using a LSTM Neural Network in Keras.” https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-generate-music-using-a-lstm-neural-network-in-keras-68786834d4c5 (2017).

Since the current paper does not provide specific dataset names or citations, I will note that the authors utilized a mix of classical music and video game soundtracks in MIDI format, but I cannot provide a formal dataset citation as none is explicitly mentioned in the paper.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings, noting that while the paper discusses the use of music data in general, it does not provide specific dataset names or citations. I will document the relevant information about the types of music used and the reference to Sigurður Skúli's article for potential dataset insights.
