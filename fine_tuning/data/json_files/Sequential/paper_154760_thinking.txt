To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Intrusion Detection System in Smart Home Network Using Bidirectional LSTM and Convolutional Neural Networks Hybrid Model" by Nelly Elsayed et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the introduction and methodology sections are likely to contain more specific information about the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of intrusion detection in smart home networks, but they do not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the **methodology section** where they describe the implementation of their model.

In **section IV (Empirical Results and Analysis)**, the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for training and testing their model. They refer to it as the **IoT Intrusion Dataset**, which is available on IEEE DataPort. They provide details about the dataset, including that it consists of 42 raw network packet files (pcap) captured from IoT devices like SKT NUGU and EZVIZ Wi-Fi camera.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the IoT Intrusion Dataset. The authors reference it as [26], which corresponds to the following citation:

> H. Kang, D. H. Ahn, G. M. Lee, J. D. Yoo, K. H. Park, and H. K. Kim. *IoT Intrusion Dataset*. IEEE DataPort, 2019.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **IoT Intrusion Dataset**: This dataset consists of 42 raw network packet files (pcap) captured from IoT devices, specifically the SKT NUGU and EZVIZ Wi-Fi camera.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> H. Kang, D. H. Ahn, G. M. Lee, J. D. Yoo, K. H. Park, and H. K. Kim. *IoT Intrusion Dataset*. IEEE DataPort, 2019.

With this information, I am ready to proceed with creating the dataset entry as needed.
