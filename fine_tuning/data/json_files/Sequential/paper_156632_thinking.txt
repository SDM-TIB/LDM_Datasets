To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Short-term wind speed forecasting model based on an attention-gated recurrent neural network and error correction strategy" by Haojian Huang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the model's performance on data from three wind farm sites, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the author mentions three wind farm sites: **Woodburn**, **St. Thomas Island**, and **Santa Cruz Island**. I will check if there are specific details about the datasets used for these sites, such as the number of samples, training/testing splits, and any statistical characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, I will find a table (Table 1) that summarizes the characteristics of the datasets, including the number of samples for each site and their statistical indicators (mean, standard deviation, max, min). This table provides crucial information about the datasets used in the study.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset:

1. **Woodburn Dataset**: 
   - Total Samples: 3251
   - Training Set: 2851
   - Testing Set: 400
   - Mean Wind Speed: 8.3631 m/s
   - Standard Deviation: 3.5523 m/s
   - Max Wind Speed: 19.9028 m/s
   - Min Wind Speed: 0.3115 m/s

2. **St. Thomas Island Dataset**: 
   - Total Samples: 2655
   - Training Set: 2255
   - Testing Set: 400
   - Mean Wind Speed: 7.5884 m/s
   - Standard Deviation: 2.2393 m/s
   - Max Wind Speed: 15.2390 m/s
   - Min Wind Speed: 0.4930 m/s

3. **Santa Cruz Island Dataset**: 
   - Total Samples: 2950
   - Training Set: 2550
   - Testing Set: 400
   - Mean Wind Speed: 7.1710 m/s
   - Standard Deviation: 2.1628 m/s
   - Max Wind Speed: 14.4446 m/s
   - Min Wind Speed: 0.0000 m/s

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works that may have been referenced. However, in this case, the datasets are derived from the author's own experiments and do not have external citations.

Finally, I will ensure that I have all the necessary details to create a structured output for each dataset, including the full citation of the paper itself for context.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Huang, H. (2023). Short-term wind speed forecasting model based on an attention-gated recurrent neural network and error correction strategy. *Journal of xxx*.

Now, I will prepare to format this information into the required structure for further processing.
