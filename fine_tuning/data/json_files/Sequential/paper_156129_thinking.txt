To extract datasets from the research paper titled "T5-SR: A Unified Seq-to-Seq Decoding Strategy for Semantic Parsing" by Yuntao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art results on the **Spider dataset**, indicating that this dataset is likely to be a key focus of the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any additional context or datasets. The authors discuss the challenges of text-to-SQL parsing and reference the **Spider dataset** again, confirming its significance in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets used for evaluation. The authors state that they conducted experiments on the **Spider dataset** and also mention the **Spider-Syn dataset**, which is a variant designed to test robustness against lexicon schema linking issues. This indicates that both datasets are crucial for their evaluation.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Spider dataset**, the citation is:
   > Tao Yu, Rui Zhang, Kai Yang, Michihiro Yasunaga, Dongxu Wang, Zifan Li, James Ma, Irene Li, Qingning Yao, Shanelle Roman, Zilin Zhang, and Dragomir Radev. *Spider: A large-scale human-labeled dataset for complex and cross-domain semantic parsing and text-to-SQL task*. In Proceedings of the EMNLP, 2018.

2. For the **Spider-Syn dataset**, the citation is:
   > Yujian Gan, Xinyun Chen, Qiuping Huang, Matthew Purver, John R. Woodward, Jinxia Xie, and Pengsheng Huang. *Towards robustness of text-to-SQL models against synonym substitution*. In Proceedings of the ACL, 2021.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **Spider dataset**: A large-scale human-labeled dataset for complex and cross-domain semantic parsing and text-to-SQL tasks.
- **Spider-Syn dataset**: A variant of the Spider dataset designed to test the robustness of text-to-SQL models against synonym substitutions.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately documented for future reference or processing.
