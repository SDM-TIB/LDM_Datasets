To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improved Method of Stock Trading under Reinforcement Learningâ€”Based on DRQN and Sentiment Indicators ARBR" by Peng Zhou and Jingling Tang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the application of a DRQN-ARBR model in stock trading, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Example analysis)**, where the authors describe their experimental data. They state that the experimental data comes from **China Securities Net and Tushare big data community**, specifically mentioning the selection of one-minute high-frequency stock data of **Tapai Group (002233)** from January 2017 to July 2021. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used.

In this section, the authors detail their data preprocessing methods, including grouping the data into 30-minute intervals and calculating logarithmic returns. This information is crucial for understanding how the dataset was structured and utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the dataset is derived from a specific source (China Securities Net and Tushare), I will need to provide a citation for these sources as they are not traditional datasets with formal citations.

The citation for the dataset can be structured as follows:
- **Tapai Group (002233) Stock Data**: 
  > China Securities Net. *Tapai Group (002233) Stock Data*. Retrieved from [Tushare](https://tushare.pro).

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset, I will create a citation based on the information available.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the information is clear and accessible for future reference or analysis.
