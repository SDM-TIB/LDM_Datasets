To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differentiable, learnable, regionalized process-based models with multiphysical outputs can approach state-of-the-art hydrologic prediction accuracy" by Dapeng Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **Daymet forcing dataset** and compares it to LSTM performance, indicating that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, specifically **section 2.4 (Input and observation datasets)**, where the authors detail the datasets used in their study. Here, they explicitly mention the following datasets:

1. **CAMELS Dataset**: This dataset contains meteorological forcings, streamflow observations, and attributes for 671 basins in the contiguous United States. The authors reference the original source of this dataset.

2. **NLDAS Dataset**: The North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) provides meteorological forcing data used in their experiments.

3. **MOD16-MT Dataset**: This dataset is used for estimating terrestrial surface evapotranspiration and is based on satellite data.

In the **References section**, I will look for the full citations of these datasets to ensure proper attribution:

- For the **CAMELS Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **NLDAS Dataset**, the citation is:

(2012). Continental-scale water and energy flux analysis and validation for the North American Land Data Assimilation System project phase 2 (NLDAS-2): 1. Intercomparison and application of model products. Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, 117(D3). https://doi.org/10.1029/2011JD016048

- For the **MOD16-MT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mu, Q., Zhao, M., & Running, S. W. (2011). Improvements to a MODIS global terrestrial evapotranspiration algorithm. Remote Sensing of Environment, 115(8), 1781â€“1800. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2011.02.015

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
