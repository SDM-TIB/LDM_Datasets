To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Deep Learning by Inverse Square Root Linear Units (ISRLUs)" by Brad Carlile et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions experiments conducted with TensorFlow on the MNIST dataset, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their experiments using the MNIST dataset, which consists of gray images in 10 classes with 60,000 training and 10,000 test images. This is a clear identification of a dataset used in their research.

I will also check the **conclusion and references sections** to ensure that there are no additional datasets mentioned and to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, and its citation is as follows:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. URL: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the ISRLU activation function and its performance, it appears that the MNIST dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MNIST dataset as required. This will allow for easy reference and verification in future work or discussions.
