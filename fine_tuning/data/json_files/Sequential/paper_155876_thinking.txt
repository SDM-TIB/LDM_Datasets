To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed LSTM-Learning from Differentially Private Label Proportions" by Timon Sachweh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their models using two popular datasets, **Pems-Bay** and **METR-LA**, and also mention a new dataset based on the Luxembourg SUMO Traffic (LuST) scenario. This gives me a clear starting point.

Next, I will look into the **datasets section** (Section IV) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they describe:

1. **Pems-Bay**: This dataset was collected by the California Transportation Agencies (CalTrans) and contains data from 325 sensors in the Bay Area, collected in 5-minute intervals from January 1st, 2017, to May 31st, 2017. The dataset includes traffic density and normalized time values.

2. **METR-LA**: Similar to Pems-Bay, this dataset consists of traffic density data collected from 207 sensors in Los Angeles County from March 1st, 2012, to June 30th, 2012.

3. **LuST**: This is a new dataset created from the Luxembourg SUMO Traffic scenario, which simulates traffic counts and speeds for every 5 minutes over a day. The authors provide a link for downloading the dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Pems-Bay**, the citation is:
  > Y. Li, R. Yu, C. Shahabi, and Y. Liu. "Diffusion convolutional recurrent neural network: Data-driven traffic forecasting." In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR ’18), 2018.

- For **METR-LA**, the citation is:
  > H. V. Jagadish, J. Gehrke, A. Labrinidis, Y. Papakonstantinou, J. M. Patel, R. Ramakrishnan, and C. Shahabi. "Big data and its technical challenges." Communications of the ACM, vol. 57, no. 7, pp. 86–94, 2014.

- For **LuST**, the citation is:
  > L. Codecá, R. Frank, S. Faye, and T. Engel. "Luxembourg SUMO Traffic (LuST) Scenario: Traffic Demand Evaluation." IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine, vol. 9, no. 2, pp. 52–63, 2017.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
