To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comprehensive Study of Deep Bidirectional LSTM RNNs for Acoustic Modeling in Speech Recognition" by Albert Zeyer et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the experimental analysis was performed on the **Quaero task** and includes results on **Switchboard**, indicating that these may be datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Comparisons and Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They explicitly state that they used a subset of **50 hours from the Quaero Broadcast Conversational English Speech database** for training, and the **Hub5’00 evaluation data** for testing. This gives me the names of two datasets used in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **Quaero Broadcast Conversational English Speech database**: This dataset is mentioned as being used for training, but I need to find the full citation. The authors refer to it in the context of their experiments, but I will need to look for the original source or documentation for this dataset.

2. **Hub5’00 evaluation data**: Similarly, I will look for the citation for this dataset. The authors mention it in the context of their evaluation, so I will need to find the original reference.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format. The full citations for the datasets are crucial, so I will ensure to include them accurately.

Now, I will summarize the datasets:

- For the **Quaero Broadcast Conversational English Speech database**, I will look for the citation, which may be found in the references or through a quick search for the dataset documentation.

- For the **Hub5’00 evaluation data**, I will also search for its citation in the references or through external sources.

Once I have gathered all necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
