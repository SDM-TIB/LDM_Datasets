To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Country-Scale Cropland Mapping in Data-Scarce Settings Using Deep Learning: A Case Study of Nigeria" by Joaquin Gajardo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The authors discuss using a global cropland dataset and a hand-labeled dataset for training machine learning models, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details. Here, the authors mention the challenges of obtaining ground-truth data and the use of existing geo-referenced data, which suggests that they will provide specific dataset names later in the paper.

I will then focus on the **Data section**, particularly **subsection 2.2 (Cropland labels)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. They mention two main datasets:

1. **Geowiki Dataset**: This dataset consists of crowd-sourced points of cropland and non-cropland sampled globally. The authors provide specific subsets:
   - **Geowiki World**: Contains 24,761 samples, with 13,980 labeled as cropland.
   - **Geowiki Nigeria**: Contains 452 samples, with 312 labeled as cropland.
   - **Geowiki Neighbours**: Includes samples from Nigeria and neighboring countries, totaling 790 samples.

2. **Nigeria Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,827 manually labeled points within Nigeria, split into training, validation, and test sets.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The Geowiki dataset is cited as follows:
- For the Geowiki dataset:
  > Laso Bayas, J. C., Lesiv, M., Waldner, F., et al. (2017). A global reference database of crowdsourced cropland data collected using the Geo-Wiki platform. *Scientific Data*, 4(1), 170136.

The Nigeria dataset does not have a specific citation since it is a new dataset created by the authors, but I will note that it is based on high-resolution satellite imagery.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the Geowiki dataset and a description of the Nigeria dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or analysis.
