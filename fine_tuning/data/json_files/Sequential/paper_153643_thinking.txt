To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A hybrid model based on deep LSTM for predicting high-dimensional chaotic systems" by Youming Lei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and results sections** where the authors typically describe the experiments conducted and the datasets utilized. In this paper, the authors mention two specific chaotic systems: the **Mackey-Glass (MG) system** and the **Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) system**. I will look for detailed descriptions of how these datasets were generated or used in the experiments.

In the **results section**, the authors provide specific details about the datasets, including the parameters used for the MG and KS systems. For the MG system, they mention that the data was generated using a second-order Runge-Kutta algorithm with specific parameters, and for the KS system, they describe the discretization method and the parameters involved.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets. The citations are typically found in the references section of the paper. For the datasets mentioned:

1. **Mackey-Glass System**: The citation for the original Mackey-Glass model is:
   > Mackey, M. C., & Glass, G. E. (1977). *Oscillation and chaos in physiological control systems*. Science, 197(4300), 287-289.

2. **Kuramoto-Sivashinsky System**: The citation for the original Kuramoto-Sivashinsky model is:
   > Kuramoto, Y. (1976). *Persistent propagation of concentration waves in dissipative media far from thermal equilibrium*. Progress of Theoretical Physics, 55(3), 356-369.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
