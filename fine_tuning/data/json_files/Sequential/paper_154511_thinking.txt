To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ICodeNet - A Hierarchical Neural Network Approach for Source Code Author Identification" by Pranali Bora et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention the dataset used for the experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the problem being addressed and may reference specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Approach)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of raw source code Java files taken from GitHub repositories of various authors. They specify that the original dataset included source code archives for 40 different authors, but after filtering, the final dataset consisted of Java files for 20 authors.

In this section, the authors also discuss the characteristics of the dataset, such as its imbalance and the removal of authors with fewer than 50 files. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and its suitability for the research.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors mention that the dataset is publicly shared to enable further research, but they do not provide a specific citation for it in the text. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is derived from GitHub repositories, which is a common source for such datasets, but I will not have a formal citation for it.

Since the dataset is not attributed to a specific paper or publication, I will summarize it as follows:

1. **Source Code Author Identification Dataset**: This dataset consists of raw source code Java files from GitHub repositories, originally containing files from 40 authors, but filtered down to 20 authors with sufficient data. The dataset is publicly available for research purposes.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly state the dataset's name, description, and any relevant details, even if a formal citation is not available.

In conclusion, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
