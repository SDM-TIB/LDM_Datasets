To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Discriminative Prototypes with Dynamic Time Warping" by Xiaobin Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method, DP-DTW, shows superior performance on time series classification benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention two specific datasets:

1. **UCR Time Series Archive**: This dataset is a benchmark collection of 128 univariate time series datasets with various application backgrounds, such as electronics and biology. Each dataset has multiple classes, and each sequence belongs to one class.

2. **Breakfast Dataset**: This dataset contains 1,712 videos of 48 actions related to breakfast preparation, recorded from multiple views in real-life scenarios.

3. **Hollywood Extended Dataset**: This dataset comprises 16 action classes and 937 videos clipped from Hollywood movies, with an average of 2.5 actions per video.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **UCR Time Series Archive**, the citation is:
  > Hoang Anh Dau, Anthony Bagnall, Kaveh Kamgar, Chin-Chia Michael Yeh, Yan Zhu, Shaghayegh Gharghabi, Chotirat Annh Ratanamahatana, and Eamonn Keogh. *The UCR Time Series Archive*. IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica, 6(6):1293–1305, 2019.

- For the **Breakfast Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hilde Kuehne, Ali Arslan, and Thomas Serre. *The Language of Actions: Recovering the Syntax and Semantics of Goal-Directed Human Activities*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 780–787, 2014.

- For the **Hollywood Extended Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Piotr Bojanowski, Rémi Lajugie, Francis Bach, Ivan Laptev, Jean Ponce, Cordelia Schmid, and Josef Sivic. *Weakly Supervised Action Labeling in Videos under Ordering Constraints*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 628–643. Springer, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
