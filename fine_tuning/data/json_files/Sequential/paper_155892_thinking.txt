To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluation of the syllables pronunciation quality in speech rehabilitation through the solution of the classification problem" by Evgeny Kostyuchenko, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on classifying syllables before and after surgical treatment, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Method for solving the classification problem and description of the input data)**, particularly **subsection 4.2 (Input data and preparation)**, where the author describes the datasets used in the study. Here, the author mentions that two datasets were obtained:

1. **Dataset for 100 syllables**: This dataset contains recordings from 22 sessions across 8 users (7 men and 1 woman), totaling 2,200 entries. It is based on syllables selected from the GOST 50840-95 table.

2. **Dataset for 90 syllables**: This dataset includes recordings from 85 sessions across 32 users (21 men and 11 women), totaling 8,500 records. It focuses on phonemes that are most susceptible to change.

The author also notes that the first two sessions of each user are used for model training, while the remaining sessions are reserved for validation.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section**. The GOST 50840-95 standard is cited as follows:

- **GOST R 50840-95**: Standard GOST R 50840-95 Voice over paths of communication. Methods for assessing the quality, legibility and recognition. Publishing Standards, Moscow. 234 p. (1995).

Since the datasets are derived from the GOST standard, I will use this citation for the dataset of 100 syllables. The dataset for 90 syllables does not have a specific citation provided in the paper, but it is based on the phonemes identified as problematic, which may not have a formal citation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations:

1. **Dataset for 100 syllables**: Contains 2,200 entries from 22 recording sessions of 8 users, based on the GOST 50840-95 standard.
   - Citation: GOST R 50840-95. Standard GOST R 50840-95 Voice over paths of communication. Methods for assessing the quality, legibility and recognition. Publishing Standards, Moscow. 234 p. (1995).

2. **Dataset for 90 syllables**: Contains 8,500 entries from 85 recording sessions of 32 users, focusing on problematic phonemes.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that the citations are correctly formatted and included for each dataset.
