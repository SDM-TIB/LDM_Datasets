To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "ConvBoost: Boosting ConvNets for Sensor-based Activity Recognition" by Shuai Shao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluated their method on three standard benchmarks, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Opportunity (OPP)**: This dataset is described as one of the most challenging wearable-based HAR datasets, containing 18 daily kitchen activities collected from five runs of four subjects at a sampling rate of 30 Hz.

2. **Physical Activity Monitoring (PAMAP2)**: This dataset includes 12 daily activities collected from nine subjects, featuring IMU recordings from various body locations.

3. **Growing Old Together Validation (GOTOV)**: This dataset consists of activities collected from older-age subjects, with 16 daily activities recorded from thirty-five participants.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Opportunity dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ricardo Chavarriaga, Hesam Sagha, Alberto Calatroni, Sundara Tejaswi Digumarti, Gerhard Tröster, José del R Millán, and Daniel Roggen. *The Opportunity challenge: A benchmark database for on-body sensor-based activity recognition*. Pattern Recognition Letters, 34(15), 2033–2042, 2013.

- For the **PAMAP2 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Attila Reiss and Didier Stricker. *Introducing a new benchmarked dataset for activity monitoring*. In 2012 16th International Symposium on Wearable Computers, 108–109, 2012.

- For the **GOTOV dataset**, the citation is:
  > Stylianos Paraschiakos, Ricardo Cachucho, Matthijs Moed, Diana van Heemst, Simon Mooijaart, Eline P Slagboom, Arno Knobbe, and Marian Beekman. *Activity recognition using wearable sensors for tracking the elderly*. User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 30(3), 567–605, 2020.

Now that I have the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
