To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Entity-Aware Language Model as an Unsupervised Reranker" by Mohammad Sadegh Rasooli and Sarangarajan Parthasarathy, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of training a reranker without annotated data and mentions experiments in the music domain, which suggests that there may be datasets related to music queries.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, the authors describe their training and testing data. They mention using a **heldout dataset** consisting of 3,941 transcribed queries from a mobile phone application and a **blind test set** with 4,970 sentences collected from a distant microphone. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

I will also look for any specific datasets or sources mentioned in the **data assumption section (3.1)**. Here, the authors refer to a **knowledge-base** that consists of music information, including artist names, song titles, and usage frequency. However, this knowledge-base is not a dataset in the traditional sense but rather a resource used to enhance their model.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Heldout Dataset**: The citation for the heldout dataset is not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is derived from a mobile phone application. Therefore, I will note it as:
   > Heldout dataset: Transcribed queries from a mobile phone application (3941 sentences).

2. **Blind Test Set**: Similarly, the blind test set is also not cited in a formal manner, but it is described as:
   > Blind test set: Queries collected from a distant microphone (4970 sentences).

3. **Knowledge-base**: The knowledge-base is referenced but does not have a formal citation. It is described as:
   > Knowledge-base: A database consisting of music information with 13 million entries.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the essence of the datasets used in the experiments, even if they do not have formal citations like traditional datasets.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
