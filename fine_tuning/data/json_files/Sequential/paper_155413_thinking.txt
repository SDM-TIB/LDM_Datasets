To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accurate Discharge Coefficient Prediction of Streamlined Weirs by Coupling Linear Regression and Deep Convolutional Gated Recurrent Unit" by Weibin Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses an "experimental dataset" for 120 models of streamlined weirs, which suggests that a specific dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data description)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They mention that the dataset consists of 120 models designed based on the Joukowsky transform function, and it includes various hydraulic parameters. This section is crucial as it provides the necessary details about the dataset used in the study.

In this section, the authors describe the dataset as being divided into two groups: models with and without a base-block. They also list nine input parameters that are considered in the study, which further confirms the dataset's relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference a previous work by Bagheri & Kabiri-Samani (2020a) that is related to the dataset. I will extract the full citation for this reference:

- For the dataset based on the Joukowsky transform function, the citation is:
  > Bagheri, S., & Kabiri-Samani, A. (2020a). Overflow characteristics of streamlined weirs based on model experimentation. Flow Measurement and Instrumentation, 101720.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extracted from the paper:

1. **Experimental Dataset for Streamlined Weirs**: This dataset includes 120 models designed based on the Joukowsky transform function, with various hydraulic parameters affecting the discharge coefficient.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
