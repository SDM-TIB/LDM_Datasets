To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Drowsiness Detection Based On Driver Temporal Behavior Using a New Developed Dataset" by F. Faraji et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors developed their own dataset for training a CNN and an LSTM, which suggests that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Our Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they created. They describe it as having two parts: 

1. **Part 1**: A collection of labeled images for training the CNN, which includes 28 videos recorded under various conditions, resulting in 1,042 images. The images are manually labeled with annotations for facial features such as eyes and mouth.

2. **Part 2**: A time series dataset for training the LSTM network, which consists of eye closure and yawning durations saved as two-dimensional time series data.

The authors also mention that they augmented their dataset with the DDD dataset and the YawDD dataset, which are relevant to their work.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **DDD dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Abtahi, M. Omidyeganeh, S. Shirmohammadi, and B. Hariri. *YawDD: A Yawning Detection Dataset*. In Proceedings of the 5th ACM Multimedia Systems Conference, pages 24–28, 2014.

- For the **YawDD dataset**, the citation is:
  > C.-H. Weng, Y.-H. Lai, and S.-H. Lai. *Driver Drowsiness Detection via a Hierarchical Temporal Deep Belief Network*. In Asian Conference on Computer Vision, pages 117–133, 2016.

Next, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Custom Dataset for Drowsiness Detection**: This dataset includes labeled images and time series data specifically created for the study. It is not formally cited in the references, as it is the authors' own dataset.

2. **DDD Dataset**: A dataset used for augmenting the authors' dataset, focused on yawning detection.

3. **YawDD Dataset**: Another dataset referenced for its relevance to yawning detection.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation where applicable. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
