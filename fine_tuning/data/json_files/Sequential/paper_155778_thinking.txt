To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Intrusion Detection in Internet of Things using Convolutional Neural Networks" by Martin Kody≈° et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a novel solution for intrusion detection in IoT devices, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the lack of IoT/IIoT datasets and mention the introduction of the **TON IoT Telemetry dataset**. This indicates that this dataset is likely central to their research.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsection titled **A. TON IoT Dataset**. Here, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset, including its creation, structure, and the types of data it contains. They describe the dataset as being composed of telemetry data from various sensors, which is crucial for understanding its application in their experiments.

The authors mention two specific datasets derived from the TON IoT dataset:
1. **Processed IoT dataset (PR dataset)**: This dataset is a processed version of the raw data, formatted into CSV files for easier analysis.
2. **Train Test IoT dataset (TT dataset)**: This dataset is a subset of the PR dataset, specifically designed for training and testing purposes.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that they used both the PR and TT datasets for their experiments, which further validates their importance in the study.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The citation for the **TON IoT Telemetry dataset** is as follows:
- Alsaedi, A., Moustafa, N., Tari, Z., Mahmood, A., & Anwar, A. (2020). *TON IoT telemetry dataset: a new generation dataset of IoT and IIoT for data-driven intrusion detection systems*. IEEE Access, 8, 165130-165150.

Since the authors refer to the PR and TT datasets as derived from the TON IoT dataset, I will cite the original dataset only, as it serves as the authoritative source.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that all information is accurately represented for future reference or processing.
