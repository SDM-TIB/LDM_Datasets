To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatiotemporal Feature Learning Based on Two-Step LSTM and Transformer for CT Scans" by Chih-Chung Hsu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a novel approach for COVID-19 symptom classification using CT scans, which suggests that there may be datasets related to CT scans used in the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of classifying CT scans due to the diversity of imaging data. They reference the **COV19-CT-DB dataset**, which is specifically mentioned as having annotated COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 CT scans. This indicates that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** where the authors provide details about the datasets used. They mention that the **COV19-CT-DB dataset** comprises 1993 training, 484 validation, and 5281 testing CT scans. This confirms that the dataset is utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **COV19-CT-DB dataset**. The relevant citation is:
> Kollias, D., Arsenos, A., Kollias, S. (2022). *AI-MIA: COVID-19 Detection and Severity Analysis through Medical Imaging*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2206.04732.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about the dataset, including its name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that the full citation is included for clarity and proper attribution. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all necessary details about the dataset used in the research.
