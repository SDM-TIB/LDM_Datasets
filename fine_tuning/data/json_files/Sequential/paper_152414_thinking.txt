To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prior Attention for Style-aware Sequence-to-Sequence Models" by Lucas Sterckx et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses extending sequence-to-sequence models and mentions the application to sentence simplification, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In **section 3.1**, they state that they demonstrate their method on a **sentence simplification corpus** called **Wikilarge**. This is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for their work.

In section 3.1, the authors provide details about the **Wikilarge collection**, describing it as a dataset containing 296,402 automatically aligned complex and simple sentences from the ordinary and simple English Wikipedia corpora. They also mention that this dataset has been used extensively in previous work, which reinforces its significance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Wikilarge dataset**. The authors reference the original work that introduced this dataset, which is by Zhu et al. (2010). The citation I need to extract is:

- For **Wikilarge**, the citation is:
  > Zhemin Zhu, Delphine Bernhard, and Iryna Gurevych. *A monolingual tree-based translation model for sentence simplification*. In Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Computational Linguistics (Coling 2010), pages 1353â€“1361, 2010.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as it is critical for proper attribution and referencing.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for **Wikilarge** in the required format, ready for any further processing or review.
