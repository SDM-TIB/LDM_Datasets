To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AdaLoss: A computationally-eï¬ƒcient and provably convergent adaptive gradient method" by Xiaoxia Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for validation or experiments. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the datasets are not named directly, I will note any descriptions that could help identify them later.

In this paper, the authors mention using datasets for numerical experiments in the context of LSTM models for text classification and policy gradients for control problems. I will look for specific names or references to these datasets in the text.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Fake News Dataset" by George McIntire, I will note the following citation:
> McIntire, G. (2017). *Fake news dataset*. Retrieved from https://github.com/GeorgeMcIntire/fake_real_news_dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete for future use or analysis.
