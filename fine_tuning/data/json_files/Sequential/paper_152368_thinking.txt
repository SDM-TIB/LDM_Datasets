To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A C-LSTM Neural Network for Text Classification" by Chunting Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their model on sentiment classification and question classification tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention two datasets:

1. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**: This dataset consists of 11,855 movie reviews, split into training, development, and test sets. The authors specify that the dataset is used for sentiment classification, with a fine-grained classification task involving five labels (very positive, positive, neutral, negative, very negative) and a binary classification task.

2. **TREC Dataset**: This dataset is used for question type classification and contains 5,452 labeled questions for training and 500 questions for testing. The authors describe the categories into which the questions are classified, such as location, human, entity, abbreviation, description, and numeric.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**, the citation is:
  > Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Y Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D Manning, Andrew Y Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of Empirical Methods on Natural Language Processing, volume 1631, page 1642, 2013.

- For the **TREC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xin Li and Dan Roth. *Learning question classifiers*. In Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, pages 1â€“7, 2002.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
