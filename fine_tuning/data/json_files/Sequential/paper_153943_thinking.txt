To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Fidelity Generative Deep Learning Turbulent Flows" by Nicholas Geneva and Nicholas Zabaras, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a "novel multi-fidelity deep generative model" for predicting high-fidelity turbulent flow fields, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets or references to data sources.

Next, I will review the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly focusing on any sections that explicitly discuss datasets. In this paper, the authors describe two numerical examples: turbulent flow over a backwards step and turbulent flow around an array of cylinders. I will look for details about the datasets used in these examples.

In the **numerical examples** section, I will find specific references to the datasets used for training and testing the model. For instance, the authors mention using low-fidelity and high-fidelity simulations generated by OpenFOAM for both examples. I will note the characteristics of these datasets, such as the number of flows, Reynolds numbers, and any specific configurations mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or methodologies referenced in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used.

For example, if the authors refer to a specific dataset or simulation method, I will ensure to include the complete citation as follows:

1. **OpenFOAM Simulations**: The authors used OpenFOAM for generating the low-fidelity and high-fidelity simulations. The citation for OpenFOAM is:
   > H. Jasak, A. Jemcov, Z. Tukovic et al., *OpenFOAM: A C++ library for complex physics simulations*, in International workshop on coupled methods in numerical dynamics, vol. 1000, IUC Dubrovnik, Croatia, 2007, 1–20.

2. **Turbulent Flow over a Backwards Step**: The dataset includes simulations at various Reynolds numbers, with specific configurations mentioned in the paper. The citation for the relevant study could be:
   > E. Erturk, *Numerical solutions of 2-D steady incompressible flow over a backward-facing step*, Computers and Fluids, 37 (2008), 633 – 655.

3. **Turbulent Flow around an Array of Cylinders**: Similar to the previous example, I will note the configurations and Reynolds numbers used, along with any relevant citations.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that all datasets are properly documented and attributed, facilitating further research or validation of the findings presented in the paper.
