To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "An Empirical Study of Cross-Lingual Transferability in Generative Dialogue State Tracker" by Yen-Ting Lin and Yun-Nung Chen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly named or described. The abstract mentions the use of large-scale datasets for dialogue systems, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference the **Ninth Dialog System Technology Challenge (DSTC9)** and mention two datasets: **MultiWOZ 2.1** and **CrossWOZ**. This indicates that these datasets are significant for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **dataset section** where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **MultiWOZ 2.1**: This is described as a task-oriented dataset with over 8,438 dialogues and 113,556 turns, covering 7 domains and 24 slots. It is noted for its updates in dialogue state annotations.

2. **CrossWOZ**: This dataset is a Chinese multi-domain task-oriented dataset with more than 5,000 dialogues, five domains, and 72 slots. The authors mention that it has been translated into English for their experiments, referred to as **CrossWOZ-en**.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they used both **MultiWOZ 2.1** and **CrossWOZ-en** for their evaluations, which reinforces their importance in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MultiWOZ 2.1**, the citation is:
  > Eric, M.; Goel, R.; Paul, S.; Kumar, A.; Sethi, A.; Ku, P.; Goyal, A. K.; Agarwal, S.; Gao, S.; and Hakkani-Tur, D. (2019). *MultiWOZ 2.1: A Consolidated Multi-Domain Dialogue Dataset with State Corrections and State Tracking Baselines*.

- For **CrossWOZ**, the citation is:
  > Gunasekara, C.; Kim, S.; D’Haro, L. F.; Rastogi, A.; Chen, Y.-N.; Eric, M.; Hedayatnia, B.; Gopalakrishnan, K.; Liu, Y.; Huang, C.-W.; Hakkani-Tür, D.; et al. (2020). *Overview of the Ninth Dialog System Technology Challenge: DSTC9*.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included for reference. This will allow for clear documentation of the datasets used in the research.
