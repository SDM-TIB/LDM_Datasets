To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting County Level Corn Yields Using Deep Long Short Term Memory Models" by Zehui Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of county-level corn yield and hourly weather data, indicating that these are key datasets for the study.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or specific dataset names. The introduction emphasizes the importance of corn yield prediction and mentions the USDA's reliance on survey-based data, but does not specify datasets.

Moving on to the **data collection** section, I will focus on subsections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, which detail the datasets used in the study:

1. **Yield Data**: This dataset consists of county-level corn yield data collected for each of Iowa's 99 counties from 1980 to 2016. The authors mention that they downloaded this data from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Quick Stats.

2. **Weather & Soil Data**: The authors purchased hourly weather data from Weather Underground, which is representative of a larger area rather than a single weather station. This dataset includes various weather variables relevant to corn yield prediction.

3. **Soil Quality Data**: Soil quality data was collected from the SSURGO database and aggregated to the county level. The authors selected fourteen variables from this dataset that they deemed most relevant to corn yield.

In the **references section**, I will look for full citations for the datasets mentioned. The key references include:

- For the **NASS Quick Stats** dataset:
  > USDA., NASS Quickstats. Available at http://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/

- For the **Weather Underground** dataset:
  > Weather Underground. Available at https://www.wunderground.com/history/

- For the **SSURGO database**:
  > USDA., SSURGO. Available at https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/survey/geo/?cid=nrcs142p2_053631

Now that I have identified the datasets and their sources, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
