To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Neural Trans-Dimensional Random Field Language Models with Noise-Contrastive Estimation" by Bin Wang and Zhijian Ou, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the training efficiency of neural TRF LMs and mentions a "40x larger training set," which suggests that a specific dataset is used, but I need to find its name.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe two experiments. The first experiment, "short-word morphology," mentions that the training and validation sets include words extracted from the **English Gigaword dataset**. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

In the same section, the authors also mention the **CHiME-4 Challenge data** for the second experiment, which is used to evaluate the performance of the neural TRF LMs. This confirms that both datasets are relevant for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **English Gigaword dataset**, the citation is:
   > "Ldc english gigaword," https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2003T05.

2. For the **CHiME-4 Challenge data**, the citation is:
   > "Chime-4 speech separation and recognition challenge," http://spandh.dcs.shef.ac.uk/chime_challenge/chime2016/index.html.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that I have accurately captured the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations as required.
