To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "View Adaptive Recurrent Neural Networks for High Performance Human Action Recognition from Skeleton Data" by Pengfei Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets, indicating that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiment Results)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **NTU RGB+D Dataset**: This dataset is described as the largest dataset with RGB+D videos and skeleton data for human action recognition, containing 56,880 video samples across 60 action classes. It includes various camera setups, which adds complexity to the dataset.

2. **SBU Kinect Interaction Dataset**: This dataset consists of 282 sequences of interactions between two subjects, categorized into 8 classes. It is designed for subject-independent evaluation with 5-fold cross-validation.

3. **SYSU 3D Human-Object Interaction Set**: This dataset includes 12 actions performed by 40 subjects, totaling 480 sequences. The authors mention two standard evaluation protocols for this dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For the **NTU RGB+D Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **SBU Kinect Interaction Dataset**, the citation is:
  > K. Yun, J. Honorio, D. Chattopadhyay, T. L. Berg, and D. Samaras. *Two-person interaction detection using body-pose features and multiple instance learning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, pages 28–35, 2012.

- For the **SYSU 3D Human-Object Interaction Set**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
