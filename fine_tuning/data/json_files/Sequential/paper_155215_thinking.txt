To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Nonlinear pile-up separation with LSTM neural networks for cryogenic particle detectors" by Felix Wagner, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on an exemplary dataset, which suggests that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods** or **results** sections. In this paper, the author describes a simulated dataset used for training the LSTM model. The details of this dataset are provided in **section 2.1 (Used data)**, where it states that the dataset consists of 60,000 samples, split into training, validation, and test sets.

I will note the following details about the dataset:

1. **Simulated Dataset**: The dataset is generated based on a simulation of realistic recoil events, which is crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper. The paper mentions that the dataset will be made publicly available with the deanonymized version of the work.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. However, since the dataset is simulated and not derived from a previously published source, there may not be a formal citation for it. Instead, I will note that the dataset is based on methods described in previous works, which are cited in the paper.

The relevant references that describe the methods used to create the simulated dataset include:

- For the parametric model of the response function:

- For the simulation of noise traces:
  > M. Carrettoni and O. Cremonesi. "Generation of noise time series with arbitrary power spectrum." *Computer Physics Communications*, 181(12):1982–1985, 2010. doi: 10.1016/j.cpc.2010.09.003.

- For the saturation curve approximation:

Since the dataset is simulated and not a traditional dataset from a public repository, I will summarize it as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Simulated Recoil Events Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset of 60,000 samples generated through simulation, used for training an LSTM model to separate pile-up events in cryogenic particle detectors. The dataset is split into 42,000 training samples, 6,000 validation samples, and 12,000 test samples.
- **Citation**: The dataset is based on methods described in the following references:
  - F. Pröbst et al. (1995)
  - M. Carrettoni and O. Cremonesi (2010)
  - Martin Stahlberg (2020)

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all citations are accurately represented.
