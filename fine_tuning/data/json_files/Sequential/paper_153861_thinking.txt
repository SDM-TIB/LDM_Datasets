To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Influence Paths for Characterizing Subject-Verb Number Agreement in LSTM Language Models" by Kaiji Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the **introduction** where the authors might discuss previous work and datasets used in their experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference prior studies that assess LSTM models' abilities, but they do not specify datasets yet. I will then look into the **methods section**, particularly in **section 4.1 (Dataset and Model)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their number agreement tasks. Here, they mention that they study the number agreement datasets from Lakretz et al. (2019), which are synthetically generated datasets.

The paper specifies that these datasets vary in syntactic structures and the number of nouns between the subject and verb. However, it does not provide specific names for these datasets, so I will need to refer to the cited work by Lakretz et al. (2019) for the exact dataset names and details.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Lakretz et al. (2019) paper, which is crucial for providing proper attribution to the datasets used. The citation is as follows:
> Yair Lakretz, German Kruszewski, Theo Desbordes, Dieuwke Hupkes, Stanislas Dehaene, and Marco Baroni. 2019. The emergence of number and syntax units in LSTM language models. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.07435*.

Since the paper does not provide additional dataset names beyond referencing Lakretz et al., I will conclude that the primary dataset used in this study is derived from their work.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. The dataset entry will reflect the information gathered from the paper and the referenced work.
