To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mimic and Conquer: Heterogeneous Tree Structure Distillation for Syntactic NLP" by Hao Fei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method on various syntax-dependent tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using several datasets for their experiments:

1. **OntoNotes**: This dataset is used for semantic role labeling (SRL) and provides annotations for both dependency and constituency structures. The paper states that it is a well-known resource in the NLP community.

2. **Stanford NLI**: This dataset is utilized for natural language inference (NLI) tasks. It is a large annotated corpus specifically designed for learning natural language inference.

3. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**: This dataset is used for sentiment classification tasks. It contains fine-grained sentiment annotations for sentences.

4. **Semeval-2010 Task 8**: This dataset is used for relation classification tasks. It consists of pairs of nominals and their semantic relations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **OntoNotes**, the citation is:
  > Pradhan, S., Moschitti, A., Xue, N., Ng, H. T., Björkelund, A., Uryupina, O., Zhang, Y., & Zhong, Z. (2013). Towards robust linguistic analysis using OntoNotes. In Proceedings of the CoNLL, pages 143–152.

- For **Stanford NLI**, the citation is:

- For **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**, the citation is:
  > Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J., Chuang, J., Manning, C. D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2013). Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank. In Proceedings of the EMNLP, pages 1631–1642.

- For **Semeval-2010 Task 8**, the citation is:
  > Hendrickx, I., Kim, S. N., Kozareva, Z., Nakov, P., O Séaghdha, D., Pado, S., Pennacchiotti, M., Romano, L., & Szpakowicz, S. (2010). SemEval-2010 task 8: Multi-way classification of semantic relations between pairs of nominals. In Proceedings of SemEval, pages 33–38.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately represented.
