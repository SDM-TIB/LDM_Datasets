To extract datasets from the research paper titled "One-Shot Pruning of Recurrent Neural Networks by Jacobian Spectrum Evaluation" by Matthew Shunshi Zhang and Bradly C. Stadie, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on **sequential MNIST, Billion Words, and Wikitext**, which indicates that these are the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about these datasets. The introduction confirms that the authors are focusing on these three datasets for their evaluations, but I need to gather more specific information about each dataset.

I will then look into the **experiments** section, particularly the subsections that detail the evaluation methods. In the **evaluation** subsection, the authors provide descriptions of the datasets:

1. **Sequential MNIST**: This dataset is a variant of the MNIST dataset where the digits are presented sequentially, requiring the model to learn long-term dependencies.

2. **Billion Words**: This dataset is a large-scale language modeling benchmark that contains a vast amount of text data, specifically designed for training language models.

3. **Wikitext**: This dataset consists of text extracted from Wikipedia, used for language modeling tasks. The paper mentions two versions: WikiText-2 and WikiText-103, with WikiText-103 being a larger version.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Sequential MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Lee, J., et al. "SNIP: Single-shot network pruning based on connection sensitivity." arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.02340, 2018.

- For **Billion Words**, the citation is:
  > Chelba, C., et al. "One billion word benchmark for measuring progress in statistical language modeling." arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.3005, 2013.

- For **Wikitext**, the citation is:
  > Merity, S., et al. "Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models." arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.07843, 2016.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
