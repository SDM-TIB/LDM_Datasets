To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RNN-based RSF" by Joaquin Garcia-Suarez, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of synthetic data generated from traditional rate-and-state friction equations, which suggests that there is a dataset involved, but it does not provide a specific name.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly the subsection on **synthetic data generation**. Here, the author describes how they generated a dataset for training and verification purposes. They mention simulating 15,000 random sequences based on specific parameters of the rate-and-state friction model. However, this dataset does not have a formal name or citation, as it is synthetic data created for the purpose of the study.

I will also look for any references to existing datasets in the **discussion** or **acknowledgments** sections. However, the paper primarily focuses on the synthetic dataset created by the author and does not reference any external datasets.

Since the paper does not provide any formal citations for datasets, I will note that the primary dataset discussed is the synthetic dataset generated for the study. The details of this dataset include:

- **Dataset Name**: Synthetic Dataset for Rate-and-State Friction (no formal citation)
- **Description**: The dataset consists of 15,000 sequences simulating diverse frictional sliding scenarios based on the rate-and-state friction model. Each sequence includes features representing the velocity protocol and targets corresponding to variations in the friction coefficient.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and note that while the paper does not cite any external datasets, it relies heavily on the synthetic dataset it generated for its experiments. I will ensure to document this information clearly, as it is crucial for understanding the context of the research.
