To extract datasets from the research paper titled "From English to Code-Switching: Transfer Learning with Strong Morphological Clues" by Gustavo Aguilar and Thamar Solorio, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract highlights the focus on code-switched text and mentions the use of different language pairs, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will look for specific names, descriptions, and any relevant details about the datasets.

In section 4, the authors mention three primary datasets for language identification:

1. **Nepali-English Dataset**: Collected from Twitter, introduced at the CALCS workshop in 2014. This dataset contains a significant number of posts and tokens, and it follows the CALCS label scheme.

2. **Spanish-English Dataset**: Also collected from Twitter, introduced at the CALCS workshop in 2016. Similar to the Nepali-English dataset, it follows the CALCS label scheme and has a detailed distribution of language labels.

3. **Hindi-English Dataset**: This dataset includes Twitter and Facebook posts and was introduced by Mave et al. in 2018. It also follows the CALCS label scheme and has a distribution of language labels.

The authors provide a detailed breakdown of the datasets, including the number of posts, tokens, and label distributions, which is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Nepali-English Dataset**:

In Proceedings of the First Workshop on Computational Approaches to Code Switching, pages 62–72, Doha, Qatar, 2014.

- For the **Spanish-English Dataset**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the research paper.
