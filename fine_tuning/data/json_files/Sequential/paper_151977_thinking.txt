To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Spatial Regression Model for Image Crowd Counting" by Haiyan Yao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their framework on several challenging crowd counting datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors describe their experiments on various datasets. This section is likely to contain the most relevant information regarding the datasets used.

In **subsection 4.1 (Experiment on the Shanghaitech dataset)**, the authors describe the **Shanghaitech dataset**, which includes 1198 images with approximately 330,165 humans annotated. They mention that it is split into two parts: Part_A (482 high-density images) and Part_B (716 medium-density images). This is a clear identification of a dataset.

In **subsection 4.2 (Experiment on the UCF_CC_50 dataset)**, the authors discuss the **UCF_CC_50 dataset**, which consists of 50 grayscale images with varying crowd counts. This dataset is also clearly defined.

In **subsection 4.3 (Experiment on the AHU-CROWD dataset)**, the authors mention the **AHU-CROWD dataset**, which contains 107 images with a total of 45,000 annotated humans. This dataset is another important entry.

In **subsection 4.4 (Experiment on the WorldExpo’10 dataset)**, the authors refer to the **WorldExpo’10 dataset**, which consists of 1132 annotated video sequences captured during the 2010 World Expo. This dataset is also clearly defined.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for each of these datasets:

1. **Shanghaitech Dataset**:
   > Shanghaitech Dataset. *Crowd Counting Dataset*. Available at: [http://shanghaitech.edu.cn/](http://shanghaitech.edu.cn/).

2. **UCF_CC_50 Dataset**:
   > Idrees, H., et al. "Multi-source Multi-scale Counting in Extremely Dense Crowd Images." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2013, pp. 2547-2554.

3. **AHU-CROWD Dataset**:
   > Hu, Y., et al. "Dense crowd counting from still images with convolutional neural networks." Journal of Visual Communication & Image Representation, 38.C (2016), pp. 530-539.

4. **WorldExpo’10 Dataset**:
   > Zhang, C., et al. "Cross-scene crowd counting via deep convolutional neural networks." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015, pp. 833-841.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately for further processing or review.
