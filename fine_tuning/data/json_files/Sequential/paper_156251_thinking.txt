To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Category Trees for ID-Based Recommendation: Exploring the Power of Differentiable Vector Quantization" by Qijiong Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors validate their method on various recommendation tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they conducted offline experiments on three recommendation tasks: list completion, collaborative filtering, and click-through rate prediction. They list the datasets used for each task:

1. **List Completion Task**: The authors mention using three real-world datasets: **Zhihu**, **Spotify**, and **Goodreads**. 

2. **Collaborative Filtering Task**: They utilize five public datasets: **Amazon Toys**, **Amazon Kindle Store**, **Amazon Phones**, **Amazon Grocery**, and **MovieLens (1M version)**.

3. **Click-Through Rate Prediction Task**: The datasets mentioned are **MIND (small version)** and **MovieLens (100K version)**.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Zhihu Dataset**: The authors do not provide a specific citation in the paper, but it is commonly known in the recommendation community.
  
- **Spotify Dataset**: Similar to Zhihu, the authors do not provide a specific citation, but it is widely used in recommendation research.

- **Goodreads Dataset**: The authors do not provide a specific citation, but it is a well-known dataset for book recommendations.

- **Amazon Datasets**: The citation for the Amazon datasets is:
  > J. McAuley and J. Leskovec. *From Amateurs to Connoisseurs: Modeling the Evolution of User Expertise through Online Reviews*. In Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), pages 897–908, 2013.

- **MovieLens Datasets**: The citation for the MovieLens datasets is:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS), 5(4):1–19, 2015.

- **MIND Dataset**: The citation for the MIND dataset is:
  > Fangzhao Wu et al. *MIND: A Large-Scale Dataset for News Recommendation*. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 3597–3606, 2020.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
