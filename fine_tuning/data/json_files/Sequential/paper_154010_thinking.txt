To extract datasets from the research paper titled "What They Do When in Doubt: A Study of Inductive Biases in Seq2Seq Learners" by Eugene Kharitonov and Rahma Chaabouni, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or tasks that involve datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that describe the tasks used to evaluate the seq2seq learners. The authors mention four new tasks: **Count-or-Memorization, Add-or-Multiply, Hierarchical-or-Linear, and Composition-or-Memorization**. I will check if these tasks are based on existing datasets or if they are synthetic tasks created for the purpose of this study.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any details about the datasets used for training and evaluation. If the authors mention that the tasks are based on synthetic datasets, I will note that down as well.

After identifying the tasks, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited or if there are any foundational papers that describe the datasets used in these tasks. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will extract the full citations for those datasets.

For example, if the authors mention that the tasks are inspired by existing datasets or benchmarks, I will ensure to include those references. If they created synthetic datasets, I will note that these datasets are not publicly available or do not have formal citations.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, if applicable. This will include noting whether the dataset is synthetic or sourced from existing literature.

By following this structured approach, I will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets mentioned in the paper, along with their proper citations.
