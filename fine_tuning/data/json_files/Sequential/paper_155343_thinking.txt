To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Word Embeddings to Analyze Protests News" by Maria Alejandra Cardoza Ceron, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. These sections often provide a high-level overview of the research and may mention the datasets used. In this case, the introduction discusses the CLEF 2019 ProtestNews event and mentions the use of datasets for binary classification tasks related to protest news.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Tasks and Dataset)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for the experiments. Here, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant statistics.

In **subsection 3.1 (Task 1)**, the paper describes the datasets used for classifying news articles into protest and non-protest categories. The datasets mentioned include:
1. A large, labelled training dataset consisting of English news articles from India.
2. A smaller, labelled development dataset for testing models, also consisting of English news articles from India.
3. An unlabelled testing dataset with English texts from Indian news articles.
4. An unlabelled testing dataset with English texts from Chinese news articles.

In **subsection 3.2 (Task 2)**, the paper outlines similar datasets for event sentence detection, which include:
1. A large, labelled training dataset consisting of English sentences extracted from news articles from India.
2. A smaller, labelled development dataset for testing models, also consisting of English sentences from India.
3. An unlabelled testing dataset with English sentences from Indian news articles.
4. An unlabelled testing dataset with English sentences from Chinese news articles.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that the datasets were acquired from online English news articles from India and China, and that the binary labelling was done manually. However, it does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely derived from the CLEF 2019 ProtestNews event.

Since the datasets are part of a larger event, I will cite the event itself as the source of the datasets:
- For the CLEF 2019 ProtestNews event, the citation is:

Springer International Publishing, Cham, 2019.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that I have accurately represented the datasets used in the research.
