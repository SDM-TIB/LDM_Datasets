To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lifelong Property Price Prediction: A Case Study for the Toronto Real Estate Market" by Hao Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their model to "large, real-life datasets obtained from the Toronto real estate market," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly where the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention three datasets:

1. **TorC-H**: This dataset consists of sampled house transactions spanning over 31 months in a district in Toronto city, with a total of 31,000 houses and 155,834 nodes in the heterogeneous information network (HIN).

2. **TorC-A**: This dataset includes sampled apartment transactions over 75 months in a district in Toronto city, containing 37,500 houses and 127,955 nodes in the HIN.

3. **Tor-H**: This dataset encompasses sampled house transactions across the entire Toronto Region, covering a larger area and a time span of 63 months, with 618,339 houses and 3,093,180 nodes in the HIN.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from the Toronto Real Estate Board, they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets. Instead, I will note that the datasets are based on transaction records from the Toronto Real Estate Board, which is a recognized source.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the context in which they were used in the experiments and any relevant details about their structure and size.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear format, making sure to emphasize the importance of each dataset in the context of the research and its contributions to the field of property price prediction.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

- **TorC-H**: 31,000 houses, 155,834 nodes, 31 months.
- **TorC-A**: 37,500 houses, 127,955 nodes, 75 months.
- **Tor-H**: 618,339 houses, 3,093,180 nodes, 63 months.

The datasets are based on transaction records from the Toronto Real Estate Board, which is a key source for real estate data in the region. This information will be crucial for any further analysis or replication of the study.
