To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long-Term Forecasting using Higher-Order Tensor RNNs" by Rose Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for validation. The introduction often elaborates on the problem being addressed and may reference specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **Genz Functions**: The authors state that Genz functions are used for evaluating high-dimensional function approximation. They generated datasets with 10,000 samples for various Genz functions.

2. **Traffic Dataset**: This dataset consists of traffic data collected from the Los Angeles County highway network, aggregated every 5 minutes over 4 months. The authors mention that they imputed missing values and treated each sequence as daily traffic measurements.

3. **Climate Dataset**: The dataset includes daily maximum temperature data from the U.S. Historical Climatology Network, covering over 124 years and 54 stations in California. The authors describe how they processed the data and augmented it for analysis.

After identifying the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. However, the datasets mentioned in the paper are not typically cited in the same way as academic papers. Instead, I will provide a description of the source or the original dataset documentation where applicable.

Now, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and any relevant citations:

1. **Genz Functions Dataset**: 
   - Description: A collection of datasets generated from various Genz functions, commonly used for evaluating high-dimensional function approximation.
   - Citation: Bigoni, D., Engsig-Karup, A. P., & Marzouk, Y. M. (2016). Spectral tensor-train decomposition. SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 38(4), A2405â€“A2439.

2. **Traffic Dataset**: 
   - Description: Traffic data from the Los Angeles County highway network, collected by the California Department of Transportation, consisting of speed readings aggregated every 5 minutes over 4 months.
   - Citation: California Department of Transportation. (n.d.). Traffic data. Retrieved from http://pems.dot.ca.gov/

3. **Climate Dataset**: 
   - Description: Daily maximum temperature data from the U.S. Historical Climatology Network, covering over 124 years and 54 stations in California.
   - Citation: U.S. Historical Climatology Network. (n.d.). Daily temperature data. Retrieved from http://cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/ushcn_daily/

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that I have accurately captured the essence of each dataset along with its citation.
