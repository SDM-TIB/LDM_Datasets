To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A comparative study of neural network techniques for automatic software vulnerability detection" by Gaigai Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments and refers to "three data-sets" used in their experiments. This indicates that specific datasets are likely detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the relevant information is found in **Section IV (Experiment and Evaluation)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention three datasets:

1. **BE-ALL**: This dataset consists of samples with Buffer Error vulnerabilities (CWE-119) and includes a total of 39,753 code gadgets, with 10,440 labeled as vulnerable.

2. **RM-ALL**: This dataset contains samples with Resource Management error vulnerabilities (CWE-399) and has 21,885 code gadgets, with 7,285 labeled as vulnerable.

3. **HY-ALL**: This dataset includes samples with both HYbrid buffer error vulnerabilities (CWE-119) and resource management error vulnerabilities (CWE-399), totaling 61,638 code gadgets, with 17,725 labeled as vulnerable.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the datasets themselves are not typically cited in the references; instead, they are described in the context of the experiments. The authors reference the original work related to the datasets, particularly the VulDeePecker system, which is a significant contribution in the field.

The relevant citations for the datasets based on the context provided in the paper are:

- For **BE-ALL**, **RM-ALL**, and **HY-ALL**, the authors refer to the work of Zhen Li et al. on VulDeePecker:
  > Zhen Li, Deqing Zou, Shouhuai Xu, et al. *Vuldeepecker: A deep learning-based system for vulnerability detection*. In 25th Annual Network and Distributed System Security Symposium, NDSS 2018, San Diego, California, USA, February 18-21, 2018.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
