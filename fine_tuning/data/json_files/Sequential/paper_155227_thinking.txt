To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Demand Prediction for Multimodal Systems: A Multi-Task Multi-Relational Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network Approach," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions that the study uses real-world subway and ride-hailing datasets from New York City, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any relevant sections that describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, the datasets are described in **section 4.1 (Data Description)**. Here, the authors provide specific details about the datasets used:

1. **NYC Subway Dataset**: This dataset includes turnstile usage counts from 136 subway stations in New York City, with data collected every 4 hours. It consists of approximately 2.4 million entry/exit counts daily.

2. **NYC Ride-hailing Dataset**: This dataset is provided by the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission and includes trip records from ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft. It contains 43 million trip records over the study period, with an average of 234,000 trips per day.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the datasets themselves are not typically cited in the references; instead, they are described in the text. Therefore, I will summarize the information as follows:

- For the **NYC Subway Dataset**, the citation is:
  > NYC Subway Turnstile Data. Available at: https://toddwschneider.com/dashboards/nyc-subway-turnstiles

- For the **NYC Ride-hailing Dataset**, the citation is:
  > NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) Trip Record Data. Available at: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will allow for proper documentation and referencing of the datasets used in the research.
