To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Multi-scale Attention Networks for Action Recognition" by Shiyang Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets they evaluated their model on. Here, they state that they tested their approach on three widely used datasets: **UCF sports**, **Olympic sports**, and **HMDB51**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of each dataset in the **experiments section**. The authors provide specific information about each dataset:

1. **UCF Sports Dataset**: This dataset consists of 150 videos with a resolution of 720 × 480 and includes 10 different action categories. The authors mention that they manually divided the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. **Olympic Sports Dataset**: Collected from YouTube, this dataset contains 800 videos across 16 different sports categories, with 50 videos per class. The authors use the original training-testing split provided in the dataset.

3. **HMDB51 Dataset**: This is a more challenging dataset that includes 5100 videos labeled with 51 action categories. The authors follow the original training-testing split for evaluation.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets:

- For the **UCF Sports Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Rodriguez, M. (2010). *Spatio-temporal maximum average correlation height templates in action recognition and video summarization*.

- For the **Olympic Sports Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Niebles, J. C., Chen, C.-W., & Fei-Fei, L. (2010). *Modeling temporal structure of decomposable motion segments for activity classification*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (pp. 392–405).

- For the **HMDB51 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kuehne, H., Jhuang, H., Garrote, E., Poggio, T., & Serre, T. (2011). *HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
