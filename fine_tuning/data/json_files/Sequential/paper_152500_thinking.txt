To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Language Identification in Code-Mixed Data using Multichannel Neural Networks and Context Capture" by Soumil Mandal et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved high accuracy on two testing sets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data Sets)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they tested their approach on two different language pairs: **Bengali-English (Bn-En)** and **Hindi-English (Hi-En)**. 

For the **Bengali-English (Bn-En)** dataset, the authors refer to data prepared in a previous work by Mandal et al. (2018b). For the **Hindi-English (Hi-En)** dataset, they cite data prepared in another work by Patra et al. (2018). The number of instances for each dataset is specified, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's scale.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Bengali-English (Bn-En)** dataset, the citation is:
   > Soumil Mandal, Sainik Kumar Mahata, and Dipankar Das. *Preparing Bengali-English Code-Mixed Corpus for Sentiment Analysis of Indian Languages*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1803.04000, 2018.

2. For the **Hindi-English (Hi-En)** dataset, the citation is:
   > Braja Gopal Patra, Dipankar Das, and Amitava Das. *Sentiment Analysis of Code-Mixed Indian Languages: An Overview of SAIL Code-Mixed Shared Task@ ICON-2017*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1803.06745, 2018.

Having gathered this information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will be crucial for any further analysis or application of the datasets in related research.
