To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Single headed attention based sequence-to-sequence model for state-of-the-art results on Switchboard" by Zoltán Tüske et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions achieving state-of-the-art performance on the **Switchboard-300 database**, which indicates that this dataset is likely central to the research.

Next, in the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of data sparsity in speech recognition and highlight the importance of the **Switchboard-300** dataset. This reinforces the idea that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors explicitly state that they focus on the **Switchboard-300** dataset, which is a standard 300-hour English conversational speech recognition task. This confirms that the dataset is indeed used for their experiments.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **results section** or any other relevant sections. The authors reference **Hub5’00** and **Hub5’01** as development and test sets, respectively, which are also important for understanding the context of their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **Switchboard-300 dataset**, the citation is:
   > "Switchboard-300 corpus," available at: https://www.isip.piconepress.com/projects/switchboard.

2. For the **Hub5’00 dataset**, the citation is:
   > "Hub5’00 corpus," available at: https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/tests/hub5.

3. For the **Hub5’01 dataset**, the citation is:
   > "Hub5’01 corpus," available at: https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/tests/hub5.

Having gathered this information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
