To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Monocular 3D Vehicle Detection and Tracking" by Hou-Ning Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **simulation, KITTI, and Argoverse datasets**, which suggests that these datasets are relevant to their research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors detail their evaluation methods. They mention using the **KITTI Tracking benchmark** and the **Argoverse Tracking benchmark** for their experiments. This confirms that both datasets are utilized in their research.

In the **dataset section**, the authors describe their own dataset created from a simulation based on Grand Theft Auto V. They explain that this dataset provides accurate 3D bounding box annotations and is designed to overcome the limitations of existing datasets. They also mention that their dataset is the largest 3D tracking benchmark for dynamic scene understanding.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: The citation for the KITTI dataset is:
   > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 335–342, 2012.

2. **Argoverse Dataset**: The citation for the Argoverse dataset is:
   > Ming-Fang Chang, John Lambert, Patsorn Sangkloy, Jagjeet Singh, Slawomir Bak, Andrew Hartnett, De Wang, Peter Carr, Simon Lucey, Deva Ramanan, and James Hays. *Argoverse: 3D tracking and forecasting with rich maps*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 874–883, 2019.

3. **GTA Dataset**: The authors describe their own dataset created from Grand Theft Auto V, but they do not provide a formal citation for it in the references. However, they reference their methodology based on:
   > Stephan R. Richter, Zeeshan Hayder, and Vladlen Koltun. *Playing for data: Ground truth from computer games*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 102–118, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

- **KITTI Dataset**: Used for real-world driving scenario evaluation.
- **Argoverse Dataset**: Used for 3D tracking and forecasting.
- **GTA Dataset**: A synthetic dataset created for the purpose of this research, based on Grand Theft Auto V.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
