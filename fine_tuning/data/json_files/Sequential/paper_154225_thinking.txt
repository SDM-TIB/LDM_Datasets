To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Text-based RL Agents with Commonsense Knowledge: New Challenges, Environments and Baselines" by Keerthiram Murugesan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the creation of a new environment called **TextWorld Commonsense (TWC)**, which suggests that there may be datasets associated with this environment.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (TextWorld Commonsense)**, where the authors describe the construction of the TWC environment. Here, they mention that they built a dataset that lists several kinds of objects typically found in a house environment, which is crucial for the TWC setup. This indicates that there is a dataset related to the objects and their properties.

In **subsection 2.1 (Constructing TWC)**, the authors provide details about the dataset used to create instances of the TWC environment. They mention that they collected vocabulary terms from various sources, including:
1. The picture dictionary from 7ESL.
2. The British Councilâ€™s vocabulary learning page.
3. The English At Home vocabulary learning page.
4. ESOL courses.

This section also states that they manually aggregated this content to build a dataset that specifies plausible locations for various objects. 

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors discuss the performance of RL agents in the TWC environment, but they do not introduce new datasets here. Instead, they focus on the evaluation of the agents using the TWC environment.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide formal citations for the datasets used to construct TWC, but I can summarize the sources mentioned:

1. **TextWorld Commonsense (TWC) Dataset**: This dataset is constructed from various sources, including:
   - 7ESL Picture Dictionary: 
     > 7ESL. *Picture Dictionary*. Available at: https://7esl.com/picture-dictionary
   - British Council Vocabulary Learning Page:
     > British Council. *Vocabulary Learning Page*. Available at: https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/vocabulary/beginner-to-pre-intermediate
   - English At Home Vocabulary Learning Page:
     > English At Home. *Vocabulary Learning Page*. Available at: https://www.english-at-home.com/vocabulary
   - ESOL Courses:
     > ESOL Courses. *Household and Home Vocabulary*. Available at: https://www.esolcourses.com/topics/household-home.html

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the datasets used in the research, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as specified.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their sources from the research paper.
