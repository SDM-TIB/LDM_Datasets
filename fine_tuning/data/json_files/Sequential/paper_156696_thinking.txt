To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Information Leakage from Embedding in Large Language Models" by Zhipeng Wan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on privacy concerns related to embeddings in large language models, but it does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**, particularly **section 5.1.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their study. Here, I find the following datasets:

1. **Fingpt-sentiment**: This dataset is designed for sentiment analysis within the financial domain and comprises 76.8K lines of data.

2. **Fingpt-ﬁqa qa**: This dataset is tailored for training question-answering models in the financial sector, containing 17.1K lines of data.

3. **Wikitext-2-raw-v1**: This dataset represents curated content from Wikipedia and consists of 44.8K lines of data.

The authors also mention that they randomized these datasets and allocated 20% of the data to form separate test sets for each, which is important for understanding their experimental setup.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Fingpt-sentiment**, the citation is:
  > Yang, H., Liu, X.-Y., & Wang, C. D. (2023). Fingpt: Open-source financial large language models.

- For **Fingpt-ﬁqa qa**, the citation is the same as for Fingpt-sentiment since both datasets are part of the Fingpt project.

- For **Wikitext-2-raw-v1**, the citation is:
  > Merity, S., Xiong, C., Bradbury, J., & Socher, R. (2016). Pointer sentinel mixture models. In Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2016.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, along with their respective references for further exploration.
