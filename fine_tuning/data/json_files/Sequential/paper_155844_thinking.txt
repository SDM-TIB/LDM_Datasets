To extract datasets from the research paper titled "(Psycho-)Linguistic Features Meet Transformer Models for Improved Explainable and Controllable Text Simplification" by Yu Qiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, particularly **subsection 3.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **WikiLarge**: This dataset consists of parallel-aligned "Wikipedia-simple-Wikipedia" sentence pairs, which is crucial for text simplification tasks.
2. **Newsela**: This dataset comprises news articles that have been simplified by professional editors, providing a rich source of complex-simple sentence pairs.
3. **Biendata**: This dataset includes matches of research papers from various scientific disciplines with press releases describing them, which adds a unique dimension to the simplification task.

After identifying the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **WikiLarge**:
  > Zhang, Y., & Lapata, M. (2017). *Sentence simplification with deep reinforcement learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.10931.

- For **Newsela**:
  > Xu, C., Napoles, C., & Callison-Burch, C. (2015). *Problems in current text simplification research: New data can help*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 3, 283-297.

- For **Biendata**:
  > Biendata. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.biendata.com/competition/hackathon.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for future reference.
