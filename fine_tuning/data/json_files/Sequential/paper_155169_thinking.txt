To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UFO: A UniFied TransfOrmer for Vision-Language Representation Learning" by Jianfeng Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved state-of-the-art results on various tasks, which suggests that they likely used specific datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they mention that they combined **four datasets for vision-language pre-training**: 

1. **MS COCO**: This dataset is widely used for image captioning and visual question answering tasks. It contains 113,000 images and 567,000 captions.
2. **Conceptual Captions (CC)**: This dataset consists of 3.1 million images with 875,000 associated captions.
3. **SBU**: This dataset also contains 3.1 million images and 875,000 captions.
4. **Visual Genome (VG)**: This dataset includes 108,000 images and 4.2 million captions.

The authors provide statistics for each dataset, which confirms their usage in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MS COCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge J. Belongie, Lubomir D. Bourdev, Ross B. Girshick, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr DollÃ¡r, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: common objects in context*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1405.0312, 2014.

- For **Conceptual Captions (CC)**, the citation is:
  > Piyush Sharma, Nan Ding, Sebastian Goodman, and Radu Soricut. *Conceptual captions: A cleaned, hypernymed, image alt-text dataset for automatic image captioning*. In ACL, 2018.

- For **SBU**, the citation is:
  > Vicente Ordonez, Girish Kulkarni, and Tamara L. Berg. *Im2text: Describing images using 1 million captioned photographs*. In NeurIPS, 2011.

- For **Visual Genome (VG)**, the citation is:
  > Ranjay Krishna, Yuke Zhu, Oliver Groth, Justin Johnson, Kenji Hata, Joshua Kravitz, Stephanie Chen, Yannis Kalandidis, Li-Jia Li, David A. Shamma, Michael S. Bernstein, and Fei-Fei Li. *Visual genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1602.07332, 2016.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
