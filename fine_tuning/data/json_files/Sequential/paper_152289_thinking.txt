To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Learning to Perceive and Reason About Liquids" by Connor Schenck and Dieter Fox, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors generated a dataset with 10,122 pouring sequences, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Methodology)**, particularly the **3.1 Data Generation** subsection, where the authors describe the process of generating their dataset. They mention using a realistic liquid simulator and rendering engine to create a dataset consisting of 10,122 pouring sequences, each lasting 15 seconds, resulting in over 4.5 million labeled images. This section provides essential details about the dataset's size and the nature of the data.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **experiments** or **results** sections, but it appears that the primary dataset used for their evaluations is the one generated through their simulation process.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the tools and methods used to generate the dataset. The authors mention using Blender for data generation, which is a key component of their dataset creation process. The citation for Blender is:

- Blender Online Community. *Blender - A 3D modelling and rendering package*. Blender Foundation, Blender Institute, Amsterdam, 2016.

Since the dataset itself does not have a formal citation like a published dataset would, I will note the details provided in the paper regarding the dataset's creation and the tools used.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and the relevant citations for the tools used in its creation. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the dataset as described in the paper.
