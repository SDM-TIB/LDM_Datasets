To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantifying and Predicting Residential Building Flexibility Using Machine Learning Methods" by Patrick Salter, Qiuhua Huang, and Paulo Cesar Tabares-Velasco, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the study.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of predicting flexibility in residential buildings and mention the use of machine learning models. However, they do not specify any datasets here, so I will move on to the methodology.

In **Section II (Flexibility Metrics and Machine Learning Methods for Forecasting)**, the authors describe the use of the EnergyPlus simulation tool with the U.S. Department of Energy’s prototype home models. This indicates that the dataset is derived from simulations rather than a pre-existing dataset. The authors mention that they used disaggregated load data from the house, which is generated through the EnergyPlus simulations.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets used. The references include several papers that discuss energy flexibility and building simulations, but they do not provide a specific dataset citation for the EnergyPlus simulations. However, I can note that the EnergyPlus tool itself is a widely recognized dataset generator in building energy modeling.

The relevant citation for the EnergyPlus tool is:
> NREL/EnergyPlus: EnergyPlus™ is a whole building energy simulation program that engineers, architects, and researchers use to model both energy consumption and water use in buildings. Available at: https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus.

Additionally, the authors reference the U.S. Department of Energy’s prototype home models, which can be cited as:
> U.S. Department of Energy. Prototype Building Models — Building Energy Codes Program. Available at: https://www.energycodes.gov/prototype-building-models.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **EnergyPlus Simulation Data**: This dataset is generated using the EnergyPlus simulation tool, which models energy consumption and water use in buildings. It is used to create disaggregated load data for training and testing the forecasting models.

2. **U.S. Department of Energy’s Prototype Home Models**: These models are used in conjunction with EnergyPlus to simulate residential building energy consumption and flexibility metrics.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their citations for clarity and completeness.
