To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Novel Approach to Intrusion Detection: Introducing GAN-MSCNN-BILSTM with LIME Predictions" by Asmaa BENCHAMA and Khalid ZEBBARA, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the proposed system on the **Hogzilla dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for more details about the **Hogzilla dataset** in the **experiments section**. The authors describe the dataset as a compilation of network flows sourced from the CTU-13 Botnet and ISCX 2012 IDS datasets, which provides a comprehensive repository of both botnet behavioral data and normal network traffic. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's context and application.

In the **methodology section**, the authors discuss how they preprocess the Hogzilla dataset, transforming attack labels into three distinct classes: 'Acceptable', 'Unrated', and 'Unsafe'. This preprocessing step is important for understanding how the dataset is utilized in their model.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Hogzilla dataset. The paper cites the dataset as follows:

- For the **Hogzilla dataset**, the citation is:
  > Benchama A, Bensoltane R, Zebbara K. *Network Intrusion System Detection Using Machine and Deep Learning Models: A Comparative Study*. In: Farhaoui Y, Hussain A, Saba T, Taherdoost H, Verma A, editors. Artificial Intelligence, Data Science and Applications. Cham: Springer Nature Switzerland; 2024. p. 271-280.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the dataset, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Hogzilla dataset, ensuring that it is clear and concise, ready for any structured output or further processing.
