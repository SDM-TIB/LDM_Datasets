To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Entity-Assisted Language Models for Identifying Check-Worthy Sentences" by Ting Su, Craig Macdonald, and Iadh Ounis, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their framework using two publicly available datasets from the **CLEF’ 2019 & 2020 CheckThat! Labs**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the introduction, the authors reference the **CLEF’ 2019 & 2020 CheckThat! Labs**, which is a strong indication that these datasets are central to their experiments.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors explicitly mention using the **CLEF’2019 CheckThat! dataset** and the **CLEF’2020 CheckThat! dataset** for their evaluations. They describe these datasets as consisting of transcripts of US political debates and speeches collected from various news outlets, with sentences labeled as check-worthy based on fact-checking.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are typically included in the references, and I will look for entries that correspond to the CLEF CheckThat! Labs.

The full citations I find are:

1. For the **CLEF’2019 CheckThat! dataset**:
   > Pepa Atanasova, Preslav Nakov, Georgi Karadzhov, Mitra Mohtarami, and Giovanni Da San Martino. *Overview of the CLEF-2019 CheckThat! Lab on automatic identification and verification of claims. task 1: Check-worthiness*. In Proceedings of CLEF in CEUR Workshop, 2019.

2. For the **CLEF’2020 CheckThat! dataset**:
   > Giovanni Da San Martino, Maram Hasanain, Reem Suwaileh, Fatima Haouari, Nikolay Babulkov, Bayan Hamdan, Alex Nikolov, Shaden Shaar, and Zien Sheikh Ali. *Overview of CheckThat! 2020: Automatic identification and verification of claims in social media*. In Proceedings of CLEF in CEUR Workshop, 2020.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **CLEF’2019 CheckThat! dataset**: Contains transcripts of US political debates and speeches, with sentences labeled as check-worthy based on fact-checking.
2. **CLEF’2020 CheckThat! dataset**: Similar to the 2019 dataset, it includes transcripts from political debates and speeches, also labeled for check-worthiness.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that the citations are correctly formatted for future use.
