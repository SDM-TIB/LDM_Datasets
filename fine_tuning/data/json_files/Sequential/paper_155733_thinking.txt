To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RAPIDAI4EO: Mono- and Multi-Temporal Deep Learning Models for Updating the Corine Land Cover Product" by P. Bhugra et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **RapidAI4EO dataset** for evaluating multi-temporal versus mono-temporal satellite images, which indicates that this dataset is significant for the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (specifically section 3) where the authors describe their dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the **RapidAI4EO dataset** consists of 500,000 patches across the European Economic Area (EEA39) and includes imagery from Planet Fusion and Sentinel-2. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's composition and purpose.

I will also check the **related work section** and **model inference and applications** sections for any additional datasets or references to other datasets that may have been used in conjunction with the RapidAI4EO dataset. However, the primary focus seems to be on the RapidAI4EO dataset itself.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the RapidAI4EO dataset. The relevant citation is:

- Giovanni Marchisio, Patrick Helber, Benjamin Bischke, Timothy Davis, CÂ¸ aglar Senaras, Daniele Zanaga, Ruben Van De Kerchove, and Annett Wania. "Rapidai4eo: A corpus for higher spatial and temporal reasoning." CoRR, vol. abs/2110.01919, 2021.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will focus solely on the RapidAI4EO dataset for my extraction.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
