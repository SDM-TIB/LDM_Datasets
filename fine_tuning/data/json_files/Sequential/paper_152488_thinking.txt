To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fake Sentence Detection as a Training Task for Sentence Encoding" by Viresh Ranjan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of fake sentence detection as a training task but does not specify any datasets. The introduction also focuses on the methodology rather than specific datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Evaluation Setup)**, where the authors discuss the downstream tasks and the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they list several datasets associated with various tasks:

1. **MR (Movie Review)**: This dataset contains 11,000 sentences used for sentiment analysis.
2. **CR (Product Review)**: This dataset consists of 4,000 sentences also used for sentiment analysis.
3. **TREC (Question Classification)**: This dataset includes 11,000 sentences for classifying questions into different types.
4. **SST (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)**: This dataset has 70,000 sentences for sentiment analysis.
5. **MPQA (Multi-Perspective Question Answering)**: This dataset contains 11,000 sentences for opinion polarity classification.
6. **SUBJ (Subjectivity)**: This dataset includes 10,000 sentences for subjectivity classification.
7. **SICK (Sentences Involving Compositional Knowledge)**: This dataset is used for natural language inference and contains 10,000 sentence pairs.
8. **COCO (Common Objects in Context)**: This dataset is used for image and caption retrieval tasks and contains 123,000 images with associated captions.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the following sources:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be documented with its name, description, and full citation to ensure proper attribution.
