To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Textual Prompt Guided Image Restoration" by Qiuhai Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that extensive experiments were conducted on public denoising, dehazing, and deraining datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Experiment Settings)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention several datasets:

1. **BSD400**: This dataset consists of 400 clear natural images used for image denoising.
2. **CBSD68**: This dataset comprises 68 clear color images, also used for image denoising.
3. **Urban100**: This dataset contains 100 clear natural images, utilized for image denoising.
4. **WED**: The Waterloo Exploration Database includes a total of 4744 images, used for image denoising.
5. **Rain100L**: This dataset includes 200 rainy-clear training image pairs and 100 testing image pairs, specifically for image deraining.
6. **RESIDE**: This dataset is used for image dehazing, with the SOTS subset containing 72,135 images for training and the OTS subset with 500 images for testing.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
