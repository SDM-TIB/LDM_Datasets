To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GraphNAS: Graph Neural Architecture Search with Reinforcement Learning" by Yang Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on various citation networks and a protein-protein interaction network, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Cora Dataset**: This dataset is used for classifying academic papers into different subjects. It has been preprocessed according to the settings used in semi-GCN.

2. **Citeseer Dataset**: Similar to Cora, this dataset is also used for academic paper classification and follows the same preprocessing steps.

3. **Pubmed Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for the same classification task and has also been preprocessed in line with the semi-GCN settings.

4. **Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Dataset**: This dataset is used for inductive learning tasks and contains multiple graphs for training, validation, and testing.

I will then verify the details of these datasets by checking the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Cora Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Thomas N. Kipf and Max Welling. *Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks*. In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2017.

- For the **Citeseer Dataset**, the citation is:
  > William L. Hamilton, Zhitao Ying, and Jure Leskovec. *Inductive representation learning on large graphs*. In NIPS, 2017.

- For the **Pubmed Dataset**, the citation is:
  > K. Xu, W. Hu, J. Leskovec, and S. Jegelka. *How powerful are graph neural networks?* CoRR, abs/1810.00826, 2018.

- For the **PPI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Z. Yang, W. Ying, and J. Leskovec. *Graph convolutional networks for social recommendation*. In Proceedings of the 11th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, 2017.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research.
