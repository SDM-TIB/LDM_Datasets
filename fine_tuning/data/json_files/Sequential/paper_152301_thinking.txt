To extract datasets from the research paper titled "sk_p: a neural program corrector for MOOCs" by Yewen Pu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on various programming assignments, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for training and testing. In this section, they mention that they evaluate their model on **seven different Python programming assignments**. I will look for specific names of these assignments, as they likely represent the datasets used.

Upon reviewing the text, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **computeDeriv**: This dataset consists of programming assignments related to computing derivatives. The authors mention that it has a training set of 1252 correct programs and a testing set of 263 incorrect programs.

2. **computeRoot**: This dataset is focused on computing roots and includes 1617 training programs and 84 testing programs.

3. **evaluatePoly**: This dataset involves evaluating polynomials, with 2313 training programs and 97 testing programs.

4. **getAvailableLetters**: This dataset has 1051 training programs and 59 testing programs, related to letter availability in a given context.

5. **getGuessedWord**: This dataset consists of 315 training programs and 127 testing programs, likely related to guessing words based on certain criteria.

6. **isWordGuessed**: This dataset includes 902 training programs and 109 testing programs, focusing on determining if a word has been guessed.

7. **oddTuples**: This dataset has 8720 training programs and 1981 testing programs, which likely involves generating tuples based on specific conditions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets that may have been referenced in prior works. However, in this case, the datasets appear to be original to the authors' experiments and do not have external citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full names and descriptions of each dataset, along with their respective training and testing sizes. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its name, description, and sizes.
