To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequential Learning of Convolutional Features for Effective Text Classification" by Avinash Madasu and Vijjini Anvesh Rao, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their model on various text classification datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be listed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for testing their model. In this section, they list the following datasets:

1. **Rotten-Tomatoes (RT)**: This dataset is referenced as being used for sentiment analysis and is attributed to Pang and Lee (2005).

2. **Polarity V2.0 (Pol)**: Another sentiment analysis dataset, also attributed to Pang and Lee (2004).

3. **SST-2**: This dataset is mentioned for sentiment classification and is attributed to Socher et al. (2013).

4. **Home and Kitchen reviews (AR)**: This dataset is referenced for product reviews and is attributed to He and McAuley (2016).

5. **TREC**: This dataset is used for question classification and is attributed to Li and Roth (2002).

6. **IMDB**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis and is attributed to Maas et al. (2011).

7. **Subjectivity Objectivity (SO)**: This dataset is also for sentiment analysis and is attributed to Pang and Lee (2004).

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
