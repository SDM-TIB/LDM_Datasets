To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep LSTM for Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition" by Xu Tian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their models on **Shenma voice search data** and **Amap voice search data**, which suggests that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Training Data)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **Shenma Voice Search Dataset**: This dataset consists of 17,000 hours of labeled data collected from anonymous online usersâ€™ search queries in Mandarin. It is noted for its diverse conditions, including various noise levels and accents.

2. **Amap Voice Search Dataset**: This dataset contains 7,300 hours of labeled data, collected similarly to the Shenma dataset, but specifically for the Amap navigation service.

In this section, the authors also provide a breakdown of the training, validation, and test sets for both datasets, which is crucial for understanding their structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are proprietary and specific to the authors' work, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper itself.

For the **Shenma Voice Search Dataset**, the relevant citation is:
> Xu Tian, Jun Zhang, Zejun Ma, Yi He, Juan Wei, Peihao Wu, Wenchang Situ, Shuai Li, Yang Zhang. *Deep LSTM for Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].

For the **Amap Voice Search Dataset**, the citation is:
> Xu Tian, Jun Zhang, Zejun Ma, Yi He, Juan Wei, Peihao Wu, Wenchang Situ, Shuai Li, Yang Zhang. *Deep LSTM for Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].

Since both datasets are part of the same study, I will use the same citation for both, adjusting the description to reflect the specific dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include all necessary details and citations, ready for structured output or further processing.
