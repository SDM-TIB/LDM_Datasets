To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Image-to-Text and Text-to-Image Synthesis" by Anindya Sundar Das and Sriparna Saha, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of automatic image description and image generation from text, but I need to look for specific dataset names. 

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly where the authors describe their experiments. In **section 4 (Experiment)**, they mention using two publicly available datasets: 

1. **Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset**: This dataset contains a total of 11,788 images of 200 bird species, with multiple annotations per image. The authors specify the split into training and testing sets, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

2. **Oxford-102 Flower Dataset**: This dataset consists of 8,189 images of 102 categories of flowers, also split into training and testing sets.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. 

The citations I need to extract are:

- For **Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*. Technical Report CNS-TR-2011-001 California Institute of Technology.

- For **Oxford-102 Flower Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nilsback, M.-E., & Zisserman, A. (2008). *Automated Flower Classification over a Large Number of Classes*. In Proceedings of the Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics and Image Processing (ICVGIP), 2008.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
