To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning Enhanced Rydberg Multifrequency Microwave Recognition" by Zong-Kai Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will focus on sections that describe the experimental setup and the data used for training and testing the deep learning model. I will pay close attention to any specific names of datasets mentioned, as well as their characteristics, such as size, type, and any relevant details about how they were collected or processed.

In the **Methods section**, I will look for descriptions of how the datasets were generated or obtained. This section may provide insights into the specifics of the datasets, including any preprocessing steps or the nature of the data (e.g., transmission spectra, noise characteristics).

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. I will ensure that I note down the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset called "Rydberg Transmission Spectra," I will look for its citation in the references. If it is not explicitly cited, I will note the details provided in the paper and search for the original source if necessary.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help me create a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will review my findings to ensure accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset entries for further processing or presentation.
