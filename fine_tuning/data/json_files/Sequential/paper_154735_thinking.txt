To extract datasets from the research paper titled "R2D2: Relational Text Decoding with Transformers" by Aryan Arbabi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the introduction, the authors refer to several public datasets used for data-to-text generation tasks, specifically mentioning **WikiBio**, **E2E**, **AGENDA**, and **WebNLG**. This indicates that these datasets are likely important for the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant subsections that provide detailed descriptions of these datasets. In this paper, the authors have included a section labeled **A Dataset details and preparations**, which is crucial for gathering specific information about each dataset.

In this section, I will extract the following details for each dataset:

1. **WikiBio**: 
   - Description: Comprises 728,321 biography-infobox pairs from English Wikipedia, used for generating the first sentence of a biography.
   - Citation: 
     > Rémi Lebret, David Grangier, and Michael Auli. *Neural text generation from structured data with application to the biography domain*. In Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2016.

2. **E2E**: 
   - Description: A crowd-sourced dataset of 50,000 samples in the restaurant domain, used for generating descriptions from structured input.
   - Citation: 
     > Ondřej Dušek, Jekaterina Novikova, and Verena Rieser. *Evaluating the State-of-the-Art of End-to-End Natural Language Generation: The E2E NLG Challenge*. Computer Speech & Language, 2020.

3. **AGENDA**: 
   - Description: Comprises 40,720 scientific abstracts, each supplemented with a title and a matching knowledge graph.
   - Citation: 
     > Rik Koncel-Kedziorski, Dhanush Bekal, Yi Luan, Mirella Lapata, and Hannaneh Hajishirzi. *Text generation from knowledge graphs with graph transformers*. In Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL), 2019.

4. **WebNLG**: 
   - Description: Consists of 25,298 graph-text pairs, where each graph is represented as sets of (head, predicate, tail) tuples.
   - Citation: 
     > Claire Gardent, Anastasia Shimorina, Shashi Narayan, and Laura Perez-Beltrachini. *The WebNLG challenge: Generating text from RDF data*. In International Conference on Natural Language Generation (INLG), 2017.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have the correct formatting for each citation and that I have accurately captured the essence of each dataset as described in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its respective citation.
