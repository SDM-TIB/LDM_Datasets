To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enriched Pre-trained Transformers for Joint Slot Filling and Intent Detection" by Momchil Hardalov et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to "standard datasets" used for evaluation, which indicates that specific datasets are likely discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 3), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they used two publicly available datasets: **ATIS** and **SNIPS**. I will take note of the details provided about each dataset, including their characteristics and statistics.

In the **statistics table (Table 2)**, the authors provide a comparison of the two datasets, including the number of intents, slots, and training samples. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope and application.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **ATIS dataset**, the citation is:
   > Charles T. Hemphill, John J. Godfrey, and George R. Doddington. *The ATIS spoken language systems pilot corpus*. In Speech and Natural Language: Proceedings of a Workshop Held at Hidden Valley, Pennsylvania, June 24-27, 1990.

2. For the **SNIPS dataset**, the citation is:
   > Alexis Coucke, Alaa Saade, Adrien Ball, Théodore Bluche, Alexandre Caulier, David Leroy, Clément Doumouro, Thibault Gisselbrecht, Francesco Caltagirone, Thibaut Lavril, et al. *Snips voice platform: an embedded spoken language understanding system for private-by-design voice interfaces*. arXiv:1805.10190.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **ATIS Dataset**: Contains transcripts from audio recordings of flight information requests, with 21 intents and 120 slot categories.
- **SNIPS Dataset**: Collected by a custom intent engine for personal voice assistants, covering various subjects with 7 intents and 72 slots.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
