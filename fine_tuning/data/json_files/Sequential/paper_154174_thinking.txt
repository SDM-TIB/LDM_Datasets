To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Matrix Profile XXII: Exact Discovery of Time Series Motifs under DTW" by Sara Alaee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to look for specific datasets that the authors have used in their experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of time series motif discovery and mention that their method can be applied to various domains, but they do not specify datasets yet. I will need to continue searching through the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** (Section V), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they have built a webpage containing all datasets, code, and random number seeds used in their work, which is a good indication that datasets are included.

I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in this section. The authors refer to examples of DTW motifs discovered in various datasets, including an electrical penetration graph (EPG) dataset used to study insect behavior. However, they do not provide a detailed description or citation for this dataset in the text.

To find the full citation for the datasets, I will check the **References section**. The authors reference several works that may contain the datasets they used. For instance, they mention a study on insect feeding behavior by D.S. Willet et al. (2016), which could be related to the EPG dataset.

The relevant citation from the references is:
- D.S. Willet, et al. (2016). "Machine learning for characterization of insect vector feeding." *PLoS Computational Biology*, 12(11).

Additionally, the authors mention that all datasets used in their experiments are available on their supporting webpage. I will note this as it may provide further details on the datasets.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format for clarity. The key dataset I found is the EPG dataset related to insect behavior, along with its citation.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations for future reference or processing.
