To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "MCGKT-Net: Multi-level Context Gating Knowledge Transfer Network for Single Image Deraining" by Kohei Yamamichi and Xian-Hua Han, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that they conducted experiments on **three benchmark datasets: Rain100H, Rain100L, and Rain800**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. They mention:

1. **Rain100H**: This dataset consists of 1800 rainy/clean image pairs for training and 200 pairs for testing, with images synthesized using five different directions of rain streaks.

2. **Rain100L**: Similar to Rain100H, this dataset has 1800 training images and 200 test images, but the rainy images are synthesized with only one type of rain streak.

3. **Rain800**: This dataset contains a total of 800 images, with 700 rainy/clean pairs for training and the remaining for testing. The rainy images are created by adding rain streaks to clean images with various intensities and orientations.

The authors also provide visual examples of the datasets, which further confirms their significance in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Rain100H** and **Rain100L**, the citation is:
  > Yang, W., Tan, R. T., Feng, J., Liu, J., Guo, Z., & Yan, S. (2017). Deep joint rain detection and removal from a single image. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1357–1366.

- For **Rain800**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, H., Sindagi, V., & Patel, V. M. (2018). Density-aware single image deraining using a multi-stream dense network. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 695–704.

With these citations, I can now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
