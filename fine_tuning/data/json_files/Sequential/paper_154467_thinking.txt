To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning with Function Properties in Mean Reversion Strategies" by Sophia Gu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to look for specific references to datasets in the context of the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (section 5), where the author discusses the use of simulated stochastic price processes for training and testing the deep reinforcement learning models. Here, the author mentions two specific processes: the **Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process** and the **ARMA(2,1) process**. These processes are used as datasets for the experiments, but I need to ensure I capture their details accurately.

In the **results section**, the author presents the performance metrics of the models trained on these processes, which further confirms their use as datasets. However, I need to ensure that I also find the full citations for any original sources or foundational papers that describe these processes, as they are essential for proper attribution.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the foundational papers related to the OU process and ARMA processes:

1. For the **Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process**, I will reference:
   > H. E. Hurst, "Long-term storage capacity of reservoirs," *Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers*, vol. 116, pp. 770-799, 1951.

2. For the **ARMA(2,1) process**, I will reference:
   > G. E. P. Box and G. M. Jenkins, *Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control*, 3rd ed. Prentice Hall, 1994.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
