To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sleep syndromes onset detection based on automatic sleep staging algorithm" by Tim Cvetko and Tinkara Robek, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used the **PhysioNet Sleep European Data Format (EDF) Database** for their study, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experimental results** sections, as these often contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In **section 4.1 (Data)**, the authors provide a comprehensive description of the **PhysioNet Sleep-EDF dataset**. They mention that it contains 197 whole-night polysomnographic sleep recordings, including EEG, EOG, chin EMG, and event markers, which confirms its relevance to their research.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the **PhysioNet Sleep-EDF dataset** from the **References section**. The citation is not explicitly provided in the text, so I will need to refer to the PhysioNet website or relevant literature to find the appropriate citation. 

The citation for the **PhysioNet Sleep-EDF dataset** is:
> PhysioNet. *Sleep-EDF Database*. Available at: https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/sleep-edf/

Since the dataset is widely recognized and used in sleep research, this citation is sufficient for referencing it in my dataset extraction.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
