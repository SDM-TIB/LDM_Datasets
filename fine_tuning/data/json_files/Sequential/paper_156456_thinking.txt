To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bird Movement Prediction Using Long Short-Term Memory Networks to Prevent Bird Strikes with Low Altitude Aircraft" by Elaheh Sabziyan Varnousfaderani and Syed A. M. Shihab, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that a publicly available dataset on the movement of pigeons is utilized, which suggests that there is a specific dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **methodology section**. The authors mention that the dataset consists of latitudes and longitudes of pigeons and that it is publicly available on MoveBank. They specify that the dataset includes 14,400 data points, each corresponding to one second over a four-hour period. This is crucial information for describing the dataset.

I will also check the **results section** to confirm that the dataset is indeed used for training and testing the models, which will further validate its importance in the research.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference MoveBank as the source of the dataset, which is a key detail.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> MoveBank. “Data,” 2022. URL https://www.movebank.org/cms/movebank-main, accessed 10 April 2023.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entry. The dataset is the movement data of pigeons, which is critical for the research on bird movement prediction.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry according to the required format, ensuring that I include the full citation as it is essential for proper attribution and reference.
