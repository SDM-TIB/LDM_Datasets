To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning from Training Dynamics: Identifying Mislabeled Data" by Qingrui Jia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments using various datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges posed by mislabeled data and the need for effective identification methods. They mention that their method was evaluated on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be listed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. They specifically mention:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 color images across 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images.
3. **CUB-200-2011**: A fine-grained dataset with 11,788 images of 200 bird species.
4. **Caltech-256**: A dataset containing images from 256 categories, with more than 80 images in each category.
5. **Tiny ImageNet**: A subset of ImageNet, containing images resized to 64x64 pixels.
6. **WebVision**: A dataset containing images sourced from the web, known for its label noise.
7. **Clothing1M**: A dataset with 1 million images of clothing items, also known for label noise.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. [Link to dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of CVPR.

- For **WebVision**:

- For **Clothing1M**:
  > Xiao, T., Xia, T., Yang, Y., Huang, C., & Wang, X. (2015). *Learning from massive noisy labeled data for image classification*. In Proceedings of CVPR.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
