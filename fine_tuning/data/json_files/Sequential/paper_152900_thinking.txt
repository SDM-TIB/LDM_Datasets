To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Time Series Momentum Strategies Using Deep Neural Networks" by Bryan Lim, Stefan Zohren, and Stephen Roberts, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses backtesting on a portfolio of 88 continuous futures contracts, which suggests that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more specific details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors provide a detailed breakdown of the dataset in the **Appendix**. They mention that they extracted 88 continuous futures contracts from the Pinnacle Data Corp CLC Database, which is crucial information.

I will summarize the dataset details as follows:

1. **Continuous Futures Contracts Dataset**: This dataset consists of 88 ratio-adjusted continuous futures contracts covering various asset classes, including commodities, fixed income, and foreign exchange. The data spans from 1990 to 2015 and includes prices for each contract.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The dataset is derived from the Pinnacle Data Corp CLC Database, but since it is a proprietary database, it may not have a formal citation like academic papers. However, I will note the source as follows:

- **Pinnacle Data Corp CLC Database**: Pinnacle Data Corp. CLC Database. Available at: https://pinnacledata2.com/clc.html.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset source. This will allow for proper referencing in any future work or analysis.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in a structured format for easy access and review.
