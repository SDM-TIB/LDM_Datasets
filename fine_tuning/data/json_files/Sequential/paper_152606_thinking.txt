To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ainâ€™t Nobody Got Time for Coding: Structure-Aware Program Synthesis from Natural Language" by Jakub Bednarek, Karol Piaskowski, and Krzysztof Krawiec, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for training or evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Program Synthesis Tasks)**, where the authors describe the specific tasks and datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention the use of a dataset proposed in a previous study by Polosukhin and Skidanov (2018), which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

In this section, the authors detail the dataset, which consists of 99,506 examples of natural language specifications paired with corresponding AlgoLisp programs. They also mention how the dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets, which is important for understanding the dataset's structure.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The relevant citation for the dataset is:

- For the dataset used in the experiments, the citation is:
  > Illia Polosukhin and Alex Skidanov. *Neural Program Search: Solving Programming Tasks from Description and Examples*. 2018.

Now, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **AlgoLisp Dataset**: This dataset comprises 99,506 examples, each consisting of a natural language specification and the corresponding AlgoLisp program. The dataset is split into a training set (79,214 examples), a validation set (9,352 examples), and a test set (10,940 examples). The average lengths of the natural language specifications and the associated code are 38 and 24 tokens, respectively.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
