To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Enhanced Seq2Seq Autoencoder via Contrastive Learning for Abstractive Text Summarization" by Chujie Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that they conduct experiments on **two datasets**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 5)**, where the authors specifically mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that they evaluate their model using **two popular summarization datasets**: the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset** and the **extreme summarization dataset (XSUM)**. This confirms the names of the datasets I need to extract.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

1. For the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset**, the citation is:
   > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomas Kocisky, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend*. Advances in neural information processing systems, 28:1693–1701, 2015.

2. For the **XSUM dataset**, the citation is:
   > Shashi Narayan, Shay B Cohen, and Mirella Lapata. *Don’t give me the details, just the summary! Topic-aware convolutional neural networks for extreme summarization*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1797–1807, Brussels, Belgium. Association for Computational Linguistics.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are ready for review or further processing.
