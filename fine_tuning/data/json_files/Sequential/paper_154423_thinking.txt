To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Morphology Matters: A Multilingual Language Modeling Analysis" by Hyunji Hayley Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract indicates that the authors compiled a larger corpus of **145 Bible translations in 92 languages**. This suggests that the Bible translations are a primary dataset used in their analysis.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly the **Methods** and **Data** sections. In **section 4.1 (Data)**, the authors provide a comprehensive description of the dataset:

1. **Bible Translations Dataset**: This dataset consists of **145 Bible translations** across **92 languages**, which are fully aligned at the verse level. The majority of the data comes from Mielke et al. (2019) and Mayer and Cysouw (2014), with additional Bibles sourced from Christodoulopoulos and Steedman (2014) and various online resources.

In the **References section**, I will need to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Bible corpus** used in the study, the citation is:
  > Thomas Mayer and Michael Cysouw. *Creating a massively parallel Bible corpus*. In Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2014), pages 3158–3163, Reykjavik, Iceland. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

- For the additional Bible translations sourced from Christodoulopoulos and Steedman, the citation is:
  > Christos Christodoulopoulos and Mark Steedman. *A massively parallel corpus: The Bible in 100 languages*. Language Resources and Evaluation, 49:1–21, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are accurately recorded.
