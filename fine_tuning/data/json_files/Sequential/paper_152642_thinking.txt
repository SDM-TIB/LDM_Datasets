To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Speaker-Adaptive Neural Vocoders for Parametric Speech Synthesis Systems" by Eunwoo Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a "ten minutesâ€™ speech corpus for training the model," which indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more specific details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that detail the experimental setup and the datasets used. In the **Experimental setup** subsection, the authors mention that they used speech corpora recorded by Korean male and female speakers. They provide a breakdown of the number of utterances in different sets for these speakers, which suggests that there are specific datasets being utilized.

I will note the following datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **Korean Male Speaker Dataset (KRM)**: This dataset consists of 55 training utterances (10 minutes), 25 development utterances (5 minutes), and 80 test utterances (15 minutes).
2. **Korean Female Speaker Dataset (KRF)**: This dataset consists of 90 training utterances (10 minutes), 40 development utterances (5 minutes), and 130 test utterances (15 minutes).

Now, I will look for full citations for these datasets in the **References section**. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for these datasets, as they appear to be original datasets created by the authors for their experiments. Therefore, I will document them as such, indicating that they are proprietary datasets used in this study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the context of their use in the experiments and the details provided in the paper. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets utilized in the research.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
