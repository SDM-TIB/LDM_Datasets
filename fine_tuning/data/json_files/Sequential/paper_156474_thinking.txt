To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Airport service quality perception and flight delays: examining the influence of psychosituational latent traits of respondents in passenger satisfaction surveys" by Alessandro V. M. Oliveira, Bruno F. Oliveira, and Moisés D. Vassallo, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study is based on a survey conducted at São Paulo GRU Airport, which suggests that there is a dataset related to passenger satisfaction.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. The authors describe the **Passenger Satisfaction Survey (PS Survey)** as the main data source, which contains 13,071 questionnaires collected from passengers at GRU Airport between February 21, 2018, and July 21, 2021. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

In addition, I will check the **appendices** for any supplementary datasets or detailed descriptions. The appendix provides a detailed description of the variables used in the study, which further confirms the existence of the PS Survey dataset and its structure.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Passenger Satisfaction Survey (PS Survey)**: 
   > National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC). *Passenger Satisfaction Survey of São Paulo/Guarulhos – Governor André Franco Montoro International Airport*. Available at: www.nectar.ita.br/avstats/studies_reports.html.

2. **Air Transport Statistical Database, Microdata (ATSD-M)**:

3. **Active Scheduled Flight Historical Data Series (VRA)**:

4. **Iowa State University Mesonet**: 
   > Iowa State University. *Iowa State University Mesonet Weather Data*. Available at: mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/ASOS.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its citation for future reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the data sources used in the research paper.
