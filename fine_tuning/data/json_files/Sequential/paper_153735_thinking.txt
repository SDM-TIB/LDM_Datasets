To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tiny Eats: Eating Detection on a Microcontroller" by Maria T. Nyamukuru and Koﬁ M. Odame, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the implementation of a neural network for dietary monitoring, which suggests that data collection is involved, but I need to find specific dataset details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional food diaries and the need for automated dietary monitoring systems. This context indicates that they likely used a dataset for their experiments, but I need to find explicit mentions of it.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors describe the **Eating Detection Dataset**. They mention that the data was collected from 20 participants using a contact microphone, detailing the types of activities recorded (eating and non-eating) and the duration of the dataset. This section provides crucial information about the dataset's structure and purpose.

The authors also reference a previous study in this section, which indicates that the dataset has been used in prior research. I will need to find the citation for this dataset in the **References section**.

In the **References section**, I will look for the citation related to the dataset collection. The authors cite a work by Bi et al. (2017) that discusses a wearable sensor for detecting eating episodes. The full citation is:
> S. Bi, T. Wang, E. Davenport, R. Peterson, R. Halter, J. Sorber, and D. Kotz, “Toward a wearable sensor for eating detection,” in Proceedings of the 2017 Workshop on Wearable Systems and Applications, ser. WearSys 17. New York, NY, USA: Association for Computing Machinery, 2017, p. 17-22. [Online]. Available: https://doi.org/10.1145/3089351.3089355

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Eating Detection Dataset**: Collected from 20 participants using a contact microphone to capture eating and non-eating activities. The dataset includes a total of 4 hours of eating data and 7 hours of non-eating data, segmented into 4-second windows for analysis.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included for proper attribution.
