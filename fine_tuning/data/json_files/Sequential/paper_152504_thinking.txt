To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "Exploiting Rich Syntactic Information for Semantic Parsing with Graph-to-Sequence Model" by Kun Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their model on benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention three datasets: **Jobs640**, **Geo880**, and **ATIS**. I will take note of the descriptions provided for each dataset, including the number of queries and the context in which they are used.

1. **Jobs640**: This dataset consists of 640 queries related to a database of job listings. The authors mention that it is used to evaluate the performance of their model in the context of semantic parsing.

2. **Geo880**: This dataset contains 880 queries directed at a database of U.S. geography. Similar to Jobs640, it serves as a benchmark for assessing the model's capabilities.

3. **ATIS**: The ATIS dataset includes 5,410 queries for a flight booking system. This dataset is well-known in the field of semantic parsing and is used to evaluate the model's performance on more complex queries.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
