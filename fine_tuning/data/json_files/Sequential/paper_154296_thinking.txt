To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Any-to-One Sequence-to-Sequence Voice Conversion Using Self-Supervised Discrete Speech Representations" by Wen-Chin Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a novel approach to voice conversion but does not specify datasets. The introduction discusses voice conversion methods but does not provide dataset details either.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Settings)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **CMU ARCTIC Database**: This dataset contains parallel recordings of professional US English speakers sampled at 16 kHz. The authors specify that they used recordings from a male speaker (rms) and a female speaker (slt) for training.

2. **LibriSpeech Dataset**: This dataset is used for pretraining the VQW2V model and consists of 960 hours of audio from public domain audiobooks.

3. **M-AILABS Speech Dataset**: This dataset is used for TTS pretraining and contains 15,200 audiobook recordings, totaling approximately 32 hours of audio.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **CMU ARCTIC Database**, the citation is:
  > J. Kominek and A. W Black, “The CMU ARCTIC speech databases,” in Fifth ISCA Workshop on Speech Synthesis, 2004.

- For the **LibriSpeech Dataset**, the citation is:
  > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur, “LibriSpeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books,” in Proc. ICASSP, 2015, pp. 5206–5210.

- For the **M-AILABS Speech Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Munich Artificial Intelligence Laboratories GmbH, “The M-AILABS speech dataset,” 2019, accessed 30 November 2019.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
