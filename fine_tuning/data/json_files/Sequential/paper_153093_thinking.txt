To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Text Repetitions and Denoising Autoencoders in OCR Post-correction" by Kai Hakala et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on a manually corrected corpus of Finnish newspapers, which suggests that there is a specific dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Data)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their study:

1. **National Library of Finland (NLF) Corpus**: This dataset consists of approximately three million scanned issues of newspapers and journals from 1771 to 1910. The authors mention that this corpus has been OCR read and includes 479 manually corrected issues sampled from the original data. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

2. **Gutenberg Project Corpus**: The authors utilize Finnish literature from the Gutenberg Project, which is a collection of various texts. They specifically mention that they sample 1.5 million tokens from this corpus for training purposes.

3. **Kotus Corpus**: This dataset is provided by the Institute for the Languages of Finland and focuses on Finnish newspapers from 1809 to 1899. The authors use a subset of this corpus that shares the style and vocabulary of the NLF data.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations:

- For the **National Library of Finland Corpus**, the citation is:
  > National Library of Finland. *Publicly available collection of scanned issues of newspapers and journals*. Available at: https://www.kansalliskirjasto.fi/

- For the **Gutenberg Project Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Project Gutenberg. *A collection of free eBooks*. Retrieved February 2018, from www.gutenberg.org.

- For the **Kotus Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Institute for the Languages of Finland (Kotus). *Early Modern Finnish Corpus*. Available at: http://kaino.kotus.fi/korpus/1800/meta/1800_coll_rdf.xml.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the study along with their proper citations.
