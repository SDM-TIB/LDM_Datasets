To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Knowledge-Grounded Dialog System Based on Pre-Trained Language Models" by Weijie Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a knowledge-grounded dialog system for the DSTC9 challenge, which suggests that datasets related to dialog systems may be involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference the **MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset** as a previous task-oriented dialog dataset. This indicates that this dataset is likely relevant to their work. I will note this down for further exploration.

Next, I will focus on the **dataset section** of the paper, where the authors provide specific details about the dataset used for training and evaluation. They mention that the dataset encompasses conversations providing tourist information about hotels, restaurants, taxis, etc. They also provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of user turns for training, validation, and testing, as well as the number of knowledge-seeking turns.

The paper explicitly states that the dataset used is an **augmented version of MultiWOZ 2.1**, which includes additional turns requiring answers grounded on external unstructured knowledge. This is crucial information that confirms the dataset's relevance.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the **MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Budzianowski, P., Wen, T.-H., Tseng, B.-H., Casanueva, I., Ultes, S., Ramadan, O., & Gaˇsi´c, M. (2018). MultiWOZ - A large-scale multi-domain wizard-of-oz dataset for task-oriented dialogue modelling. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.00278.

Additionally, I will note that the paper mentions the **DSTC9 Track 1** challenge, which is relevant to the dataset's context but does not constitute a dataset itself.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset** as it is the primary dataset referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and completeness.
