To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint User Pairing and Association for Multicell NOMA: A Pointer Network-based Approach" by Manyou Ma and Vincent W.S. Wong, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the introduction and methodology sections, where the authors are likely to discuss the datasets used for simulations or experiments.

Next, I will look for any **specific mentions of datasets** in the text. In this paper, the authors describe a simulation environment, but they do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets. Instead, they describe the parameters and configurations used in their simulations, such as the number of users, base stations, and the network area.

Since there are no specific datasets referenced in the paper, I will check the **References section** for any citations that might relate to datasets or methodologies that could imply the use of datasets. However, the references primarily cite foundational works and methodologies rather than specific datasets.

Given that the paper does not provide explicit datasets, I will note that the authors conducted simulations based on a defined network model rather than using external datasets. Therefore, I will summarize the simulation parameters instead of providing dataset citations.

In conclusion, I will compile my findings, noting that while the paper discusses simulation results, it does not reference any specific datasets. I will ensure to document this clearly, as it is important for understanding the context of the research and the absence of external datasets.
