To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning and Linear Programming for Automated Ensemble Forecasting and Interpretation" by Lars Lien Ankile and Kjartan Krange, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions strong results on the **M4 Competition dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is significant for the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss their contributions and the context of their work, including references to the M4 Competition, which is a well-known dataset for time series forecasting.

In the **methods section**, I will pay close attention to any subsections that explicitly mention datasets. The authors describe their approach and the models they used, and they reference the M4 dataset multiple times, indicating its importance in their experiments.

I will also check the **results section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors provide more context about the M4 dataset's characteristics or any other datasets they might have used.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the M4 Competition dataset. The M4 Competition is widely recognized, and its citation is likely to be included in the references.

Based on my findings, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation for the M4 Competition dataset, which is crucial for proper attribution.

The citation for the M4 Competition dataset is:
> Spyros Makridakis, Evangelos Spiliotis, and Vassilios Assimakopoulos. *The M4 Competition: Results, Findings, Conclusion and Way Forward*. International Journal of Forecasting, 34(4):802â€“808, 2018.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information in a structured format, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or processing.
