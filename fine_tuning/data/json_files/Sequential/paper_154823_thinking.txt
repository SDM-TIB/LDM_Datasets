To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deformation Driven Seq2Seq Longitudinal Tumor and Organs-at-Risk Prediction for Radiotherapy" by Donghoon Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validated their model on two radiotherapy datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the use of a publicly available head-and-neck dataset and an internal lung cancer dataset. This is a good indication that I should look for more detailed descriptions in the methods section.

In the **Materials & Methods section**, I will specifically look for the subsection that describes the datasets. The authors provide details about two datasets:

1. **Head-and-Neck Dataset**: This dataset consists of 28 patients with three-dimensional high-resolution CT scans collected at three timepoints (pre-, mid-, and post-treatment). The dataset is publicly available via The Cancer Image Archive (TCIA).

2. **Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Dataset**: This internal dataset includes 63 patients with planning CT and six weekly cone-beam CT (CBCT) scans. The authors mention that all timepoints were contoured by expert radiation oncologists.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Head-and-Neck Dataset**, the citation is:
> Bejarano, T., De Ornelas-Couto, M., & Mihaylov, I. B. (2019). Longitudinal fan-beam computed tomography dataset for head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma patients. *Medical Physics*, 46(6), 2526-2537.

For the **Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Dataset**, the citation is:
> Alam, S., Zhang, P., Rimner, A., Sonke, J.-J., Deasy, J. O., & Tannenbaum, A. (2020). Quantification of accumulated dose and associated anatomical changes of esophagus using weekly Magnetic Resonance Imaging acquired during radiotherapy of locally advanced lung cancer. *Physics and Imaging in Radiation Oncology*, 13, 36-43.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the study along with their proper citations.
