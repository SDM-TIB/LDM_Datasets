To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A CNN-BiLSTM Model with Attention Mechanism for Earthquake Prediction" by Parisa Kavianpour et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a novel prediction method based on historical earthquake data, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **data preprocessing section** where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that the earthquake catalog consists of 11,442 cases with a magnitude greater than or equal to 3.5, recorded from January 15, 1966, to May 22, 2021. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

In the **dataset and data preprocessing section**, the authors specify that the data was obtained from the US Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Seismological Center (NSC) websites. This is crucial information for citation purposes.

Now, I will compile the details of the dataset:

1. **Earthquake Catalog Dataset**: This dataset includes vital information such as latitude, longitude, time of earthquakes, magnitude, and depth of earthquakes. The dataset spans from January 15, 1966, to May 22, 2021, and contains 11,442 records.

Next, I will look for the full citation for the dataset. Since the authors mention that the data is sourced from the USGS and NSC, I will reference these organizations as follows:

- For the **Earthquake Catalog Dataset**, the citation is:
  > U.S. Geological Survey. "Earthquake Catalog." Available at: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/ (Accessed: [insert access date]).

- For the **National Seismological Center**, the citation is:
  > National Seismological Center. "Earthquake Data." Available at: [insert URL] (Accessed: [insert access date]).

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset details and citations before compiling them into a structured format for further use. This systematic approach will help ensure that I do not miss any critical information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
