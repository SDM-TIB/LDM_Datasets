To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LSTMs Compose—and Learn—Bottom-Up" by Naomi Saphra and Adam Lopez, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any mention of datasets used in the experiments. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section** and any subsequent sections that detail the experiments conducted. In this paper, the authors mention using **wikitext-2** and the **Universal Dependencies corpus English-EWT** for their experiments. I will note these datasets as they are explicitly mentioned in the context of the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For the **wikitext-2 dataset**, I will look for its citation, which is typically associated with the original paper that introduced or described the dataset. The citation for wikitext-2 is:
> Stephen Merity, Caiming Xiong, James Bradbury, and Richard Socher. *Pointer sentinel mixture models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.07843, 2016.

For the **Universal Dependencies corpus**, I will find its citation as well. The citation is:
> Natalia Silveira, Timothy Dozat, Marie-Catherine de Marneffe, Samuel Bowman, Miriam Connor, John Bauer, and Christopher D. Manning. *A gold standard dependency corpus for English*. In Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC-2014), 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its full citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for future reference.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets from the paper:
1. **wikitext-2**: Citation as provided above.
2. **Universal Dependencies corpus English-EWT**: Citation as provided above.

With this information, I will be ready to format the dataset entries appropriately for any required output or documentation.
