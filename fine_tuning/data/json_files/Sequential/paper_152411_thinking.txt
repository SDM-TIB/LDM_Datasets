To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Auto-Meta: Automated Gradient Based Meta Learner Search" by Jaehong Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved state-of-the-art results on the **5-shot 5-way Mini-ImageNet classification problem**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors discuss their evaluation methodology. In **section 4.1 (Few Shot Image Classification)**, they explicitly mention using two benchmark datasets:

1. **Omniglot Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,623 handwritten characters from 50 different alphabets, which is commonly used for few-shot learning tasks.

2. **Mini-ImageNet Dataset**: This dataset contains 60,000 images (84Ã—84 pixels) across 100 classes, and it is widely used for evaluating few-shot learning algorithms.

The authors provide details about how these datasets were utilized in their experiments, confirming their relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Omniglot Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lake, B. M., Salakhutdinov, R., & Tenenbaum, J. B. (2015). Human-level concept learning through probabilistic program induction. *Science*, 350(6266), 1332-1338.

- For the **Mini-ImageNet Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T., Kavukcuoglu, K., & Wierstra, D. (2016). Matching networks for one shot learning. In *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 29* (pp. 3630-3638).

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
