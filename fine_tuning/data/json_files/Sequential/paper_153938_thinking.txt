To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Predictive Power of Neural Language Models for Human Real-Time Comprehension Behavior" by Ethan G. Wilcox et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the relationship between language models and human reading behavior, but they do not specify datasets yet. I will continue to the **methods section**, where they describe the models and the data used for training and evaluation.

In the **methods section**, the authors mention three specific datasets used for evaluating the models' psychometric predictive power:

1. **Dundee Eye-Tracking Corpus**: This dataset is referenced as being used for eye-tracking data to assess gaze duration during reading. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Kennedy, A. (2003). *The Dundee Corpus* [cd-rom]. Psychology Department, University of Dundee.

2. **Brown Corpus**: The authors mention using selections from the Brown corpus for self-paced reading data. The citation for this corpus is:
   > Charniak, E., Blaheta, D., Ge, N., Hall, K., Hale, J., & Johnson, M. (2000). *BLLIP 1987â€“89 WSJ corpus release 1*. Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia.

3. **Natural Stories Corpus**: This corpus is explicitly designed for self-paced reading times and includes syntactic constructions that are relatively rare. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Futrell, R., Gibson, E., Tily, H., Blank, I., Vishnevetsky, A., & Piantadosi, S. T. (2017). *The Natural Stories Corpus*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.05763.

Next, I will verify these datasets by checking the **results section** to ensure they are indeed the datasets used for the experiments. The authors confirm that they evaluated their models on the Dundee eye-tracking corpus, selections from the Brown corpus, and the Natural Stories corpus, which aligns with what I found in the methods section.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information for structured output, ready for further processing or review.
