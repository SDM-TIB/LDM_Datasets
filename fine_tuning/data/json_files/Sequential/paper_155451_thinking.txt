To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting vacant parking space availability zone-wisely: a graph based spatio-temporal prediction approach" by Yajing Feng, Qian Hu, and Zhenzhou Tang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses predicting vacant parking space (VPS) availability, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to parking spaces.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of VPS prediction and mention that they utilize real parking data from 8 parking lots in Santa Monica. This is a strong indication that a dataset is involved, but I need to find more specific details.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsection titled "Data description & preprocessing." Here, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset, stating that it comes from 8 parking lots (St1-St8) in Santa Monica, California, with a total of 9108 recorded data points per lot. They also mention the data collection frequency (every 5 minutes) and the time range for data collection (from 05/11/2018 7:00 to 06/11/2018 23:55). This section confirms the existence of a dataset and provides key details about it.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference their previous work, which may contain the dataset or its details. However, since the dataset is derived from real-world data, it may not have a formal citation like other datasets.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Santa Monica Parking Dataset
   - **Description**: Contains real parking data from 8 public parking lots (St1-St8) in Santa Monica, California, with a total of 9108 recorded data points per lot. The data was collected every 5 minutes from 05/11/2018 7:00 to 06/11/2018 23:55.
   - **Citation**: The dataset is referenced in the paper but does not have a formal citation. However, the authors' previous works can be cited for context:
     > Y. Feng, Z. Tang, Y. Xu, S. Krishnamoorthy, and Q. Hu. "Predicting vacant parking space availability zone-wisely: a densely connected ConvLSTM method." In 2021 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference (VPPC), pp. 1â€“6, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
