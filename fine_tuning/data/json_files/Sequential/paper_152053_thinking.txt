To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Enterprise to Computer: Star Trek chatbot" by Grishma Jena et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the creation of a chatbot that incorporates Star Trek dialog style, which suggests that datasets related to Star Trek dialogs are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for training their models. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Star Trek Dataset**: This dataset is created from various Star Trek T.V. episodes and movies, consisting of 100,990 post-response pairs with an average utterance length of 14.3 words. The authors reference a GitHub repository for initial cleaning and mention a method for generating post-response pairs.

2. **Cornell Movie-Dialog Corpus**: This dataset, created by Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil and Lee (2011), contains 199,455 post-response pairs with an average utterance length of 12.82 words. It is used to train the SEQ2SEQ component for general conversations.

3. **Tweets**: An open-source Twitter dataset mentioned by Ma (2017), which includes 50,000 post-response tweet pairs with an average utterance length of 16.18 words. This dataset is used to train a binary classifier for predicting non-Star Trek style inputs.

I will now check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Star Trek Dataset**, since it is created by the authors and does not have a formal citation, I will note it as:
  > Star Trek Dialogs. n.d. Star trek dialogs. Accessed: 2017-04-22. http://www.chakoteya.net/StarTrek/.

- For the **Cornell Movie-Dialog Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil and Lillian Lee. 2011. Chameleons in imagined conversations: A new approach to understanding coordination of linguistic style in dialogs. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics, ACL 2011.

- For the **Tweets dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marsan Ma. 2017. Twitter dataset. Accessed: 2017-04-22. https://github.com/Marsan-Ma/chat corpus.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
