To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Grained Spatio-Temporal Modeling for Lip-Reading" by Chenhao Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on "two challenging word-level lip-reading benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved. I will note this as a starting point for further investigation.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the author typically describes the datasets used for evaluation. This section is likely to provide detailed information about the datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics.

In **subsection 4.1**, the author explicitly mentions two datasets:

1. **Lip Reading in the Wild (LRW)**: This dataset consists of short segments from BBC programs, with a total duration of 173 hours and includes 500 words. It is noted for its challenges due to variations in speakers and conditions.

2. **LRW-1000**: This dataset is described as a Mandarin lip-reading dataset with 1000 word classes and 718,018 samples, totaling 57 hours. It also highlights the variations in scale, resolution, and speaker attributes.

After identifying the datasets, I will proceed to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **Lip Reading in the Wild (LRW)**, the citation is:
  > Joon Son Chung and Andrew Zisserman. *Lip reading in the wild*. In Asian Conference on Computer Vision, pages 87–103. Springer, 2016.

- For **LRW-1000**, the citation is:
  > Shuang Yang, Yuanhang Zhang, Dalu Feng, Mingmin Yang, Chenhao Wang, Jingyun Xiao, Keyu Long, Shiguang Shan, and Xilin Chen. *LRW-1000: A naturally-distributed large-scale benchmark for lip reading in the wild*. In 2019 14th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition (FG 2019), pages 1–8. IEEE, 2019.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as required.
