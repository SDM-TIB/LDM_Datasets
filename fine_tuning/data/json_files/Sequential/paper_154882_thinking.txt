To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Forecasting Thermoacoustic Instabilities in Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines Using Multimodal Bayesian Deep Learning" by Ushnish Sengupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors use data from experimental campaigns on the BKD combustor, which suggests that there is a specific dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors describe the BKD combustor and the data collected during the experiments. They mention that the dataset is derived from experiments performed on the BKD combustor operated at the DLR Institute of Space Propulsion. This section provides crucial details about the nature of the data collected, including sensor measurements such as injector pressure, temperature, static chamber pressure, dynamic pressure measurements, and OH* chemiluminescence measurements.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their models based on the dataset derived from five experimental runs. They specify that the dataset consists of time series data from these runs, which include instances of thermoacoustic instability. This confirms the dataset's relevance to their study.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the BKD combustor dataset. The authors reference several papers related to the BKD combustor, including:

1. For the BKD combustor experimental setup:
   > D. Suslov, A. Woschnak, J. Sender, M. Oschwald, O. Haidn. *Test specimen design and measurement technique for investigation of heat transfer processes in cooling channels of rocket engines under real thermal conditions*. In: 39th AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference and Exhibit, 2003, p. 4613.

2. For operational experience with the L42 technology demonstrator:
   > J. Sender, D. Suslov, J. Deeken, S. Grönig, M. Oschwald. *L42 technology demonstrator: Operational experience*. In: Space Propulsion 2016, 2016.

3. For the P8 test facility:
   > K. Fröhlke, A. Haberzettl, O. Haidn, S. Heinrich, M. Sion, P. Vuillermoz, K. Froehlke, A. Haberzettl, O. Haidn, S. Heinrich, et al. *First hot fire test campaign at the french/german research facility p8*. In: 33rd Joint Propulsion Conference and Exhibit, 1997, p. 2929.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, ready for further processing or review.
