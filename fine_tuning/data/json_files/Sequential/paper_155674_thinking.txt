To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A case study of spatiotemporal forecasting techniques for weather forecasting" by Shakir Showkat Sofía and Ivan Oseledetsa, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors used the **NASA POWER meteorological dataset** to evaluate their models, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of the dataset in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors describe the NASA POWER dataset as a global database of regular weather data with a spatial resolution of 0.5°x0.5° and a temporal resolution of one day. They collected maximum temperature time series (TMAX) from various latitude-longitude coordinates between October 30, 2015, and November 15, 2020, containing approximately 1844 timestamps at each coordinate point.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the NASA POWER dataset. The authors mention the dataset's source, which is the NASA POWER website. The citation for the dataset is as follows:

> NASA Langley Research Center. *NASA POWER Data Access Viewer*. Available at: https://power.larc.nasa.gov (Accessed: [insert access date]).

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the NASA POWER dataset.

In summary, the key steps I took include:
1. Identifying the dataset in the abstract and introduction.
2. Gathering detailed information about the dataset in the experiments section.
3. Retrieving the full citation from the references.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant details about the dataset used in the research paper.
