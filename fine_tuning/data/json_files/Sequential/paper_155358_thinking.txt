To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Academic Resource Text Level Multi-label Classification based on Attention" by Yue Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experimental results section (Section 4)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Paper Dataset**: This dataset contains 70,829 papers, which include title, abstract, keyword fields, and the corresponding CLC hierarchical label structure. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets in a 3:1:1 ratio.

2. **Patent Dataset**: This dataset consists of 23,123 patents, which include title and abstract but lack keyword fields. The hierarchical labels are based on the International Patent Classification, and like the paper dataset, it is also divided into training, validation, and test sets in a 3:1:1 ratio.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the datasets are not attributed to specific papers or sources in the references, as they are likely original datasets created or compiled by the authors for the purpose of this study.

Since the datasets are described in detail within the paper itself, I will summarize the key characteristics of each dataset without needing external citations.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include all relevant details such as the number of instances, structure, and any specific characteristics that define each dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for any downstream processing or review.
