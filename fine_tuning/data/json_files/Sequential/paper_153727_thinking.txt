To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Neural Architecture Search for Single Image Super-Resolution" by Yong Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section III) where the authors explicitly state that they use the **DIV2K dataset** for training and conduct comparisons on five benchmark datasets: **Set5, Set14, BSD100, Urban100, and Manga109**. This section provides a clear list of datasets utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will gather detailed information about each dataset from the paper and the references section to ensure I can provide full citations:

1. **DIV2K Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as the training dataset. The citation for this dataset is:
   > R. Timofte, E. Agustsson, L. Van Gool, M.-H. Yang, and L. Zhang. *NTIRE 2017 challenge on single image super-resolution: Methods and results*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, pages 114–125, 2017.

2. **Set5 Dataset**: This dataset is used as a validation set. The citation is:
   > M. Bevilacqua, A. Roumy, C. Guillemot, and M. L. Alberi-Morel. *Low-complexity single-image super-resolution based on nonnegative neighbor embedding*. 2012.

3. **Set14 Dataset**: This dataset is also used for validation. The citation is:
   > R. Zeyde, M. Elad, and M. Protter. *On single image scale-up using sparse-representations*. In International conference on curves and surfaces. Springer, pages 711–730, 2010.

4. **BSD100 Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned for evaluation. The citation is:
   > D. Martin, C. Fowlkes, D. Tal, and J. Malik. *A database of human segmented natural images and its application to evaluating segmentation algorithms and measuring ecological statistics*. In Proceedings Eighth IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision. ICCV 2001, vol. 2, pages 416–423, 2001.

5. **Urban100 Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluation as well. The citation is:
   > J.-B. Huang, A. Singh, and N. Ahuja. *Single image super-resolution from transformed self-exemplars*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 5197–5206, 2015.

6. **Manga109 Dataset**: This dataset is also used for evaluation. The citation is:
   > A. Fujimoto, T. Ogawa, K. Yamamoto, Y. Matsui, T. Yamasaki, and K. Aizawa. *Manga109 dataset and creation of metadata*. In Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on coMics ANalysis, Processing and Understanding, ACM, page 2, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
