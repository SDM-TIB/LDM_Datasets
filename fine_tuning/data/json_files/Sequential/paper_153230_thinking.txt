To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Why Attention? Analyze BiLSTM Deficiency and Its Remedies in the Case of NER" by Peng-Hsuan Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their methods on real-world NER datasets, specifically naming **OntoNotes 5.0** and **WNUT 2017**. This is a strong indication that these datasets are crucial to the paper's findings.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, they describe:

1. **OntoNotes 5.0**: A million-token corpus with diverse sources, including newswires and social media, containing 18 fine-grained entity types. This dataset is essential for evaluating NER performance across various domains.

2. **WNUT 2017**: A dataset focused on emerging named entity recognition, consisting of user-generated text from platforms like Twitter and YouTube. This dataset is designed to challenge models with noisy and non-standard text.

After identifying the datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **OntoNotes 5.0**, the citation is:
  > Hovy, E.; Marcus, M.; Palmer, M.; Ramshaw, L.; and Weischedel, R. (2006). *Ontonotes: The 90% solution*. In Proceedings of the Human Language Technology Conference of the NAACL, Companion Volume: Short Papers.

- For **WNUT 2017**, the citation is:
  > Derczynski, L.; Nichols, E.; van Erp, M.; and Limsopatham, N. (2017). *Results of the WNUT2017 shared task on novel and emerging entity recognition*. In Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Noisy User-generated Text.

Now that I have the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their significance as presented in the paper.
