To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Palomino-Ochoa at SemEval-2020 Task 9: Robust System based on Transformer for Code-Mixed Sentiment Classification" by Daniel Palomino and José Ochoa-Luna, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their system on the **Sentimix Spanglish test set of SemEval 2020 Task 9**, which suggests that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Background)**, where the authors describe the task and the datasets used. They mention that the task involves predicting sentiment classification for code-mixed tweets, specifically focusing on English-Spanish. They also note that the datasets are available in CoNLL-U format, which is important for understanding the structure of the data.

In **section 4.2 (Datasets)**, the authors provide specific details about the datasets used:
- **Training dataset**: 12,002 labeled tweets.
- **Validation dataset**: 2,998 labeled tweets.
- **Testing dataset**: 3,789 unlabeled tweets.

This section confirms the presence of three distinct datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** for these datasets in the **References section**. The authors reference the SemEval-2020 Task 9, which is crucial for proper citation. The relevant citation for the dataset is:

- For the **Sentimix Spanglish test set**, the citation is:
  > Parth Patwa, Gustavo Aguilar, Sudipta Kar, Suraj Pandey, Srinivas PYKL, Björn Gambäck, Tanmoy Chakraborty, Thamar Solorio, and Amitava Das. *SemEval-2020 Task 9: Overview of Sentiment Analysis of Code-Mixed Tweets*. In Proceedings of the 14th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2020), Barcelona, Spain, December. Association for Computational Linguistics.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
