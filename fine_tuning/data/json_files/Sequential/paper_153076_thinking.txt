To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scalable Syntax-Aware Language Models Using Knowledge Distillation" by Adhiguna Kuncoro et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of a knowledge distillation technique and mentions the use of a small corpus, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed. In this paper, the authors mention using the **Gulordava et al. (2018) dataset** for training their models. I will look for specific details about this dataset, such as its size, purpose, and any relevant characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, they describe the training and validation sets of the Gulordava et al. (2018) dataset, which consists of approximately 80 million tokens. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, particularly in evaluating the performance of their proposed models.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Gulordava et al. (2018) dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Kristina Gulordava, Piotr Bojanowski, Edouard Grave, Tal Linzen, and Marco Baroni. *Colorless green recurrent networks dream hierarchically*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 1195â€“1205, 2018.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about it.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset details, including its citation, to ensure that I have captured all necessary information for future reference or processing.
