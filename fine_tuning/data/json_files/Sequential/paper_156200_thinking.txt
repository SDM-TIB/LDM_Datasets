To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RoseNNa: A performant, portable library for neural network inference with application to computational fluid dynamics" by Ajay Bati and Spencer H. Bryngelson, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the performance of the RoseNNa library but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any references to datasets used in the experiments or literature surveys. The introduction mentions that the authors conducted a literature survey of about 25 papers that used neural networks for modeling and numerics tasks, but it does not specify any datasets directly.

I will then check the **design strategy** and **results sections** for any specific datasets that may have been used in the experiments or comparisons. The results section discusses performance comparisons with existing libraries like PyTorch and mentions architectures (MLPs and LSTMs) but does not provide specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets used for training or testing, I will look at the **references** section to see if any of the cited works include datasets that may be relevant. The references include various papers that might have datasets associated with them, but I need to verify if they are indeed datasets.

After reviewing the references, I find that some of the cited papers may have datasets associated with their methodologies. For example:

1. **Fukami et al. (2020)**: The paper discusses a convolutional autoencoder and multilayer perceptron for turbulence simulations, but I need to check the original paper for dataset details.
   - Citation: K. Fukami, T. Nakamura, K. Fukagata. *Convolutional neural network based hierarchical autoencoder for nonlinear mode decomposition of fluid field data*. Physics of Fluids 32 (2020) 095110.

2. **Zhu et al. (2021)**: This paper focuses on turbulence closure for high Reynolds number airfoil flows using deep neural networks. I will also need to check this paper for dataset information.
   - Citation: L. Zhu, W. Zhang, X. Sun, Y. Liu, X. Yuan. *Turbulence closure for high Reynolds number airfoil flows by deep neural networks*. Aerospace Science and Technology 110 (2021) 106452.

3. **Srinivasan et al. (2019)**: This paper discusses predictions of turbulent shear flows using deep neural networks, which may involve datasets.
   - Citation: P. A. Srinivasan, L. Guastoni, H. Azizpour, P. Schlatter, R. Vinuesa. *Predictions of turbulent shear flows using deep neural networks*. Physical Review Fluids 4 (2019) 054603.

4. **Li et al. (2020)**: This paper presents a reduced-order modeling of a wind-bridge interaction system using LSTM networks, which may also involve datasets.
   - Citation: T. Li, T. Wu, Z. Liu. *Nonlinear unsteady bridge aerodynamics: Reduced-order modeling based on deep LSTM networks*. Journal of Wind Engineering and Industrial Aerodynamics 198 (2020) 104116.

Since the original paper does not provide specific datasets, I will compile the relevant citations from the references that may lead to datasets used in the context of the research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset or relevant paper that may contain datasets, as this is crucial for proper documentation and future reference.
