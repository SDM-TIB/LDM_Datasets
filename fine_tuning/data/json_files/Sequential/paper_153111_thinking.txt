To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FairNAS: Rethinking Evaluation Fairness of Weight Sharing Neural Architecture Search" by Xiangxiang Chu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the experiments are conducted on **ImageNet**, which is a well-known dataset for image classification tasks. This indicates that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Setup)**, where the authors describe the search space and the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly state that the supernet experiments are performed on **ImageNet** and that they randomly select 50,000 images from the training set as their validation set. This confirms that **ImageNet** is indeed the dataset used in their experiments.

In addition, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The citation for the ImageNet dataset is:
> Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3), 211–252, 2015.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: ImageNet
   - **Description**: A large-scale dataset for image classification, consisting of millions of labeled images across thousands of categories.
   - **Full Citation**: Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3), 211–252, 2015.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that it is presented clearly and accurately, ready for any further processing or review.
