To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IMU-based Modularized Wearable Device for Human Motion Classification" by Sahan Wijethunga et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a wearable device for human motion analysis, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, it does indicate that the device is validated through case studies, which suggests that datasets may be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **Materials and Methods** section, particularly the subsections that describe the experiments conducted. In this section, the authors detail two case studies: one on hand gesture recognition and another on walking pattern analysis. I will look for any specific datasets or data collection methods mentioned in these subsections.

In the **Measurement** subsection, the authors describe the hand movements and walking patterns analyzed. They mention that data was collected for 13 hand movements and various walking patterns across different terrains and shoe types. However, they do not provide specific dataset names or references at this point.

I will then check the **Results** section to see if the authors refer to any datasets used for their analysis. They discuss the performance of their device and algorithms but do not provide explicit dataset names or citations.

Finally, I will review the **References** section to find any cited works that may correspond to datasets used in the study. The references may include foundational datasets or prior studies that utilized similar datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets. If specific datasets are not named in the paper, I will note that the authors conducted experiments based on their own data collection methods without referencing external datasets.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will ensure to include their full citations as follows:

1. For the hand gesture recognition dataset, if it is based on a known dataset, I will provide the citation for that dataset.
2. For the walking pattern analysis, if the authors reference a specific dataset or prior work, I will include that citation as well.

If no specific datasets are identified, I will summarize the data collection methods used in the experiments and note that the authors did not reference any external datasets.

In conclusion, I will ensure that I accurately document any datasets mentioned in the paper along with their full citations, adhering to the importance of proper referencing in academic work.
