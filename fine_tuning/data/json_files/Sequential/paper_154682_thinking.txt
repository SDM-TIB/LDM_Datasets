To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Text2App: A Framework for Creating Android Apps from Text Descriptions" by Masum Hasan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the framework and its capabilities but does not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction may provide insights into the data used for training the models.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Text2App)**, where the authors describe their methodology in detail. Here, they mention the creation of a **parallel NL-SAR corpus** for training their sequence-to-sequence models. This indicates that there is a dataset involved in the training process.

In **section 3.4 (Synthesizing Natural Language and SAR Parallel Data)**, the authors explain how they generated a dataset of 50,000 unique natural language (NL) and Simplified App Representation (SAR) pairs. This is a significant dataset for their experiments.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or used for evaluation purposes. However, the main dataset appears to be the one created for training the models.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets. The authors do not cite external datasets but rather describe the dataset they synthesized themselves.

The key dataset I will document is:

1. **NL-SAR Parallel Corpus**: A dataset consisting of 50,000 unique pairs of natural language descriptions and their corresponding Simplified App Representations (SAR). This dataset was synthesized based on a human survey and is crucial for training the sequence-to-sequence models.

Since this dataset is synthesized by the authors and does not have an external citation, I will note that in the documentation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the relevant details, including the description and the context in which it was used in the paper. This will ensure that the dataset is properly documented for future reference.
