To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Active Sensing for Localization with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface" by Zhongze Zhang, Tao Jiang, and Wei Yu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the experiments or simulations. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include dataset references.

I will then look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, there may be a section that discusses the datasets used for simulations or evaluations. This section is crucial as it typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the research.

If the paper includes a **results or numerical results section**, I will check there as well, as authors often refer back to the datasets when discussing their findings.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Rician channel model data" or "fingerprinting localization data," I will look for the original sources or papers that describe these datasets in detail.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation in the appropriate format.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
