To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Asymmetrical Bi-RNN for pedestrian trajectory encoding" by Raphaël Rozenberg et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **Trajnet++ benchmark**, which indicates that there are datasets involved. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in these sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors refer to the **Trajnet++ benchmark** and its significance in pedestrian trajectory forecasting. This suggests that the benchmark itself is a collection of datasets, and I need to identify the individual datasets that comprise it.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention several datasets that are part of the Trajnet++ benchmark:

1. **ETH Dataset**: This dataset is subdivided into ETH-hotel and ETH-uni, containing approximately 650 tracks extracted from 25 minutes of video.

2. **UCY Dataset**: This dataset is also subdivided into UCY-zara and UCY-students, with around 700 tracks extracted from 16 minutes of video.

3. **WildTrack Dataset**: This dataset includes approximately 650 tracks extracted from an hour of video.

4. **L-CAS Dataset**: This dataset consists of about 1100 tracks extracted from 49 minutes of video.

5. **CFF Dataset**: A large-scale dataset containing approximately 42 million trajectories extracted from real-world train stations.

The authors also mention that synthetic data generated using ORCA is used, but I will focus on the main datasets listed above.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations to ensure that they are ready for structured output or further processing.
