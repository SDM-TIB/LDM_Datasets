To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KILT: a Benchmark for Knowledge Intensive Language Tasks" by Fabio Petroni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract introduces the KILT benchmark and mentions that it consists of several datasets spanning five distinct tasks, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **section detailing the tasks and datasets**. In this section, the authors provide a comprehensive list of datasets used in the KILT benchmark. I will carefully note each dataset's name, its purpose, and any relevant details provided.

The paper lists the following datasets:

1. **FEVER**: A dataset for fact checking that requires retrieving sentence-level evidence to support claims.
   - Citation: Thorne, J., & Vlachos, A. (2018). *FEVER: A large-scale dataset for fact extraction and verification*. In NAACL-HLT.

2. **AIDA CoNLL-YAGO**: A dataset for entity linking that supplements the CoNLL 2003 dataset with Wikipedia URL annotations.
   - Citation: Hoffart, J., et al. (2011). *Robust disambiguation of named entities in text*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing.

3. **WNED-WIKI**: A dataset for entity linking created by sampling documents from Wikipedia.
   - Citation: Guo, Z., & Barbosa, D. (2018). *Robust named entity disambiguation with random walks*. Semantic Web.

4. **WNED-CWEB**: Similar to WNED-WIKI but sampled from the ClueWeb 2012 corpus.
   - Citation: Guo, Z., & Barbosa, D. (2018). *Robust named entity disambiguation with random walks*. Semantic Web.

5. **T-REx**: A dataset that aligns natural language with knowledge base triples.
   - Citation: Elsahar, H., et al. (2018). *T-REx: A large scale alignment of natural language with knowledge base triples*. LREC.

6. **Zero Shot RE**: A dataset designed for zero-shot relation extraction.
   - Citation: Levy, O., et al. (2017). *Zero-shot relation extraction via reading comprehension*. CoNLL.

7. **Natural Questions (NQ)**: A dataset for open-domain question answering that includes real questions issued to Google.
   - Citation: Kwiatkowski, T., et al. (2019). *Natural questions: A benchmark for question answering research*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

8. **HotpotQA**: A dataset requiring multi-hop reasoning over multiple Wikipedia pages to answer questions.
   - Citation: Yang, Z., et al. (2018). *HotpotQA: A dataset for diverse, explainable multi-hop question answering*. EMNLP.

9. **TriviaQA**: A collection of question-answer-evidence triples.
   - Citation: Joshi, M., et al. (2017). *TriviaQA: A large scale distantly supervised challenge dataset for reading comprehension*. ACL.

10. **ELI5**: A dataset for long-form question answering.
    - Citation: Fan, A., et al. (2019). *ELI5: Long form question answering*. ACL.

11. **Wizard of Wikipedia (WoW)**: A dataset for dialogue that requires grounding responses in Wikipedia knowledge.
    - Citation: Dinan, E., et al. (2019). *Wizard of Wikipedia: Knowledge-powered conversational agents*. ICLR.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for each, as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that can be used for further analysis or integration into a larger dataset repository.
