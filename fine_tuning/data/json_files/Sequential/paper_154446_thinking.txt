To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Automated Satellite Conjunction Management with Bayesian Deep Learning" by Francesco Pinto et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a Bayesian deep learning approach for predicting conjunction events using conjunction data messages (CDMs), which suggests that a dataset related to CDMs is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the lack of publicly available large-scale CDM datasets and specifically refer to the **Kelvins dataset** provided by the European Space Agency (ESA). This indicates that the Kelvins dataset is a key dataset used in their research.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they used the **Kelvins dataset** for training their model. They describe the dataset's characteristics, including the time period it covers (2015 to 2019) and the modifications made to anonymize sensitive data. This section provides essential details about the dataset's content and its relevance to the study.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the Kelvins dataset. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and can be found in the context of the Spacecraft Collision Avoidance Challenge, which is mentioned in the paper.

The full citation for the **Kelvins dataset** is:
> European Space Agency. *Kelvins Dataset for the Spacecraft Collision Avoidance Challenge*. Available at: https://kelvins.esa.int/collision-avoidance-challenge/data/ (Accessed: August 2020).

Since the paper primarily discusses the Kelvins dataset, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Kelvins dataset, ensuring it is ready for any further processing or review.
