To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Error Correction Neural Networks for Economic Forecasting" by Mhlasakululeka Mvubu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for testing the proposed model.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors describe the data used for their experiments. Here, they mention that the ECNN algorithm was tested on four stock indices: **S&P 500 (GSPC) Index, Hang Seng Index (HSI), Nikkei 225 Index (N225), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) Index**. This indicates that these indices are the datasets used for evaluation.

In the **data subsection (3.1)**, the authors provide details about the datasets, including the source of the historical stock data, which is from **Yahoo Finance** for the period from **2002-01-01 to 2016-01-01**. They also mention the types of data included in each dataset, such as closing price, opening price, high price, low price, and volume of trade.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. Since the datasets are based on stock indices, I will cite the relevant sources for each index:

1. **S&P 500 (GSPC) Index**: The citation for the S&P 500 data is:
   > Yahoo Finance. *S&P 500 Index (GSPC)*. Available at: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/^GSPC (Accessed: 21-May-2017).

2. **Hang Seng Index (HSI)**: The citation for the Hang Seng Index data is:
   > Yahoo Finance. *Hang Seng Index (HSI)*. Available at: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/^HSI (Accessed: 21-May-2017).

3. **Nikkei 225 Index (N225)**: The citation for the Nikkei 225 data is:
   > Yahoo Finance. *Nikkei 225 Index (N225)*. Available at: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/^N225 (Accessed: 21-May-2017).

4. **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) Index**: The citation for the DJIA data is:
   > Yahoo Finance. *Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)*. Available at: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/^DJI (Accessed: 21-May-2017).

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
