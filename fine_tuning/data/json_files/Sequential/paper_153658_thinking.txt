To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Spike in Performance: Training Hybrid-Spiking Neural Networks with Quantized Activation Functions" by Aaron R. Voelker et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and I will look for any mentions of datasets used for evaluation or experimentation. 

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that the authors may have used to benchmark their methods. This section often contains context about the datasets relevant to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and testing the models. I will look for specific dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics that the authors provide.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Sequential MNIST (sMNIST)**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed hybrid-spiking neural networks. The authors describe it as a time-series version of the MNIST dataset, where the pixels of the digits are presented sequentially.

2. **Permuted Sequential MNIST (psMNIST)**: This dataset is a variant of the sequential MNIST dataset, where the sequences are permuted, increasing the difficulty of the task.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I find are:

- For **Sequential MNIST**:
  > Le, Q. V., Jaitly, N., & Hinton, G. E. (2015). A simple way to initialize recurrent networks of rectified linear units. arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.00941.

- For **Permuted Sequential MNIST**:
  > Le, Q. V., Jaitly, N., & Hinton, G. E. (2015). A simple way to initialize recurrent networks of rectified linear units. arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.00941. (Note: The same citation is used as it is a variant of the original MNIST dataset.)

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation for proper referencing.
