To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting Deepfake Videos: An Analysis of Three Techniques" by Armaan Pishori et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions participation in the **Deepfake Detection Challenge**, which suggests that there is a dataset involved in this competition.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets used. The **introduction** provides context about the competition and mentions that participants were provided with **500 GB of video data** consisting of both real and fake videos. This indicates that there is a significant dataset being utilized, but I need to find its formal citation.

I will then check the **related work** and **methodology sections** for any references to specific datasets. In the **related work** section, the authors mention the **Deepfake Detection Challenge** and refer to the dataset provided for the competition. However, they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset.

To find the full citation for the **Deepfake Detection Challenge dataset**, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. Here, I find the following citation:

- **Deepfake Detection Challenge**: 
  > “Deepfake Detection Challenge.” Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge/overview.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors discuss various techniques and methods, but they primarily focus on the **Deepfake Detection Challenge dataset** as the main dataset used for their experiments.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **Deepfake Detection Challenge dataset**. Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will finalize my extraction process here.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the **Deepfake Detection Challenge dataset** with the necessary details and citation.
