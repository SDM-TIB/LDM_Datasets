To extract datasets from the research paper titled "InceptionTime vs. Wavelet â€“ A Comparison for Time Series Classification" by Daniel Klenkert et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the classification of infrasound data but does not specify any datasets. However, the introduction mentions that labeled training data was generated by numerical simulation of eight different classes of infrasound-producing events, which suggests that there is a dataset involved, but I need more details.

Next, I will examine the **Data Preprocessing section** (Section 3) closely. Here, the authors state that the training data consisted of **2400 different infrasound signals**, each containing **94 data points**. This indicates that the dataset is based on simulated infrasound signals, but I need to clarify if there is a formal name for this dataset.

Since the paper does not provide a specific name for the dataset, I will refer to it as the **Infrasound Signal Dataset** for the purpose of documentation. I will also note that the dataset is derived from numerical simulations of infrasound-producing events, which is important for understanding its context.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the dataset. The references primarily discuss methodologies and tools used in the study, such as the fastai library and wavelet analysis, but do not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself. Since the dataset is generated from simulations, it may not have a traditional citation like publicly available datasets.

Given this information, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Infrasound Signal Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2400 simulated infrasound signals, each with 94 data points. It is used for training and validation in the classification tasks described in the paper.

Since there is no formal citation for the dataset, I will note that it is based on numerical simulations of infrasound events, but I will not be able to provide a full citation as there is none available in the references.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I highlight the lack of a formal citation while providing a description of the dataset's origin and purpose.
