To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tailor: Generating and Perturbing Text with Semantic Controls" by Alexis Ross et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that Tailor is used to create high-quality contrast sets for various NLP tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections** where the authors discuss the applications of Tailor. In the **contrast set creation section**, they mention generating contrast sets for four distinct NLP tasks: **BoolQ**, **SQuAD**, **UD English**, and **MATRES**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are relevant to the research.

I will then look for specific details about each dataset in the text. The authors provide descriptions and context for how Tailor was applied to each dataset:

1. **BoolQ**: A dataset for yes/no questions, where the authors mention replicating contrast sets based on the original dataset.
   - Citation: Clark, K., Lee, K., Chang, M.-W., Kwiatkowski, T., Collins, M., & Toutanova, K. (2019). BoolQ: Exploring the surprising difficulty of natural yes/no questions. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pages 2924–2936.

2. **SQuAD**: A dataset for machine comprehension, where the authors discuss creating contrast sets for question answering.
   - Citation: Rajpurkar, P., Zhang, J., Lopyrev, K., & Liang, P. (2016). SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2383–2392.

3. **UD English**: This dataset is used for dependency parsing, and the authors mention using Tailor to create contrast sets that involve syntactic changes.
   - Citation: Nivre, J., de Marneffe, M.-C., Ginter, F., Goldberg, Y., Hajič, J., Manning, C. D., McDonald, R., Petrov, S., Pyysalo, S., Silveira, N., Tsarfaty, R., & Zeman, D. (2016). Universal Dependencies v1: A multilingual treebank collection. In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’16), pages 1659–1666.

4. **MATRES**: A dataset for temporal relation extraction, where the authors describe how Tailor was used to generate contrast sets.
   - Citation: Ning, Q., Wu, H., & Roth, D. (2018). A multi-axis annotation scheme for event temporal relations. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1318–1328.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for each one, as they are crucial for proper attribution in any subsequent analysis or application of the research findings.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description of its use in the paper, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
