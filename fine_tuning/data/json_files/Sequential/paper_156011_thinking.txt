To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Electricity Demand Forecasting with Hybrid Statistical and Machine Learning Algorithms: Case Study of Ukraine" by T. González Grandón et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used **hourly data from Ukraine’s electricity consumption ranging from 2013 to 2020**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their analysis.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. The authors refer to the data obtained from **Ukrenergo**, which provides the hourly power balance of Ukraine. This is a key dataset for their study.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the importance of accurate forecasts for electricity demand, which further emphasizes the relevance of the dataset they are using. They also reference macroeconomic factors and temperature data, which are likely derived from other datasets but are not explicitly named as separate datasets in this context.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

1. For the **hourly power balance of Ukraine**:
   > Ukrenergo. *Hourly power balance of Ukraine*. Available at: https://data.gov.ua/dataset/31199018-e15e-4e87-bf5e-2a4293151f5c/resource/0cf8c840-7d54-4dba-86c1-8802884e7469, 2020. Accessed 11.02.19.

2. For the **macroeconomic factors**:
   > The World Bank. *World development indicators*. 2020. Data retrieved from World Development Indicators, http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators.

3. For the **temperature data**:
   > Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO). *Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC), MERRA-2 statD 2d slv Nx 2d, daily, aggregated statistics*. 2015. Accessed 10.07.2021 at doi:10.5067/9SC1VNTWGWV3.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the requirements. This will provide a clear overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their full citations for reference.
