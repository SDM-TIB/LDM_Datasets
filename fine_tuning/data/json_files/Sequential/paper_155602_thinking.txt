To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prediction-based Hybrid Slicing Framework for Service Level Agreement Guarantee in Mobility Scenarios: A Deep Learning Approach" by Heng Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference existing datasets or benchmarks relevant to their work.

I will then look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors describe their methodology, which includes a two-step deep learning solution involving LSTM networks for traffic and location prediction. They mention using historical data for training, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation. The authors mention a dataset containing location and traffic historical data of two slices: 6000 trajectories of V2X UEs and corresponding length data of eMBB UEs. This indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to document.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references a real traffic dataset generated by the OpenAirInterface software-defined radio platform, which is crucial for the eMBB UEs.

The citations I will extract are:

1. For the **OpenAirInterface dataset** used for eMBB UEs:
   > EURECOM. OpenAirInterfaceâ€“5G software alliance for democratising wireless innovation [EB/OL]. https://openairinterface.org/.

2. For the **historical data of location and traffic** of V2X UEs, the paper does not provide a specific citation, but it mentions that the data consists of 6000 trajectories.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
