To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Dynamic Model for Traffic Flow Prediction Using Improved DRN" by Zeren Tan and Ruimin Li, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract discusses the use of real-time traffic flow data collected by microwave detectors, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Data Source)**, where the authors provide specific details about the dataset used in their experiments. Here, they mention that the data comes from the ring roads in Beijing, collected by 14 microwave detectors over a period of 61 days, with a total of 8784 data points collected at 10-minute intervals.

The dataset is described as follows:
- **Traffic Flow Data from Beijing Ring Roads**: This dataset consists of traffic flow measurements collected from 14 microwave detectors, with each detector providing data at 10-minute intervals over a period of 61 days.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is based on original data collected by the authors and does not have a formal citation like a published dataset, I will note that the dataset is proprietary and specific to their research.

In summary, I will compile the dataset information as follows:
1. **Traffic Flow Data from Beijing Ring Roads**: This dataset is collected from 14 microwave detectors over 61 days, with a total of 8784 data points recorded at 10-minute intervals. The dataset is proprietary to the authors and does not have a formal citation.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format for further processing or review.
