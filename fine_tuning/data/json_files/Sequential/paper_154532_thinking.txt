To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Early Abandoning and Pruning for Elastic Distances including Dynamic Time Warping" by Matthieu Herrmann and Geoffrey I. Webb, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experimental sections typically detail the datasets employed in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets or benchmarks that the authors might have used to validate their methods. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section is crucial as it usually contains explicit mentions of the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for subsections that describe the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any specific configurations used during the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention the **UCR time series archive** as a source of datasets for their experiments. They also refer to specific datasets from this archive, which is a key point for my extraction.

Now, I will compile the datasets identified in the paper along with their full citations. The UCR time series archive is a well-known resource, and I will ensure to provide the citation for it as well as any specific datasets mentioned.

The citation for the UCR time series archive is:
> Hoang Anh Dau, Anthony Bagnall, Kaveh Kamgar, Chin-Chia Michael Yeh, Yan Zhu, Shaghayegh Gharghabi, Chotirat Ann Ratanamahatana, and Eamonn Keogh. *The UCR Time Series Archive*. arXiv:1810.07758 [cs, stat], September 2019.

Additionally, I will check the references section for any other datasets that might have been used in the experiments, ensuring that I capture their full citations as well.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a clear format, ready for further processing or review.
