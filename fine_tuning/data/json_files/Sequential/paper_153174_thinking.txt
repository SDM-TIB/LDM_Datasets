To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AutoML: A Survey of the State-of-the-Art" by Xin He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on automated machine learning (AutoML) and mentions various tasks and benchmarks, which may hint at specific datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **main body** of the paper, particularly in sections that discuss experiments, evaluations, or comparisons. I will pay close attention to sections that detail the methodologies or results, as these often include references to the datasets used.

In the **data preparation** section, the authors discuss various datasets, including:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset used for image classification, containing over 14 million images across thousands of categories.

I will also check the **experiments** and **results** sections to confirm the use of these datasets and to see if any additional datasets are mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: A Benchmark in Machine Learning*. 2009. URL: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
> Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015. doi:10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for clarity and ease of use in future references or applications.
