To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Similarity Embedding Networks for Robust Human Activity Recognition" by Chenglin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their methods on two public datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. In this section, they mention two datasets:

1. **USC-HAD Dataset**: This dataset was collected using a wired sensing platform called MotionNode at a sampling rate of 100Hz. It includes 12 activities and 6 users, with a total of 3,170 samples.

2. **HHAR Dataset**: This dataset was collected using various smartphones with sampling rates ranging from 50Hz to 200Hz. It includes 14 activities and 9 users, with a total of 9,335 samples.

The authors also provide a table (Table 1) summarizing the details of both datasets, which confirms the information I have gathered.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **USC-HAD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mi Zhang and Alexander A Sawchuk. *USC-HAD: a daily activity dataset for ubiquitous activity recognition using wearable sensors*. In Proceedings of the 2012 ACM Conference on Ubiquitous Computing, pages 1036–1043, 2012.

- For the **HHAR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Allan Stisen, Henrik Blunck, Sourav Bhattacharya, Thor Siiger Prentow, Mikkel Baun Kjærgaard, Anind Dey, Tobias Sonne, and Mads Møller Jensen. *Smart devices are different: Assessing and mitigating mobile sensing heterogeneities for activity recognition*. In Proceedings of the 13th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems, pages 127–140, 2015.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and ensure that all relevant details are captured for further processing or review.
