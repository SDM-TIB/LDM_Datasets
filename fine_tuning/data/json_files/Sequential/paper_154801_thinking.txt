To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continuous Wavelet Vocoder-based Decomposition of Parametric Speech Waveform Synthesis" by Mohammed Salah Al-Radhi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental evaluations sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly where the authors describe their experimental setup. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and testing their models. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and characteristics.

In the **experimental evaluations section**, the authors often describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will pay close attention to any specific datasets mentioned, including their sizes, types, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the experiments.

From my reading, I note that the authors mention using the **CMU-ARCTIC database** for their evaluations. This is a well-known dataset in the field of speech synthesis, and I will need to gather its full citation.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the complete citation for the CMU-ARCTIC database. The citation provided in the paper is:
> J. Kominek and A. W. Black, "The CMU ARCTIC speech databases," in: Proceedings of the 5th ISCA Speech Synthesis Workshop, Pittsburgh, USA, 2004, pp. 223â€“224.

I will also check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper, such as those used for comparison with their proposed method. The authors reference several other vocoders and methods, but they do not specify additional datasets beyond the CMU-ARCTIC database.

Finally, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will allow for easy reference and use in future research or applications.

In summary, the key steps I will take are:
1. Read through the abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental evaluations sections to identify datasets.
2. Note any datasets mentioned, focusing on their names and characteristics.
3. Retrieve full citations for each dataset from the references section.
4. Compile the dataset information for clarity and future reference.
