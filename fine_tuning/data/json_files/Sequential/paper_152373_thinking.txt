To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating Text with Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Hongyu Guo, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed strategy was trained on "ten thousands natural sentences," which suggests that a specific dataset is used for training.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Task and Dataset)**, where the author explicitly describes the dataset used for the experiments. Here, the paper states that the experimental task involves training a network to regenerate natural sentences using a dataset randomly selected from the **Billion Word Corpus**. The author specifies that they randomly selected **12,000 sentences** from this corpus, with a maximum length of 30 words.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Billion Word Corpus**. The citation provided in the references is:

> Chelba, C., Mikolov, T., Schuster, M., Ge, Q., Brants, T., Koehn, P., & Robinson, T. (2014). One billion word benchmark for measuring progress in statistical language modeling. In *INTERSPEECH 2014*, pages 2635â€“2639.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Billion Word Corpus**: A large dataset used for training the model, consisting of 12,000 sentences selected for the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
