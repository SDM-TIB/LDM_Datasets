To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Imitation Learning Approach for Cache Replacement" by Evan Zheran Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method (PARROT) on various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved, but does not specify their names.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any references to specific datasets. The introduction provides context about caching and mentions the use of memory-intensive SPEC applications, which indicates that these applications may be part of the datasets used for evaluation.

I will then look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention evaluating their approach on the **SPEC CPU2006** benchmark applications and a **Google Web Search** workload. This is a strong indication that these are the datasets used for their experiments.

In the **experimental setup** subsection, the authors detail how they collected raw memory access traces from the SPEC applications over a 50-second interval. They also mention that they randomly chose 64 sets from the last-level cache to collect accesses, which further confirms the use of the SPEC CPU2006 dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The SPEC CPU2006 benchmark is a well-known dataset, and I can find its citation in the references:

- For **SPEC CPU2006**, the citation is:
  > Henning, J. L. (2006). SPEC CPU2006 benchmark descriptions. ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News, 34(4), 1-17.

The Google Web Search workload is mentioned as an industrial-scale application but does not have a specific citation in the references. It is generally known in the field, but I will note that it is not formally cited in this paper.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **SPEC CPU2006**: A benchmark suite used for evaluating the performance of CPU architectures, consisting of various memory-intensive applications.
2. **Google Web Search**: An industrial-scale application workload used for testing the proposed cache replacement policy.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the full citations, ensuring that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research.
