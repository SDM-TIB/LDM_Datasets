To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Composer Style Classification of Piano Sheet Music Images Using Language Model Pretraining" by TJ Tsai and Kevin Ji, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize a large set of unlabeled data, specifically mentioning the **IMSLP dataset** as the source for training their language models. This is a strong indication that the dataset is significant to their research.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe their data collection process. They mention that they scraped the IMSLP website to download all PDF scores and accompanying metadata, filtering the data to focus on solo piano scores. They specify that the resulting dataset contains **29,310 PDFs, 255,539 pages, and a total of 48.5 million bootleg score features**. This detailed description confirms the dataset's relevance and size.

In this section, they also clarify that the cleaned dataset used for classification tasks is a subset of the IMSLP data, which they refer to as the **target dataset**. They provide details on how they curated this dataset, including the number of pages and bootleg score features per composer.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the IMSLP dataset. However, since the IMSLP is a well-known repository and not a traditional dataset published in a paper, I will note that the citation for the IMSLP dataset is typically referenced as follows:

- **IMSLP Dataset**: 
  > International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP). Available at: http://imslp.org/

Additionally, I will note that the authors mention using the bootleg score feature representation, which is derived from the IMSLP dataset. However, this is not a separate dataset but rather a method of processing the sheet music images.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the IMSLP dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent work or analysis.
