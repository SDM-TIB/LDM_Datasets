To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative Dialogue Policy for Task-oriented Dialogue Systems," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, which suggests that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In **section 5.1 (Datasets)**, they specifically mention two datasets:

1. **DSTC2 Dataset**: This dataset is described as a human-machine dataset in the single domain of restaurant searching. It has a training set of 1612 examples, a test set of 506 examples, and a development set of 1117 examples. The dataset includes 11 dialogue actions (e.g., offer, inform, request) and 8 slots (e.g., area, food, price) with a total of 212 distinct values.

2. **Maluuba Dataset**: This dataset is characterized as a more complex human-human dataset in the travel booking domain. It contains 8621 training examples, 478 test examples, and 480 development examples. The dataset features 16 dialogue actions and 60 slots, with continuous values for some slots, making it more challenging for classification models.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following:

- For the **DSTC2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Henderson, M., Thomson, B., & Williams, J. D. (2014). The second dialog state tracking challenge. In Proceedings of the 15th Annual Meeting of the Special Interest Group on Discourse and Dialogue (SIGDIAL), pages 263â€“272.

- For the **Maluuba Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Asri, L. E., Schulz, H., Sharma, S., Zumer, J., Harris, J., Fine, E., Mehrotra, R., & Suleman, K. (2017). Frames: A corpus for adding memory to goal-oriented dialogue systems. arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.00057.

Now that I have the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
