To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast AutoAugment" by Sungbin Lim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on various datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, they mention using **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet** for their experiments. I will take note of these datasets and look for specific details about each one.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide performance results on these datasets, confirming their use. They also mention the number of samples and the context in which these datasets were used, which is crucial for understanding the application of the datasets.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

1. **CIFAR-10**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, 2009.

3. **SVHN**: The citation is:
   > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. 2011.

4. **ImageNet**: The citation is:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248â€“255, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
