To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Canonical and Surface Morphological Segmentation for Nguni Languages" by Tumi Moeng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses morphological segmentation for Nguni languages, which suggests that datasets related to these languages may be included.

Next, I will focus on the **data section** (Section 2.3) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they refer to the **Annotated Text Corpora from the National Center for Human Technology (NCHLT)**, which includes morphological annotations for isiNdebele, isiXhosa, isiZulu, and siSwati. This indicates that these languages are the focus of their dataset.

In the same section, the authors provide details about the size of the datasets for each language, which is crucial for understanding the scope of the data. They mention the number of words in the training, development, and test sets for each language, which I will note down.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the NCHLT dataset. The authors cite a previous work by Eiselen and Puttkammer (2014) that discusses the development of text resources for South African languages. This citation will be important for providing the authoritative source for the dataset.

The relevant datasets and their citations are as follows:

1. **NCHLT isiZulu Dataset**: 
   - Citation: Eiselen, R., & Puttkammer, M. (2014). Developing text resources for ten South African languages. In Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC-2014), pages 3698–3703, Reykjavik, Iceland. European Languages Resources Association (ELRA).

2. **NCHLT isiXhosa Dataset**: 
   - Citation: Eiselen, R., & Puttkammer, M. (2014). Developing text resources for ten South African languages. In Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC-2014), pages 3698–3703, Reykjavik, Iceland. European Languages Resources Association (ELRA).

3. **NCHLT isiNdebele Dataset**: 
   - Citation: Eiselen, R., & Puttkammer, M. (2014). Developing text resources for ten South African languages. In Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC-2014), pages 3698–3703, Reykjavik, Iceland. European Languages Resources Association (ELRA).

4. **NCHLT siSwati Dataset**: 
   - Citation: Eiselen, R., & Puttkammer, M. (2014). Developing text resources for ten South African languages. In Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC-2014), pages 3698–3703, Reykjavik, Iceland. European Languages Resources Association (ELRA).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
