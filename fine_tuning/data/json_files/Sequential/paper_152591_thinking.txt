To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Persistence pays off: Paying Attention to What the LSTM Gating Mechanism Persists" by Giancarlo D. Salton and John D. Kelleher, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of a memory-augmented LSTM on the Penn Treebank and wikitext2 datasets, indicating that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly mention using the **Penn Treebank (PTB)** dataset and the **wikitext2** dataset for their evaluations. I will note the specifics of each dataset as described in the text.

In the experiments section, the authors provide details about the PTB dataset, stating it consists of 887K tokens for training, 70K for validation, and 78K for testing. For the wikitext2 dataset, they mention it contains around 2M tokens for training, 217K for validation, and 245K for testing. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' structure and usage.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources.

- For the **Penn Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Mitchell Marcus, Grace Kim, Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz, Robert MacIntyre, Ann Bies, Mark Ferguson, Karen Katz, and Britta Schasberger. *The Penn Treebank: Annotating Predicate Argument Structure*. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Human Language Technology, pages 114–119, 1994.

- For the **wikitext2 dataset**, the citation is:

With this information, I will summarize the datasets, ensuring to include their names, descriptions, and full citations. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
