To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Representation Learning for Traffic Flow Prediction" by Lingbo Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on two standard benchmarks for traffic flow prediction, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will carefully read through the **experiments section** (Section VI) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two datasets: **TaxiBJ** and **BikeNYC**. I will note down the details provided for each dataset, including the city, grid map size, data type, time span, external factors, and any other relevant metrics.

In the **Table I** of the paper, the authors provide a summary of both datasets, which includes:
- **TaxiBJ Dataset**: This dataset contains taxi GPS trajectories collected from over 34,000 taxicabs in Beijing, covering a time span from July 1, 2013, to April 10, 2016. The data is recorded at half-hour intervals and includes various external factors such as weather conditions and holidays.
- **BikeNYC Dataset**: This dataset consists of bike rental data from New York City, covering a time span from April 1, 2014, to September 30, 2014, with a one-hour time interval. It also includes holiday information.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will typically include the authors, title, conference or journal name, and publication year.

For the **TaxiBJ Dataset**, the citation is:
> Zhang, J., Zheng, Y., & Qi, D. (2017). Deep spatio-temporal residual networks for citywide crowd flows prediction. In AAAI (pp. 1655–1661).

For the **BikeNYC Dataset**, the citation is:
> Zhang, J., Zheng, Y., & Qi, D. (2017). Deep spatio-temporal residual networks for citywide crowd flows prediction. In AAAI (pp. 1655–1661).

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the details into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
