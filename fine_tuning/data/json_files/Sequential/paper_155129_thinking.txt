To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Financial Embedding Analysis of Sentiment" by Asier Gutiérrez-Fandiño et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of financial sentiment analysis and mention that they leverage a large-scale financial analysis news dataset from RavenPack. This indicates that a specific dataset is being used, but I need to gather more details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for training and testing their models. Here, they mention using the **US_news dataset from RavenPack**. They provide specific details about the dataset, including the number of instances for different timeframes:

1. **Six months of data** leading up to February 11, 2021, resulting in 2,279,823 instances.
2. **One year of data** leading up to February 11, 2021, resulting in 4,847,629 instances.
3. **Two years of data** leading up to February 11, 2021, resulting in 12,358,024 instances.
4. An additional **two-week out-of-sample data** for testing, consisting of 274,190 instances.

The authors also mention that they filtered the dataset by retaining the top fifty companies in the US and removed any duplicate entries. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- **RavenPack US_news dataset**: 
  > RavenPack Analytics. *RavenPack Analytics delivers sentiment scores and event-based data that are likely to have an impact on security prices and financial markets worldwide*. Available at: https://www.ravenpack.com

Since the dataset is proprietary and not publicly accessible, I will note that in my extraction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the RavenPack dataset as it is essential for proper attribution.

After completing these steps, I will have a clear and comprehensive extraction of the dataset used in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
