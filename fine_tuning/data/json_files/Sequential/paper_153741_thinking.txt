To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lifelong Learning with Searchable Extension Units" by Wenjin Wang, Yunqing Hu, and Yin Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to experimental results on several datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section III) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **PMNIST**: This dataset is derived from the MNIST dataset, where a unique fixed random permutation is applied to shuffle the pixels of each sample to generate a task.

2. **Split CIFAR10**: This dataset is a subset of the CIFAR10 dataset, containing 5 two-class classification tasks.

3. **Split CIFAR100**: Similar to the split CIFAR10, this dataset is derived from CIFAR100 and consists of 5 twenty-class classification tasks.

4. **Mixture Dataset**: This dataset includes five different tasks: EMNIST, MNIST, Fashion MNIST, SVHN, and KMNIST.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **PMNIST**, the citation is:
  > Y. LeCun, “The MNIST database of handwritten digits,” http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > A. Krizhevsky et al., “Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images,” Citeseer, Tech. Rep., 2009.

- For **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > A. Krizhevsky et al., “Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images,” Citeseer, Tech. Rep., 2009.

- For **EMNIST**, the citation is:
  > G. Cohen, S. Afshar, J. Tapson, and A. Van Schaik, “EMNIST: Extending MNIST to handwritten letters,” in 2017 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), IEEE, 2017, pp. 2921–2926.

- For **Fashion MNIST**, the citation is:
  > H. Xiao, K. Rasul, and R. Vollgraf, “Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms,” ArXiv, vol. abs/1708.07747, 2017.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Y. Netzer et al., “Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning,” 2011.

- For **KMNIST**, the citation is:
  > T. Clanuwat et al., “Deep learning for classical Japanese literature,” ArXiv, vol. abs/1812.01718, 2018.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research.
