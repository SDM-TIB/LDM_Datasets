To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recoding latent sentence representations" by Dennis Ulmer, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention key datasets used in the study. In the abstract, I will look for any explicit references to datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** (section 5), as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any subsections specifically labeled as "Datasets" or similar, where the authors might describe the datasets in detail, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

In section 5.1, the authors mention using the **Penn Treebank (PTB)** dataset, which consists of documents in American English and is annotated with linguistic information. I will note the specifics of this dataset, including its size and the type of data it contains.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. For the **Penn Treebank**, the citation is:
> Marcus, Mitchell, Beatrice Santorini, and Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz. "Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank." 1993.

If there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper, I will follow the same steps: identify them in the relevant sections, note their descriptions, and find their full citations in the references.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation, as this is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for any further processing or review.
