To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning TFIDF Enhanced Joint Embedding for Recipe-Image Cross-Modal Retrieval Service" by Zhongwei Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the experiments were conducted on the **Recipe1M dataset**, which is a significant clue that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the introduction, the authors mention that Recipe1M contains over 800K structured cooking recipes and over 1 million associated images. This reinforces the importance of the Recipe1M dataset in their work.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their approach on the **Recipe1M dataset**. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of matching pairs of images and recipes after filtering, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Recipe1M dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Salvador, A., Hynes, N., Aytar, Y., Marin, J., Oflı, F., Weber, I., & Torralba, A. (2017). Learning cross-modal embeddings for cooking recipes and food images. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (pp. 3020–3028).

Since the Recipe1M dataset is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will summarize my findings:

1. **Recipe1M Dataset**: This dataset consists of over 800K structured cooking recipes and over 1 million associated images, making it a comprehensive resource for cross-modal retrieval tasks.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset and its citation, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper attribution.
