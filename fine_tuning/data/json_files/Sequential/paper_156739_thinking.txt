To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gated recurrent neural network with TPE Bayesian optimization for enhancing stock index prediction accuracy" by Bivas Dinda, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and data description sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study focuses on predicting the NIFTY 50 index using various models, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the complexity of stock markets and the need for accurate predictions, hinting at the use of historical data for training the models. However, I need to look for specific dataset details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Data description)**, where the author explicitly describes the dataset used for the study. The paper mentions that the NIFTY 50 time series data is collected from Yahoo Finance from January 2, 2009, to December 31, 2023, comprising 3649 samples. This section also lists the features used in the model, which include:

1. NIFTY closing price (in ₹)
2. S&P 500 closing price (in $)
3. Crude oil price (in $)
4. NIFTY volatility index (in ₹)
5. USD to INR exchange rate (in ₹)
6. Gold price (in $)
7. MACD
8. RSI

The data sources for these features are primarily Yahoo Finance and Investing.com, which are crucial for citation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. Since the datasets are derived from publicly available financial data, I will note that the specific datasets do not have formal citations like traditional datasets but can be referenced as follows:

- For the **NIFTY 50 dataset**:
  > National Stock Exchange of India. *NIFTY 50 Index Data*. Retrieved from Yahoo Finance: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ENSEI/

- For the **S&P 500 dataset**:
  > Standard & Poor's. *S&P 500 Index Data*. Retrieved from Yahoo Finance: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
