To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Neural Abstractive Summarization Systems and Evaluation against Adversarial Information" by Lisa Fan, Dong Yu, and Lu Wang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets, while the experimental setup typically details the datasets used in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the **experimental setup section**, I find that the authors mention two datasets:

1. **CNN/Daily Mail corpus**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation, consisting of news articles paired with human-written summaries. The authors specify that they follow the experimental setup from See et al. (2017) and provide the number of training, validation, and test pairs.

2. **New York Times corpus**: This dataset is also used for training and evaluation. The authors describe their preprocessing steps and the number of samples included in the training, validation, and test sets.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **CNN/Daily Mail corpus**, the citation is:
  > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomas Kocisky, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2015.

- For the **New York Times corpus**, the citation is:
  > Evan Sandhaus. *The New York Times Annotated Corpus*. Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia, 2008.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work.
