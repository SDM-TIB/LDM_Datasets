To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficiently applying attention to sequential data with the Recurrent Discounted Attention unit" by Brendan Maginnis and Pierre H. Richemond, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 6) where the authors describe the tasks they performed and the datasets they used. In this section, they mention the **Hutter Prize Wikipedia dataset**, which is a significant dataset for character-level language modeling. The authors state that they evaluate their models on this dataset, which indicates its importance in their experiments.

I will also check the **related work section** (section 2) to see if any other datasets are referenced, particularly those used in previous studies that might be relevant to their work. However, the primary focus will be on the datasets explicitly mentioned in the experiments.

In the **references section**, I will look for full citations for the datasets mentioned. For the **Hutter Prize Wikipedia dataset**, the citation is:
> Mahoney, M. (2005). *PAQ8hp12*. In Proceedings of the 2005 Data Compression Conference (DCC), pages 8-12.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Hutter Prize Wikipedia dataset.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entry for downstream processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and reference.
