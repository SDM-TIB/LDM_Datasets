To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "ZS-SLR: Zero-Shot Sign Language Recognition from RGB-D Videos" by Razieh Rastgoo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their model on four datasets, which is a strong indication that I need to find details about these datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **results section**. In this paper, the authors provide a table (Table I) that lists the datasets used for evaluation, which includes:

1. **Montalbano II**: The paper states that this dataset contains 12,575 samples and has 20 classes, and it is of type RGB-D.
2. **MSR Daily Activity 3D**: This dataset has 320 samples, 16 classes, and is also RGB-D.
3. **CAD-60**: This dataset includes 60 samples, 12 classes, and is RGB-D.
4. **NTU-60**: This dataset has 56,000 samples, 60 classes, and is RGB-D.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **Montalbano II**, the citation is:
  > Escalera, S., Gonzalez, J., Baro, X., Reyes, M., Lopes, O., Guyon, I., Athitsos, V., & Escalante, H. (2013). Multi-modal gesture recognition challenge 2013: dataset and results. In Proceedings of the 15th ACM on International conference on multi-modal interaction (pp. 445–452).

- For **MSR Daily Activity 3D**, the citation is:

- For **CAD-60**, the citation is:
  > Sung, J., Ponce, C., Selman, B., & Saxena, A. (2012). Unstructured human activity detection from RGBD images. In IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (pp. 2012).

- For **NTU-60**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its respective citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
