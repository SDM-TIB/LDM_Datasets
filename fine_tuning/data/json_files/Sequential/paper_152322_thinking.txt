To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contextual LSTM (CLSTM) models for Large scale NLP tasks" by Shalini Ghosh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their CLSTM model on two large-scale document corpora: English documents from Wikipedia and a snapshot of English Google News. This suggests that these two datasets are crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly the **experiments** or **datasets** sections. In the paper, the authors mention that they used the entire English corpus from Wikipedia, which they divided into training, validation, and test sets. They also provide statistics about the number of documents, paragraphs, sentences, and words in each subset.

The relevant datasets identified are:

1. **Wikipedia Dataset**: The authors used the entire English Wikipedia corpus from a snapshot dated 2014/09/17, which consists of 4.7 million documents. They divided this dataset into 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing.

2. **Google News Dataset**: The authors also used a recent snapshot of the English Google News corpus, consisting of 4.3 million documents, which they similarly divided into training, validation, and test sets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are widely known and do not have specific papers associated with them, I will provide a general citation format for each dataset:

- For the **Wikipedia Dataset**, I will cite it as:
  > Wikimedia Foundation. *Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopedia*. [https://www.wikipedia.org](https://www.wikipedia.org).

- For the **Google News Dataset**, I will cite it as:
  > Google Inc. *Google News*. [https://news.google.com](https://news.google.com).

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all necessary information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
