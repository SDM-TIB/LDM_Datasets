To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simplified Long Short-term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks: part I" by Atra Akandeh and Fathi M. Salem, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their models on the **MNIST dataset**, which is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition. This is a strong indication that I should focus on this dataset.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** to confirm the use of the MNIST dataset. In the experiments, the authors state that they trained and evaluated all models on the benchmark **MNIST dataset** using images formatted in sequence mappings. This confirms that the MNIST dataset is indeed the dataset used for their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a widely used dataset, and its citation is typically well-known. The original citation for the MNIST dataset is:

- For **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digit Images*. 1998.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will focus solely on the MNIST dataset for my extraction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for the MNIST dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will be ready for review or further processing.
