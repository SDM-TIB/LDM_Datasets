To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analyzing vehicle-pedestrian interactions: combining data cube structure and predictive collision risk estimation model" by Byeongjoon Noh et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses video footage from CCTV cameras in Osan City, which suggests that there is a dataset related to vehicle-pedestrian interactions.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.2 (Data sources and preprocessing)**, where the authors describe the data collection process. They mention that the datasets are based on video footage from CCTV cameras provided by the Osan Smart City Integrated Operations Center. The authors collected videos from nine crosswalks over 14 weekdays, which gives me specific details about the dataset.

In this section, the authors also provide a summary of the data collected, stating that they obtained **45,890 scenes** with movements of traffic-related objects. This indicates a large dataset that is crucial for their analysis.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets used. However, since the datasets are derived from the authors' own video footage and not from previously published datasets, there may not be formal citations for them. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper.

The key dataset I will extract is:

1. **CCTV Video Footage Dataset**: This dataset consists of video footage collected from CCTV cameras at nine different crosswalks in Osan City, Republic of Korea, over a period of 14 weekdays. The dataset includes various scenes of vehicle-pedestrian interactions, with a total of 45,890 scenes recorded.

Since the dataset is primarily based on the authors' own collection and processing of video footage, I will summarize the details without a formal citation but will ensure to mention the source as the Osan Smart City Integrated Operations Center.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the relevant details, ensuring that I capture the essence of the dataset as described in the paper.
