To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automated Vulnerability Detection in Source Code Using Quantum Natural Language Processing" by Mst Shapna Akter et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors assembled a sizable dataset of millions of open-source functions for vulnerability detection, which suggests that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically **section 3.1 (Dataset Specification)**, where the authors describe the dataset they compiled. They mention that they analyzed software packages at the function level and compiled a vast dataset of millions of function-level examples of C and C++ code from three sources:

1. **SATE IV Juliet Test Suite**: This is a well-known dataset used for evaluating static analysis tools and vulnerability detection methods.
2. **Debian Linux distribution**: This refers to the open-source software distribution that includes a variety of packages, which likely contains vulnerable code examples.
3. **Public Git repositories on GitHub**: This indicates that the authors collected data from publicly available repositories, which may include various open-source projects.

The authors also mention that they used the **CWE-119 vulnerability feature**, which is related to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. This is important context for understanding the nature of the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the following:

- For the **SATE IV Juliet Test Suite**, the citation is:
  > Russell, R., Kim, L., Hamilton, L., Lazovich, T., Harer, J., Ozdemir, O., Ellingwood, P., & McConley, M. (2018). Automated vulnerability detection in source code using deep representation learning. In *2018 17th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA)* (pp. 757â€“762). IEEE.

- For the **CWE-119**, the citation is:
  > Common Weakness Enumeration. (2019). CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer. Retrieved from https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html.

- The **Debian Linux distribution** does not have a specific citation in the paper, but it is a well-known open-source project. A general reference can be made to the Debian project website.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for review or further processing.
