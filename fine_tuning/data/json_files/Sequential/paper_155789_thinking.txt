To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Blue Communications for Edge Computing: the Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces Opportunity" by Fatima Ezzahra Airod et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of reconfugurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and multi-access edge computing (MEC) but does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** (if available) to see if the authors describe any datasets used for simulations or evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention numerical simulations in the **numerical results section**, where they provide specific parameters and scenarios for their experiments. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets.

Since the paper focuses on theoretical modeling and simulations rather than empirical data collection from specific datasets, I will check the **references section** for any cited datasets or related works that may have provided data. The references include various studies and papers, but they do not seem to point to specific datasets used in this research.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets for their experiments. Instead, they conducted simulations based on theoretical models and parameters. Therefore, I will not be able to extract any datasets or citations for datasets from this paper.

In conclusion, while I have thoroughly searched the paper for datasets, it seems that the authors did not rely on external datasets but rather on their own simulations and theoretical constructs. I will document this finding accordingly, noting that no datasets were extracted from this research paper.
