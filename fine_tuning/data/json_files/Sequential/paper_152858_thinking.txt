To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Distilling Task-Specific Knowledge from BERT into Simple Neural Networks" by Raphael Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their approach across multiple datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three specific datasets:

1. **SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank 2)**: This dataset is used for binary sentiment classification and consists of single sentences extracted from movie reviews. The authors note that they only consider sentence-level sentiment for their experiments.

2. **MNLI (Multi-genre Natural Language Inference)**: This is a large-scale dataset for entailment classification, where the goal is to predict the relationship between pairs of sentences. The authors specify that they use both MNLI-m (matched) and MNLI-mm (mismatched) versions.

3. **QQP (Quora Question Pairs)**: This dataset consists of pairs of potentially duplicate questions collected from Quora, with a binary label indicating whether the questions are redundant.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **SST-2**, the citation is:
  > Socher, Richard, Cliff C. Lin, Chris Manning, and Andrew Y Ng. *Parsing natural scenes and natural language with recursive neural networks*. In Proceedings of the 28th international conference on machine learning (ICML-11), pages 129â€“136, 2011.

- For **MNLI**, the citation is:
  > Williams, Adina, Nikita Nangia, and Samuel R. Bowman. *A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference*. arXiv:1704.05426, 2017.

- For **QQP**, the citation is:
  > Iyer, Shankar, and Csernai, Kornl. *First Quora dataset release: Question pairs*. 2017.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
