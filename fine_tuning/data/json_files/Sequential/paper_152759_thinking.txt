To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GCN-GAN: A Non-linear Temporal Link Prediction Model for Weighted Dynamic Networks" by Kai Lei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on **four datasets of different network systems**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** in the paper, which is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this case, I find that the authors have included a section labeled **A. Datasets**.

In this section, the authors list the datasets as follows:

1. **UCSB**: A link quality dataset of a wireless mesh network.
2. **NumFabric**: A simulation flow dataset of a data center.
3. **KAIST**: A human mobility position dataset.
4. **BJ-Taxi**: A vehicle mobility position dataset.

Each dataset is accompanied by a brief description, which helps in understanding the context of their use.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **UCSB**:
  > K. Ramachandran, I. Sheriff, E. Belding, and K. Almeroth. "Routing stability in static wireless mesh networks." In *Passive and Active Measurement Conference*, Louvain-La-Neuve, Belgium, April 2007, pp. 73–82.

- For **NumFabric**:
  > K. Nagaraj, D. Bharadia, H. Mao, S. Chinchali, M. Alizadeh, and S. Katti. "Numfabric: Fast and flexible bandwidth allocation in data-centers." In *Conference on ACM SIGCOMM 2016 Conference*, 2016, pp. 188–201.

- For **KAIST**:
  > K. Lee, S. Hong, S. J. Kim, and I. Rhee. "Slaw: A new mobility model for human walks." In *INFOCOM*, 2009, pp. 855–863.

- For **BJ-Taxi**:
  > J. Yuan, Y. Zheng, X. Xie, and G. Sun. "Driving with knowledge from the physical world." In *ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining*, 2011, pp. 316–324.

With this information, I have successfully identified and extracted the datasets along with their full citations. I will now compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
