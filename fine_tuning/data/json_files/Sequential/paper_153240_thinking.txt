To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluation Benchmarks and Learning Criteria for Discourse-Aware Sentence Representations" by Mingda Chen, Zewei Chu, and Kevin Gimpel, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a new evaluation suite called **DiscoEval**, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section** where the authors describe the tasks and datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention two human-annotated datasets:

1. **RST Discourse Treebank (RST-DT)**: This dataset is used for predicting annotated discourse relations among sentences. It contains various coarse-grained relations such as Attribution, Background, Cause, Comparison, and others.

2. **Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB)**: This dataset is also used for predicting discourse relations, with different labeling schemes for explicit and implicit relations.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm that these datasets were indeed used in their evaluations. The authors provide a table summarizing the sizes of the datasets used in DiscoEval, which includes the RST-DT and PDTB datasets.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For **RST Discourse Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Lynn Carlson, Daniel Marcu, and Mary Ellen Okurowsky. *Building a discourse-tagged corpus in the framework of rhetorical structure theory*. In Proceedings of the Second SIGdial Workshop on Discourse and Dialogue, 2001.

- For **Penn Discourse Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Rashmi Prasad, Nikhil Dinesh, Alan Lee, Eleni Miltsakaki, Livio Robaldo, Aravind Joshi, and Bonnie Webber. *The Penn Discourse Treebank 2.0*. In Proceedings of LREC, 2008.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for further processing.
