To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Full Attention Bidirectional Deep Learning Structure for Single Channel Speech Enhancement" by Yu-Zi Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview, but the results section is likely where the datasets are explicitly mentioned. 

In **section 3 (Results)**, the authors state that they tested their speech enhancement method on two free speech databases: **THCHS-30** and **QUT-NOISE-TIMIT**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the study.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in **section 3.1 (Datasets)**. Here, the authors provide specific information about each dataset:

1. **THCHS-30**: This is a free Chinese speech database that contains over 30 hours of clean speech signals recorded under various noise conditions. The authors mention that they created additional noise conditions by mixing car noise and cafeteria noise, with signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) ranging from -10 dB to 10 dB.

2. **QUT-NOISE-TIMIT**: This dataset is synthesized by mixing five different background noise sources with the TIMIT dataset. The training set uses SNR data ranging from -5 dB to 5 dB, while the evaluation set contains SNR ranging from -10 dB to 15 dB. The total length of the training and test data corresponds to 25 hours and 12 hours, respectively.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **THCHS-30**, the citation is:
  > D. Wang and X. Zhang, “THCHS-30: A free Chinese speech corpus,” arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.01882, 2015.

- For **QUT-NOISE-TIMIT**, the citation is:
  > D. B. Dean, S. Sridharan, R. J. Vogt, and M. W. Mason, “The QUT-NOISE-TIMIT corpus for the evaluation of voice activity detection algorithms,” Proc. INTERSPEECH, pp. 3110–3113, 2010.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets and their citations. I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described, including its purpose and the context in which it was used in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are captured accurately.
