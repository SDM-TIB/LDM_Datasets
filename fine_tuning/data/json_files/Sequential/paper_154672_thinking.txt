To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HIVE-COTE 2.0: a new meta ensemble for time series classification" by Matthew Middlehurst et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that HIVE-COTE 2.0 is evaluated on "112 univariate UCR archive datasets and 26 multivariate UEA archive datasets." This indicates that both the UCR and UEA archives are significant datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, likely in the **experiments** or **methodology** sections. In this paper, the authors mention the UCR time series classification archive and the UEA multivariate time series classification archive. 

In the **experimental structure** section, the authors specify that they performed experiments on "112 of the 128 datasets from the UCR time series archive" and "all 26 equal length datasets of the 30 total from the UEA multivariate time series archive." This confirms the datasets used for their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **references section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **UCR Time Series Classification Archive**:
   > Dau H, Bagnall A, Kamgar K, Yeh M, Zhu Y, Gharghabi S, Ratanamahatana C, Chotirat A, Keogh E. *The UCR time series archive*. IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica 6(6):1293â€“1305, 2019.

2. **UEA Multivariate Time Series Classification Archive**:
   > Bagnall A, Dau H, Lines J, Flynn M, Large J, Bostrom A, Southam P, Keogh E. *The UEA multivariate time series classification archive, 2018*. ArXiv e-prints arXiv:1811.00075, 2018.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- UCR Time Series Classification Archive
- UEA Multivariate Time Series Classification Archive

I will ensure that the full citations for each dataset are included in the final output.
