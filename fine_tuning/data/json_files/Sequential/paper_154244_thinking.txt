To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Smaller World Models for Reinforcement Learning" by Jan Robine et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions applying the method on **36 Atari environments**, which suggests that these environments may serve as datasets for the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **evaluation section** in detail, where the authors provide a table comparing their method with others across various Atari games. This table lists the games used, which are likely the datasets for their experiments. The games mentioned include titles like **Alien, Freeway, Gravitar, Hero**, and many others.

I will compile a list of these Atari environments as datasets. Each environment will be treated as a separate dataset entry. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. Since these Atari environments are well-known, I will refer to the original sources or authoritative references for these datasets. The Atari games are typically associated with the **Atari Learning Environment** and can be cited as follows:

- For the **Atari Learning Environment**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Munos, R. (2013). The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

Now, I will create entries for each dataset based on the Atari environments listed in the evaluation section, ensuring to include the citation for the Atari Learning Environment for each game.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
