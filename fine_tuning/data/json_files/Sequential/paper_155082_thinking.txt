To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Streaming Transformer Transducer Based Speech Recognition Using Non-Causal Convolution" by Yangyang Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses improvements in speech recognition but does not specify datasets. However, the introduction mentions that the authors evaluated their methods on a large-scale speech recognition dataset composed of two scenarios, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors describe their data. In **Section 3.1 (Data)**, they provide detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation:

1. **Training Data**: The authors describe a large-scale speech recognition dataset composed of two scenarios:
   - **Assistant Scenario**: This includes 13K hours of recordings from third-party vendors, 1.3K hours of voice commands from production, and 4K hours of speech generated by an in-house TTS model.
   - **Open Domain Dictation**: This consists of 18K hours of human transcribed data from videos and 2M hours of unlabeled videos transcribed by a high-quality in-house model.

2. **Evaluation Data**: The evaluation datasets mentioned are:
   - **assi**: 13.6K manually transcribed utterances from in-house volunteer employees.
   - **call**: A dataset of utterances starting with a wake word.
   - **dict**: 8 hours of open domain dictation recorded via mobile devices.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets that are referenced. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets used in the experiments, as they are described as in-house data or proprietary datasets.

Since the datasets are not attributed to external sources, I will note that the training and evaluation datasets are primarily in-house and do not have formal citations. However, I will still document the datasets as follows:

- **Training Data**: Large-scale speech recognition dataset composed of:
  - Assistant scenario: 13K hours of recordings, 1.3K hours of voice commands, and 4K hours of TTS-generated speech.
  - Open domain dictation: 18K hours of human transcribed data and 2M hours of unlabeled videos.

- **Evaluation Data**:
  - Assi: 13.6K manually transcribed utterances.
  - Call: Dataset of utterances starting with a wake word.
  - Dict: 8 hours of open domain dictation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I highlight the proprietary nature of the datasets and the lack of formal citations for them.
