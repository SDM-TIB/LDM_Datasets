To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inducing Distant Supervision in Suggestion Mining through Part-of-Speech Embeddings" by Sapna Negi and Paul Buitelaar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a large silver standard dataset called the **Wiki Suggestion dataset**, which is constructed from sentences extracted from wikiHow and Wikipedia. This suggests that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their work. Here, they mention two types of datasets: **gold standard datasets** and the **Wiki Suggestion dataset**. 

1. **Gold Standard Datasets**: The authors refer to datasets provided by Negi et al. (2016), which include sentences labeled as suggestions and non-suggestions from various domains such as hotel reviews and travel discussion forums. They specifically mention using a hotel review dataset for training and testing.

2. **Wiki Suggestion Dataset**: This dataset is described as a silver standard dataset created from wikiHow and Wikipedia. The authors explain that it contains 675,851 sentences extracted from wikiHow's tips and warnings sections and an equal number of sentences from Wikipedia for negative instances. This dataset is significant as it addresses the lack of large hand-labeled datasets for suggestion mining.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **gold standard datasets** referenced from Negi et al.:
  > Sapna Negi, Kartik Asooja, Shubham Mehrotra, and Paul Buitelaar. *A Study of Suggestions in Opinionated Texts and their Automatic Detection*. In Proceedings of the Fifth Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics, 2016.

- For the **Wiki Suggestion dataset**, since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:
  > Sapna Negi and Paul Buitelaar. *Inducing Distant Supervision in Suggestion Mining through Part-of-Speech Embeddings*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
