To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Supervised Symbolic Music Style Translation Using Synthetic Data" by Ondřej Cífka, Umut Şimşekli, and Gaël Richard, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a synthetic data generation scheme to produce aligned data for music style translation, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Synthetic Data Generation)**, where the authors describe their approach to creating a synthetic dataset. They mention that they generated a dataset using the Band-in-a-Box (BIAB) software package. Specifically, they downloaded chord charts of around 3.5K songs in the BIAB format from an online archive and used BIAB to create arrangements in different styles. This section provides crucial details about the dataset.

I will also look for any specific names or identifiers for the dataset. The authors state that they generated around 658K training examples from 2,809 songs, which is significant information about the dataset size and composition.

In **section 6 (Experimental Results)**, the authors mention evaluating their model on the Bodhidharma MIDI dataset, which is a diverse collection of MIDI recordings annotated with genre labels. This indicates that the Bodhidharma dataset is also relevant to their research.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: The authors created this dataset using the Band-in-a-Box software, but since it is a synthetic dataset generated from existing songs, it does not have a formal citation. However, I will note that it is based on the following source:
   > Band-in-a-Box. PG Music Inc. https://www.pgmusic.com/.

2. **Bodhidharma MIDI Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Cory McKay and Ichiro Fujinaga. *The Bodhidharma system and the results of the MIREX 2005 symbolic genre classification contest*. In ISMIR, 2005.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
