To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Voice: Real-time Neural Text-to-Speech" by Sercan O. ArÄ±k et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that they present a text-to-speech system and refer to training on an internal English speech database and a subset of the Blizzard 2013 dataset. This indicates that there are at least two datasets to look for.

Next, I will examine the **results section** (specifically section 4) to gather more details about the datasets used. In section 4.0, the authors state that they trained their models on an internal English speech database containing approximately 20 hours of speech data segmented into 13,079 utterances. They also mention using a subset of the Blizzard 2013 dataset for audio synthesis results.

In section 4.5, they provide more context about the Blizzard dataset, indicating that they retrained their models with identical hyperparameters on this dataset, which contains 20.5 hours of speech data segmented into 9,741 utterances. 

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. 

1. For the **internal English speech database**, since it is an internal dataset, it may not have a formal citation. However, I will note its description for completeness.

2. For the **Blizzard 2013 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Prahallad, Kishore, Vadapalli, Anandaswarup, Elluru, Naresh, et al. "The Blizzard Challenge 2013 Indian Language Task." In Blizzard Challenge Workshop 2013, 2013.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Internal English Speech Database**: Contains approximately 20 hours of speech data segmented into 13,079 utterances. (No formal citation available)
  
- **Blizzard 2013 Dataset**: A dataset used for speech synthesis, containing 20.5 hours of speech data segmented into 9,741 utterances.
  
Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
