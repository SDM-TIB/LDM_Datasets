To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Long-Horizon Forecasts with Expectation-Biased LSTM Networks" by Aya Abdelsalam Ismail et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper explores long-horizon forecasting using datasets from neuroscience and energy supply management, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation methods. In this section, they mention using two publicly available datasets:

1. **ADNI Dataset**: This dataset is used to predict changes in ventricular volume over time, specifically in the context of Alzheimer's Disease. The authors note that this dataset was part of the TADPOLE challenge, which provides a clear reference point for its citation.

2. **Electricity Consumption Dataset**: This dataset contains monthly electricity consumption data across the United States, along with features such as population count, price of kilowatt hours, and average temperature. The authors specify that the data was obtained from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) and NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI).

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **ADNI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. *ADNI Database*. Retrieved from http://adni.loni.usc.edu.

- For the **Electricity Consumption Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Energy Information Administration. *Annual Energy Outlook*. Official Energy Statistics from the US Government. Retrieved from www.eia.doe.gov.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
