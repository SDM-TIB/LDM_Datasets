To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention Augmented ConvLSTM for Environment Prediction" by Bernard Lange, Masha Itkina, and Mykel J. Kochenderfer, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors demonstrate improved performance on the **real-world KITTI and Waymo datasets**, indicating that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors explicitly state that they evaluate their proposed methods on the **KITTI dataset** and the **Waymo Open Dataset**. This confirms that both datasets are used for their experiments.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

For the **KITTI dataset**, the citation is:
> A. Geiger, P. Lenz, C. Stiller, and R. Urtasun. *Vision meets robotics: The KITTI Dataset*. International Journal of Robotics Research, 2013.

For the **Waymo Open Dataset**, the citation is:
> P. Sun, H. Kretzschmar, X. Dotiwalla, A. Chouard, V. Patnaik, P. Tsui, J. Guo, Y. Zhou, Y. Chai, B. Caine, et al. *Scalability in perception for autonomous driving: Waymo Open Dataset*. In Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), IEEE, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation.
