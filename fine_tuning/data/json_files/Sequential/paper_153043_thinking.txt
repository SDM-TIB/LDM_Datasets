To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Effectiveness of Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging and Deep Neural Networks for Detecting Known and Unknown Fingerprint Presentation Attacks" by Hengameh Mirzaalian et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation benchmark sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted a comprehensive study using a new large dataset, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Evaluation Benchmark)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the dataset consists of **3743 bona fide samples** collected from **335 unique subjects**, along with **218 presentation attack samples** that include six different types of attacks. This section provides a clear overview of the dataset's composition.

The authors also provide a breakdown of the different types of presentation attacks in **Table 1**, which lists the number of samples for each attack type. This table is crucial for understanding the dataset's diversity and the specific challenges it addresses.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the dataset is newly created for this study, it may not have a separate citation in the references. Instead, I will note that the dataset is described in detail within the paper itself.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: LSCI Fingerprint Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset consisting of 3961 LSCI images (3743 bona fide and 218 presentation attack cases) collected from 335 unique subjects, including six different attack types (conductive paper, conductive silicone, transparency, silicone-I, silicone-II, and dragon-skin).

Since there are no external citations for this dataset, I will ensure to mention that it is a novel dataset introduced in this paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I highlight the importance of the dataset's details as presented in the paper.
