To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards lifelong learning of Recurrent Neural Networks for control design" by Fabio Bonassi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed method to a simulated chemical plant, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to this simulation.

Next, I will focus on **Section III (Simulation Example)**, where the authors describe the application of their method to a chemical benchmark system. Here, they mention that the LSTM network was trained on a total of 136 input-output sequences collected from the simulated system, which indicates that there is a dataset involved.

In this section, the authors provide details about the chemical benchmark system, including the parameters and the structure of the LSTM network used for modeling. They also mention that 100 sequences were used for training and 36 for testing, which gives me specific numbers to include in the dataset description.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets used. The authors refer to previous works that describe the chemical benchmark system, which may provide the necessary citations for the dataset.

The relevant datasets I will extract are:

1. **Chemical Benchmark Dataset**: This dataset consists of 136 input-output sequences collected from a simulated chemical plant, with 100 sequences used for training and 36 for testing.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the chemical benchmark system, which is referenced in the paper. The citation is:

- For the chemical benchmark system, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will allow for accurate documentation and future reference.
