To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prediction of Temperature and Rainfall in Bangladesh using Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks" by Mohammad Mahmudur Rahman Khan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study analyzes 115 years of weather data from Bangladesh, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically subsection A titled "Data." Here, the authors explicitly mention that they collected the monthly average temperature and rainfall data for 115 years from a Kaggle public domain dataset called the "Bangladesh Weather Dataset." This is a clear identification of the dataset used in the study.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the "Bangladesh Weather Dataset." The reference is provided as a URL, which is important for proper citation. The dataset is referenced as follows:

- **Bangladesh Weather Dataset**: 
  > "No Title." https://www.kaggle.com/yakinrubaiat/bangladesh-weather-dataset.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Bangladesh Weather Dataset**: This dataset contains monthly average temperature and rainfall data for Bangladesh from January 1901 to December 2015. It is used to forecast monthwise temperature and rainfall using an LSTM model.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that the dataset extraction is complete and ready for further processing or review.
