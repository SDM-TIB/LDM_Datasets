To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Prediction of Blood Lactate Values in Critically Ill Patients: A Retrospective Multi-center Cohort Study" by Behrooz Mamandipoor et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention using the **MIMIC-III** and **eICU-CRD** datasets for their analysis, which indicates that these are the primary datasets of interest.

Next, I will look closely at the **methods section**, particularly the **Data Sources** subsection, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. Here, they describe the **MIMIC-III** dataset as a longitudinal database containing data from 53,423 ICU admissions at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and the **eICU-CRD** as a database with data from 200,859 admissions across 335 ICUs in the US.

I will also check the **results section** to confirm that these datasets were indeed used for the analysis and to see if any additional details about their use are provided. The authors discuss the performance of their models using these datasets, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **references section** of the paper:

1. **MIMIC-III Dataset**:
   > Johnson, A. E. W., Pollard, T. J., Raffa, J. D., Celi, L. A., Mark, R. G., & Badawi, O. (2016). MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database. *Scientific Data*, 3, 160035. doi:10.1038/sdata.2016.35.

2. **eICU-CRD Dataset**:
   > Pollard, T. J., Johnson, A. E. W., Raffa, J. D., Celi, L. A., Mark, R. G., & Badawi, O. (2018). The eICU Collaborative Research Database, a freely available multi-center database for critical care research. *Scientific Data*, 5(1), 180178. doi:10.1038/sdata.2018.178.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **MIMIC-III Dataset**: A longitudinal database containing data from 53,423 distinct ICU admissions for adult patients at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
- **eICU-CRD Dataset**: A multi-center database containing data associated with 200,859 admissions collected from 335 ICUs across the US.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
