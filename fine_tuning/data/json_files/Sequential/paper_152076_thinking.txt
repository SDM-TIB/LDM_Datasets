To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MIDINET: A Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network for Symbolic-Domain Music Generation" by Li-Chia Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted a user study comparing melodies generated by their model and Google's MelodyRNN, which suggests that they used specific datasets for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Implementation)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for training MidiNet. They mention that they crawled a collection of **1,022 MIDI tabs of pop music from TheoryTab**, which is specifically designed for melody generation. This dataset is crucial for understanding the model's training process.

The authors further explain that they filtered out MIDI tabs containing chords other than the 24 basic chord triads and segmented the remaining tabs into 8-bar segments. They ended up with **526 MIDI tabs (4,208 bars)** after preprocessing, which they augmented to create a final dataset of **50,496 bars of melody and chord pairs**.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The dataset is derived from TheoryTab, so I will cite it as follows:

- For the **TheoryTab dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hooktheory. *TheoryTab: A collection of MIDI tabs for pop music*. Available at: https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab (accessed 2023).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will allow for proper attribution and facilitate further research or verification by others.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference.
