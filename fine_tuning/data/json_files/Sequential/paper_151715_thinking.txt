To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LSTMs Exploit Linguistic Attributes of Data" by Nelson F. Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the investigation of LSTMs using various types of data, which suggests that datasets are involved. The introduction elaborates on the properties of natural language data and hints at different training regimens, indicating that multiple datasets may be used.

Next, I will focus on the **Datasets section** (section 3) where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they outline several training data distributions for the memorization task:

1. **Uniform Setup**: This dataset is generated by randomly sampling tokens from a uniform distribution over a fixed vocabulary.

2. **Unigram Setup**: This dataset is derived from the Penn Treebank, modified to integrate Zipfian token frequencies, with tokens randomly permuted.

3. **5gram, 10gram, and 50gram Settings**: These datasets are created by grouping tokens from the Penn Treebank into chunks of 5, 10, or 50 tokens, respectively, and then randomly permuting these chunks.

4. **Language Setup**: This dataset uses real language sequences from the Penn Treebank, incorporating the structural properties of natural language.

I will then confirm the use of these datasets in the **Results section** where the authors discuss the performance of LSTMs trained on each dataset, reinforcing that these datasets were indeed utilized in their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The Penn Treebank is cited as follows:

- For the **Penn Treebank**:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their authoritative references.
