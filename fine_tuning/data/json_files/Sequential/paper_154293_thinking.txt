To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learnability and Complexity of Quantum Samples" by Murphy Yuezhen Niu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used for experiments. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets, which can help identify them.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. This section is crucial as it usually contains specific information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, I notice that the authors mention two types of quantum samples: **experimental quantum samples** and **theoretical quantum samples**. They also refer to classical distributions, specifically the **Porter-Thomas distribution** and its variations. I will need to extract details about these datasets.

1. **Experimental Quantum Samples**: The authors state that these samples are obtained from running random quantum circuits on a laboratory quantum computer. They mention that the data is publicly available, which is important for citation.

2. **Theoretical Quantum Samples**: These samples are generated through simulations of quantum circuits. The authors provide a reference to the specific quantum circuit used, which is essential for proper citation.

3. **Porter-Thomas Distribution**: The authors define this distribution and its variations, which are used as benchmarks for their experiments. I will need to ensure that I capture the relevant details about how these distributions are generated and their significance in the context of the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for any datasets or papers referenced in relation to the datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution.

For example, the citation for the experimental quantum samples might refer to the original paper that introduced the quantum circuit used, while the theoretical samples might reference the simulation methods employed.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further research or replication of the study.
