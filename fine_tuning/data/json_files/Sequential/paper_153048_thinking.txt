To extract datasets from the research paper titled "One-Shot Neural Architecture Search via Compressive Sensing" by Minsu Cho et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their approach on several standard test datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for evaluation. In **Section 4.1 (CIFAR-10)**, they detail their architecture search process and mention that they used the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for training and validation. This dataset is a well-known benchmark in the field of machine learning.

In **Section 4.2 (Penn Treebank)**, the authors discuss their experiments on recurrent neural networks and specify that they used the **Penn Treebank (PTB)** dataset for language modeling tasks. This is another established dataset commonly used in natural language processing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset of images*. 2009. [Online]. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

- For the **Penn Treebank dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marcus, Mitchell P., Beatrice Santorini, and Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz. *Building a Large Annotated Corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2):313-330, 1993.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing.
