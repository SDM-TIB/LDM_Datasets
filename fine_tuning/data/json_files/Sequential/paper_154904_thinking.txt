To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Deep Anomaly Detection for Multi-Sensor Time-Series Signals" by Yuxin Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of multi-sensor technologies in various fields, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **PAMAP2 Dataset**: This dataset is described as a mobile dataset containing data from 18 different physical activities performed by 9 subjects using 3 inertial measurement units. 

2. **CAP Sleep Database**: This clinical dataset includes periodic physiological signals from healthy subjects and patients diagnosed with various sleep disorders. 

3. **Mental Fatigue Dataset**: This dataset consists of physiological signals collected from healthy subjects to detect mental fatigue.

I will then confirm the details of these datasets by cross-referencing them in the **experiments section** where the authors discuss their methodology and results. This will help ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **PAMAP2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Reiss and D. Stricker. "Introducing a new benchmarked dataset for activity monitoring." In 2012 16th International Symposium on Wearable Computers, IEEE, 2012, pp. 108–109.

- For the **CAP Sleep Database**, the citation is:
  > M. G. Terzano et al. "Atlas, rules, and recording techniques for the scoring of cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) in human sleep." Sleep medicine, vol. 3, no. 2, pp. 187–199, 2002.

- For the **Mental Fatigue Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. Zhang, Y. Chen, and Z. Pan. "A deep temporal model for mental fatigue detection." In 2018 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC), IEEE, 2018, pp. 1879–1884.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference or analysis.
