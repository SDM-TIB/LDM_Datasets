To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Pointer Net Parsing" by Linlin Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on standard benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention evaluating their model on the **English Penn Treebank (PTB v3.0)** and the **RST Discourse Treebank (RST-DT)**. I will note down the details provided for each dataset.

For the **English Penn Treebank**, the authors state that it was converted to Stanford Dependencies format using the Stanford Dependency Converter. This dataset is crucial for dependency parsing tasks.

For the **RST Discourse Treebank**, the authors mention that it contains discourse annotations for 385 news articles from the Penn Treebank. This dataset is essential for discourse parsing tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **English Penn Treebank (PTB v3.0)**, the citation is:
   > Marcus, M., Marcinkiewicz, M., & Santorini, B. (1994). Building a Large Annotated Corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313-330.

2. For the **RST Discourse Treebank (RST-DT)**, the citation is:
   > Carlson, L., Marcu, D., & Okurowski, M. E. (2002). RST Discourse Treebank (RSTâ€“DT) LDC2002T07. Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
