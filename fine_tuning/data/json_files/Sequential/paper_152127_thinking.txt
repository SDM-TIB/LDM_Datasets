To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unbiased Online Recurrent Optimization" by Corentin Tallec and Yann Ollivier, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced or implied. The abstract discusses the UORO algorithm and its advantages over traditional methods, but it does not mention specific datasets. The introduction may provide context or examples that could hint at datasets used in experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically described. In this paper, the authors conduct experiments on synthetic tasks and specific datasets. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they are utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the experiments, I find that the authors mention two specific datasets:

1. **Distant Brackets Dataset**: This dataset is generated by outputting a left bracket, followed by random characters, a right bracket, and then repeating the first set of characters. The dataset is designed to test the model's ability to understand nested structures.

2. **anbn(k, l) Dataset**: This dataset tests memory and counting by generating strings of 'a's followed by 'b's, where the number of 'a's and 'b's must match. The dataset is crucial for evaluating the model's performance in understanding temporal dependencies.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, since these datasets are synthetic and generated for the purpose of the experiments, they may not have formal citations like established datasets. Instead, I will note the descriptions provided in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their use in the experiments. Since these datasets are not from external sources, I will focus on the descriptions provided in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that I have accurately captured the essence of each dataset and its relevance to the research conducted in the paper. This will prepare me for any further processing or presentation of the extracted dataset information.
