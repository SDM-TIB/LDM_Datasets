To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Attention Free Conditional Autoencoder For Anomaly Detection in Cryptocurrencies" by Hugo Inzirillo and Ludovic De Villelongue, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets section** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but the **datasets section** is likely where the authors will detail the datasets used for their analysis.

In **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors describe their dataset as follows: they use one year of hourly data from **20 cryptocurrencies**, retrieving OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) and volume data from **CryptoCompare**. They also calculate five indicators using the **Pandas TA** library. This section indicates that the dataset is derived from a specific source and includes calculated features.

Next, I will note the specific components of the dataset:
- The dataset consists of hourly data for **20 cryptocurrencies**.
- It includes OHLC and volume data.
- Five indicators are calculated: SMA, DEMA, CCI, AD, and ATR.
- The dataset also includes the time-varying hurst exponent and returns.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** for the source of the cryptocurrency data. The authors mention using **CryptoCompare** for retrieving the data, but I need to ensure I have the correct citation format. I will check the references section for any mention of CryptoCompare or related datasets.

In the **References section**, I find that the authors do not provide a specific citation for CryptoCompare. However, I can reference it as follows:
> CryptoCompare. *Cryptocurrency Market Data*. Available at: https://www.cryptocompare.com/

For the **Pandas TA** library, I will also look for its citation. It is not explicitly mentioned in the references, but I can cite it as:
> Pandas TA. *Technical Analysis Library in Python*. Available at: https://github.com/gbeced/pyti

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citations for both CryptoCompare and Pandas TA.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring that I have captured all relevant details and citations accurately.
