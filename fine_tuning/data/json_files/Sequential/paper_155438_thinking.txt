To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Approach to Predicting News â”€ A Precise Multi-LSTM Network With BERT" by Chia-Lin Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a corpus containing **28,358 news articles** and **200 news articles** scraped from the **Liberty Times Net (LTN)** website, categorized into 8 distinct categories. This suggests that the LTN dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will examine the **model and experiment** sections, particularly focusing on the descriptions of the datasets used. The authors mention that the corpus consists of news articles categorized into the following 8 categories: Technology, Entertainment, Fashion, Politics, Sports, International, Finance, and Health. This categorization is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail the two corpora they utilized:
1. **Corpus of 28,358 news articles**: This corpus includes a variety of news articles across the 8 categories mentioned.
2. **Corpus of 200 news articles**: This smaller corpus is also categorized into the same 8 categories.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the Liberty Times Net (LTN) dataset. However, since the LTN is a website and not a traditional dataset published in a paper, I will note that it is a source of news articles rather than a formal dataset citation.

The citation for the LTN website is:
> Liberty Times Net. Available at: https://www.ltn.com.tw/

Additionally, I will note that the authors reference BERT and LSTM in their methodology, but these are not datasets; they are models used for processing the text data.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Liberty Times Net (LTN) Dataset**: A collection of news articles scraped from the LTN website, categorized into 8 categories (Technology, Entertainment, Fashion, Politics, Sports, International, Finance, and Health). The dataset includes 28,358 articles and 200 articles for experimentation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
