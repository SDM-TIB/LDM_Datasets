To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Augmentation of Kalman Filter with Hypernetwork for Channel Tracking" by Kumar Pratik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on a **CDL-B channel model**, which suggests that there may be a dataset associated with this model.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. In this case, the **experiments section** provides crucial information about the dataset used for training and testing. The authors mention that they generated a dataset consisting of **15 Doppler values**, which were binned into **5 mutually exclusive bins**. Each bin corresponds to a specific range of Doppler values and includes **800 training channel instances** and **200 test channel instances** per Doppler frequency.

I will summarize the dataset details as follows:

1. **CDL-B Channel Dataset**: This dataset is generated for channel tracking experiments and includes various Doppler values. It consists of 800 training instances and 200 test instances for each of the 15 Doppler frequencies, with each instance being 1500 OFDM symbols long.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CDL-B channel model. The paper cites the **3GPP standard** for the channel model, which is essential for proper attribution.

The citation for the CDL-B channel model is:
> ETSI 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), “Study on channel model for frequency spectrum above 6 GHz,” 3GPP TR 38.900, Jun, Tech. Rep., 2016.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation for the CDL-B channel model.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
