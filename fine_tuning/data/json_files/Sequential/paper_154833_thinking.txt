To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Encoder-Decoder Based Attractors for End-to-End Neural Diarization" by Shota Horiguchi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the paper investigates a method for speaker diarization and references evaluations on various datasets. This indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any subsections that mention datasets. In this paper, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for training and evaluation in **section IV (Experiments)**. They categorize the datasets into simulated and real datasets.

1. **Simulated Datasets**: The authors describe several simulated datasets created from single-speaker recordings, including:
   - **Sim1spk**: 100,000 mixtures for training and 500 for testing.
   - **Sim2spk**: 100,000 mixtures for training and 500 for testing.
   - **Sim3spk**: 100,000 mixtures for training and 500 for testing.
   - **Sim4spk**: 100,000 mixtures for training and 500 for testing.
   - **Sim5spk**: 100,000 mixtures for training and 500 for testing.

2. **Real Datasets**: The authors also mention several real datasets used for evaluation:
   - **CALLHOME**: A dataset consisting of telephone conversations, with specific splits for two and three speakers.
   - **CSJ**: A dataset of Japanese speech dialogues.
   - **AMI headset mix**: A meeting dataset with multi-modal recordings.
   - **DIHARD II**: A dataset used in the second DIHARD challenge.
   - **DIHARD III**: A dataset used in the third DIHARD challenge.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, the citation for the **CALLHOME dataset** is:
> CALLHOME [56]: A dataset that consists of telephone conversations whose average duration is two minutes. 

The citation for the **DIHARD II dataset** is:
> DIHARD II [38]: A dataset used in the second DIHARD challenge.

After compiling the dataset names and their respective citations, I will ensure that each dataset entry is clearly defined, including the number of mixtures, overlap ratios, and any other relevant details mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation for clarity and proper referencing.
