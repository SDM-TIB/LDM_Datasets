To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hypercomplex Neural Network in Time Series Forecasting of Stock Data" by RadosÅ‚aw Kycia and Agnieszka Niemczynowicz, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors used "four related Stock Market time series" for their experiments, which suggests that specific datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they specify the four stock values used for their analysis:

1. **High-Grade Copper (HG=F)**: This dataset represents the price of High-Grade Copper on the COMEX exchange.
2. **Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)**: This dataset corresponds to the stock price of Freeport-McMoRan, the largest copper mining company.
3. **Southern Copper (SCCO)**: This dataset represents the stock price of Southern Copper Company.
4. **Chilean Peso to USD exchange rate (USDCLP=X)**: This dataset reflects the exchange rate between the Chilean Peso and the US Dollar, relevant due to the location of major copper mines in Chile.

The authors mention that the data were gathered from **Yahoo! Finance** for the period from January 1, 2015, to January 1, 2023, and that the final dataset comprises 2008 rows and 4 columns.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are stock prices and exchange rates, they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets. Instead, I will note the source from which the data was obtained:

- For the stock data, the citation is:
  > Yahoo! Finance. *Yahoo! Finance: https://finance.yahoo.com/* (accessed: 10 January 2024).

Since the datasets are derived from publicly available financial data, I will include the source as the citation for each dataset.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the source of the data. Each dataset will be described with its name, a brief description, and the citation.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing.
