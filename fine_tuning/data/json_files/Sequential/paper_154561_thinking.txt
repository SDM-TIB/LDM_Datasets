To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data Engineering for Everyone" by Vijay Janapa Reddi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections discussing datasets** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the importance of open-source datasets in machine learning, which suggests that specific datasets may be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **"Open Data Sets" section** where the authors explicitly mention several datasets. Here, I will identify the datasets discussed:

1. **ImageNet**: The paper states that ImageNet was first released in 2009 and contains 14 million images, which has significantly impacted image classification research.

2. **MS-COCO**: This dataset, first released in 2014, provides 1.5 million object instances for object detection research.

3. **SQuAD**: The Stanford Question Answering Dataset, released in 2016, includes over 100,000 questions for reading comprehension tasks.

4. **People’s Speech**: A dataset being developed by MLCommons, which includes over 87,000 hours of transcribed speech.

5. **1000 Words in 1000 Languages**: This project aims to automate the construction of speech-command datasets for ML-enabled IoT devices.

6. **Common Voice**: An open-source dataset for voice recognition, mentioned in the context of the 1000 Words in 1000 Languages project.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **ImageNet**: 
  > "ImageNet." http://www.image-net.org.

- **MS-COCO**: 
  > "COCO." http://cocodataset.org/.

- **SQuAD**: 
  > "Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD)." https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/.

- **People’s Speech**: 
  > V. Janapa Reddi, P. Warden, and G. Diamos, “People’s Speech.” https://mlcommons.org/en/peoples-speech/.

- **1000 Words in 1000 Languages**: 
  > V. Janapa Reddi, P. Warden, and G. Diamos, “1000 Words in 1000 Languages.” https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C-6sq9o4Gz3E9WB9IfA94UICcwJC53Dqa9aQzPxVzJU/edit?usp=sharing.

- **Common Voice**: 
  > "Common Voice." https://voice.mozilla.org/en.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective references from the paper.
