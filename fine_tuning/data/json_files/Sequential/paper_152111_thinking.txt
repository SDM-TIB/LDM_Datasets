To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network Framework for Network Traffic Matrix Prediction" by Abdelhadi Azzouni and Guy Pujolle, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the validation of the proposed framework on real-world data from the GÉANT network, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors mention using real traffic data from the GÉANT backbone networks. Specifically, they state that they sampled 2004-time slot traffic matrix data from the GÉANT network at 15-minute intervals for several months. This indicates that the GÉANT traffic data is a key dataset used in their experiments.

I will also look for any specific details about the dataset, such as its structure or size. The authors mention that they consider a set of 309 traffic matrices measured between specific dates, which they transform into vectors for their analysis. This transformation indicates that the dataset is structured in a way that allows for time-series analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to the GÉANT dataset. The authors reference the GÉANT project in their paper, and I will ensure to include the citation for the GÉANT network data.

The citation for the GÉANT network is:
> GÉANT Project. *GÉANT: The pan-European research and education network*. Available at: https://www.geant.org/Projects/GEANT Project GN4.

Additionally, I will note that the authors also reference other works related to traffic prediction techniques, but the primary dataset they focus on is the GÉANT traffic data.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the GÉANT traffic data, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
