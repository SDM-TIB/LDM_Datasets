To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using LSTM recurrent neural networks for monitoring the LHC superconducting magnets" by Maciej Wielgosz et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of LSTM networks for modeling voltage time series from superconducting magnets, which suggests that there may be relevant datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology. In this section, they mention that data for training and testing was taken from the **CERN Logging Service (LS)** database. This indicates that the dataset is related to the voltage time series of the LHC superconducting magnets.

I will also look for any specific details about the datasets in the **results section**. The authors mention creating three different datasets: small, medium, and large, with sizes of 22 MB, 111 MB, and 5000 MB respectively. This provides concrete information about the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the **CERN Logging Service** and the **Quench Database** as sources of their data. However, these are not traditional datasets with formal citations but rather databases that contain the relevant data.

For the **CERN Logging Service**, I will note the following:
- **CERN Logging Service (LS)**: This is a global database that stores records of the magnets' activity, including voltage time series data. The authors reference it as a source of their data.

For the **Quench Database**, I will note:
- **Quench Database**: This database contains information about quench events in the superconducting magnets, which is crucial for their analysis.

Since these databases do not have formal citations like traditional datasets, I will summarize their relevance and provide the context in which they were used in the research.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that highlights the datasets and their sources, ensuring to include the context in which they were utilized in the research paper.
