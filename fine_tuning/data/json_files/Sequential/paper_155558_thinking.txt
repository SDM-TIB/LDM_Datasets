To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "The MuSe 2022 Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Challenge: Humor, Emotional Reactions, and Stress" by Lukas Christ et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that there are three datasets featured in the challenge: the Passau-SFCH dataset, the Hume-Reaction dataset, and the Ulm-TSST dataset. This gives me a clear starting point.

Next, I will delve into the **introduction** section, which provides context for the challenge and further details about the datasets. Here, I will look for specific descriptions of each dataset, including their contents and purposes.

Then, I will examine **section 2 (The Three Sub-Challenges)**, where the authors describe each dataset in detail. This section will provide comprehensive information about the datasets, including their characteristics, the number of subjects, and the types of data collected.

1. **Passau Spontaneous Football Coach Humor (Passau-SFCH) Dataset**: This dataset contains audio-visual recordings of German football coaches, labeled for the presence of humor. It features recordings from 10 Bundesliga coaches and includes approximately 18 hours of video.

2. **Hume-Reaction Dataset**: This dataset consists of over 70 hours of audio and video data from 2,222 subjects reacting to emotionally evocative stimuli. Each subject self-annotated their emotional reactions across seven classes.

3. **Ulm-Trier Social Stress Test (Ulm-TSST) Dataset**: This dataset includes recordings of individuals in a stress-inducing scenario, featuring audio-visual data and physiological signals. It is designed to assess emotional responses in stressful situations.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be referenced accurately in future work.

The citations I will extract are:

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference and use in future analyses or applications.
