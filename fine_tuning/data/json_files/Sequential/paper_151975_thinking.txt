To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ADVANCED LSTM: A STUDY ABOUT BETTER TIME DEPENDENCY MODELING IN EMOTION RECOGNITION" by Fei Tao and Gang Liu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the application of their proposed A-LSTM in emotion recognition but do not specify any datasets yet. I will continue to the **corpus description** section, which is likely to contain details about the datasets used.

In **section 3 (Corpus Description and Feature Extraction)**, the authors mention the **IEMOCAP corpus**. They describe it as having 5 sections and 10 actors, with a total of 10,039 utterances. This section provides a detailed description of the dataset, including the emotions represented and the audio features extracted.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the IEMOCAP corpus. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For **IEMOCAP corpus**:
  > C. Busso, M. Bulut, C.C. Lee, A. Kazemzadeh, E. Mower, S. Kim, J.N. Chang, S. Lee, and S.S. Narayanan. "IEMOCAP: Interactive emotional dyadic motion capture database." *Journal of Language Resources and Evaluation*, vol. 42, no. 4, pp. 335â€“359, December 2008.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will summarize the findings:

1. **IEMOCAP corpus**: A dataset used for emotion recognition, consisting of 10,039 utterances across various emotional categories, collected from 10 actors.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation is included for the IEMOCAP corpus.
