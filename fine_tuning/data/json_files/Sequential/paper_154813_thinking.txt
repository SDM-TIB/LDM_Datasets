To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Evaluation of Sequential Machine Learning for Network Intrusion Detection" by Shanchieh Jay Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their methodology on two well-known datasets for Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS): **CICIDS2017** and **CTU13**. This indicates that these datasets are central to the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets and Preprocessing)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they explicitly state that they are using:

1. **CICIDS2017**: This dataset contains synthetic benign traffic and various types of attacks, with specific time intervals for different attacks. The authors highlight its recentness and variety of attacks as reasons for its selection.

2. **CTU13**: This dataset consists of real network traffic data mixed with traffic generated by different botnet families. The authors mention that it is extensively used in literature and contains multiple malicious actions.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they applied their methodology to both datasets, reinforcing their significance in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CICIDS2017**, the citation is:
  > Iman Sharafaldin, Arash Habibi Lashkari, and Ali A Ghorbani. *Toward generating a new intrusion detection dataset and intrusion traffic characterization*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Information Systems Security and Privacy, pages 108–116, 2018.

- For **CTU13**, the citation is:
  > Sebastian Garcia, Martin Grill, Jan Stiborek, and Alejandro Zunino. *An empirical comparison of botnet detection methods*. In Computers & Security, volume 45, pages 100–123, 2014.

With these citations, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for future reference. This structured approach ensures that I capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
