To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SC-FEGAN: Face Editing Generative Adversarial Network with Userâ€™s Sketch and Color" by Youngjoo Jo and Jongyoul Park, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the system, but I need to look for specific datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Approach)**, particularly **subsection 3.1 (Training Data)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training their model. Here, they mention using the **CelebA-HQ dataset** for training and testing their network. They specify that they randomly selected 29,000 images for training and 1,000 images for testing, resizing them to 512x512 pixels.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **CelebA-HQ dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> T. Karras, T. Aila, S. Laine, and J. Lehtinen. *Progressive growing of gans for improved quality, stability, and variation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.10196, 2017.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. In this case, the authors refer to the **GFC (Global Face Completion)** method for generating masks and color domains, but they do not specify a separate dataset for GFC. Instead, they describe it as a method used in conjunction with the CelebA-HQ dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **CelebA-HQ dataset**. 

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring they are clearly documented and ready for any further processing or review.
