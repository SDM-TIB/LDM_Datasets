To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differentiable Divergences Between Time Series" by Mathieu Blondel, Arthur Mensch, and Jean-Philippe Vert, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract highlights that the authors demonstrate significant accuracy improvements on **84 time series classification datasets**, which indicates that there are multiple datasets involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors refer to the **UCR time series classification archive** as the source of the datasets used for their experiments. This is a crucial piece of information that I need to document.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they used a subset containing **84 datasets** from the UCR archive, which encompasses a variety of fields such as astronomy, geology, and medical imaging. They also note that these datasets include class information and are split into train and test sets.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the UCR time series classification archive. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For the UCR time series classification archive:
  > Yanping Chen, Eamonn Keogh, Bing Hu, Nurjahan Begum, Anthony Bagnall, Abdullah Mueen, and Gustavo Batista. *The UCR Time Series Classification Archive*, July 2015. www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data/.

Since the paper does not list individual datasets with separate citations, I will note that the datasets are part of the UCR archive, which is a well-known resource in the field.

Finally, I will summarize the findings:
1. **UCR Time Series Classification Archive**: Contains 84 datasets used for experiments, covering various fields and including class information.

I will ensure that this information is clearly documented and ready for any further processing or review.
