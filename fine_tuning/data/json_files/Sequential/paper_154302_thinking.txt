To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Sequential Learning for Cervical Spine Fracture Detection on Computed Tomography Imaging" by Hojjat Salehinejad et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used an annotated dataset of **3,666 CT scans** (729 positive and 2,937 negative cases) for training and validation. This is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3.1 (Data)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They mention that the dataset consists of **3,666 cervical spine CT scans**, which includes **1,174,335 images** in total, with **20,392 fracture positive images** and **1,153,943 fracture negative images**. The dataset is pixel-level annotated by three expert radiologists, which adds credibility to its quality.

The authors also mention that they are in the process of releasing this dataset to the research community, which suggests that it may be publicly available in the future.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is created by the authors themselves and is not published in a separate paper, it may not have a formal citation. Instead, I will note that the dataset is described in the paper itself.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:
- **Cervical Spine CT Dataset**: Contains 3,666 CT scans with annotations for fractures, including both positive and negative cases.

Since the dataset does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is referenced in the paper and provide the citation for the paper itself:

Salehinejad, H., Ho, E., Lin, H.-M., Crivellaro, P., Samorodova, O., Tafur Arciniegas, M., Merali, Z., Suthiphosuwan, S., Bharatha, A., Yeom, K., Mamdani, M., Wilson, J., & Colak, E. (2023). Deep Sequential Learning for Cervical Spine Fracture Detection on Computed Tomography Imaging. *[Journal Name]*, *[Volume]*, *[Pages]*. 

Now, I will compile the dataset entry and the citation into a structured format for further processing.
