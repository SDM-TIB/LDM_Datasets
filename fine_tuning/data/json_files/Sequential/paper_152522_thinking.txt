To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Semi-Supervised Learning for Deep Semantic Role Labeling" by Sanket Vaibhav Mehta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a semi-supervised method for semantic role labeling (SRL) and mentions performance on the CoNLL-2012 English section, which suggests that this dataset is relevant.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. In **Section 3.1**, they explicitly state that they evaluate their model's performance on the **CoNLL-2012 dataset**, which contains gold predicates and parse information. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including the number of sentences in the training, development, and test splits.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CoNLL-2012 dataset. The authors reference the original work that introduced this dataset, which is essential for proper citation.

The citation for the CoNLL-2012 dataset is:
> Sameer Pradhan, Alessandro Moschitti, Nianwen Xue, Hwee Tou Ng, Anders Björkelund, Olga Uryupina, Yuchen Zhang, and Zhi Zhong. *Towards robust linguistic analysis using ontonotes*. In Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning, pages 143–152, 2013.

Now, I will summarize the findings:

1. **CoNLL-2012 Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed semi-supervised learning method for semantic role labeling. It contains gold predicates and parse information for each sentence, with a standard train/development/test split of 278K/38.3K/25.6K sentences.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the CoNLL-2012 dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution in any subsequent use of this information.
