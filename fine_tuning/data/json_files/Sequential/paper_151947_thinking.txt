To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Customized Nonlinear Bandits for Online Response Selection in Neural Conversation Models" by Bing Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experimental results are based on the **Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the study. The introduction further discusses the context of conversational agents and the importance of datasets in training these models.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** or **Experiments** section, which is likely to provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this paper, the **Experiments** section explicitly states that the authors used the **Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus (UDC)** for their evaluation. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its purpose and characteristics.

The paper describes the **Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus** as a multi-turn dialog corpus constructed from Ubuntu chat logs, specifically for technical support related to Ubuntu problems. It mentions that the dataset contains dialog context-response pairs, which is essential for understanding its application in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Lowe, R.; Pow, N.; Serban, I.; and Pineau, J. (2015). *The ubuntu dialogue corpus: A large dataset for research in unstructured multi-turn dialogue systems*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.08909.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entry for the **Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus**, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and completeness.
