To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Architecture Search for Joint Optimization of Predictive Power and Biological Knowledge" by Zijun Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "simulated data" and "real data of functional genomics," which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsection titled "Simulated data" and "ENCODE eCLIP multitask protein binding prediction." In the "Simulated data" subsection, the authors describe the generation of simulated genomic sequence data, specifically mentioning:

1. **Simulated DNA sequences**: A dataset of 10,000 positive DNA sequences with a single DNA binding event based on the transcription factor MYC, and a corresponding negative set of 10,000 sequences without any binding events.

2. **Multitask simulation dataset**: This dataset includes three transcription factors (CTCF, IRF, MYC) and is used for evaluating the performance of the BioNAS framework.

In the "ENCODE eCLIP multitask protein binding prediction" subsection, the authors refer to the use of publicly available **ENCODE eCLIP data**, which consists of RNA sequences and their corresponding protein binding sites. They mention that they compiled training labels and genomic sequences from this dataset, totaling 538,955 sequences for training and 59,883 for validation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **simulated genomic sequences**, the authors reference a genomic sequences simulator:
   > Kundaje Lab. *simDNA: Simulated datasets of DNA*. Available at: https://github.com/kundajelab/simdna, 2019.

2. For the **ENCODE eCLIP data**, the citation is:
   > Eric L. Van Nostrand, Gabriel A. Pratt, Alexander A. Shishkin, et al. *Robust transcriptome-wide discovery of RNA-binding protein binding sites with enhanced CLIP (eCLIP)*. Nature Methods, 13(6):508â€“514, March 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation for proper attribution. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
