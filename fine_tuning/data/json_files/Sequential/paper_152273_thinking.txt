To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning with a Combinatorial Action Space for Predicting Popular Reddit Threads" by Ji He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a benchmark task for reinforcement learning using Reddit data, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets or data sources.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss using Reddit for popularity prediction and tracking, which suggests that the data comes from Reddit discussions. I will note any specific subreddit names or details about the data collection process.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. They mention that their data consists of five subreddits: **askscience, askmen, todayilearned, worldnews, and nfl**. Each subreddit has a different number of posts and comments, which is crucial information for describing the datasets.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets. However, since the data is sourced from Reddit, it may not have a formal citation like traditional datasets. Instead, I will note that the data is publicly available from Reddit and provide the URLs for accessing the subreddits.

Hereâ€™s the summary of the datasets I will extract:

1. **askscience subreddit**: Contains 0.94k posts and 0.32M comments.
2. **askmen subreddit**: Contains 4.45k posts and 1.06M comments.
3. **todayilearned subreddit**: Contains 9.44k posts and 5.11M comments.
4. **worldnews subreddit**: Contains 9.88k posts and 5.99M comments.
5. **nfl subreddit**: Contains 11.73k posts and 6.12M comments.

For each subreddit, I will note that the data is sourced from Reddit and provide the URL for the subreddit as the citation.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, including the subreddit name, number of posts, number of comments, and the citation as the URL of the subreddit.

After completing this process, I will ensure that the dataset entries are ready for review or further processing.
