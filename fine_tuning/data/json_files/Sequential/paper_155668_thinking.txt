To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep CLSTM for Predictive Beamforming in Integrated Sensing and Communication-enabled Vehicular Networks" by Chang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in previous work.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the methodology or results sections. In this paper, the authors describe their approach and may reference specific datasets used for training or testing their model.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets in the sections I have read. However, they refer to the use of historical channel state information (CSI) and vehicle mobility models, which may imply the use of synthetic datasets or simulations rather than publicly available datasets.

Since there are no specific datasets mentioned, I will check the **References section** for any cited works that may include datasets. If the authors have referenced other papers that describe datasets, I will extract those citations.

If I find any relevant datasets, I will ensure to note their full citations. For example, if they reference a dataset from a previous study, I will include that citation in my final output.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including any relevant citations, into a structured format for easy reference. If no datasets are found, I will note that as well.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections for dataset mentions.
2. Look for a dedicated datasets section or references to datasets in the methodology.
3. Check the References section for any cited works that may include datasets.
4. Compile the findings, including full citations for any identified datasets.
