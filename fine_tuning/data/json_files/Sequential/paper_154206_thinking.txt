To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Autoencoders for Unsupervised Text Style Transfer" by Yufang Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors validate their method on "two widely-used public datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically section 4.1.1) where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Yelp Restaurant Review Sentiment Transfer Dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment transfer tasks. The authors specify that it contains reviews labeled as positive or negative based on ratings.

2. **Yahoo QA Topic Transfer Dataset**: This dataset is used for topic transfer tasks, specifically focusing on two topics: "Entertainment & Music" and "Politics & Government."

In the same section, the authors provide statistics about the datasets, including the number of sentences and vocabulary sizes, which helps in understanding the datasets' scale.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets directly, but it references previous works that used these datasets. Therefore, I will look for the original papers or sources that introduced these datasets:

- For the **Yelp dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shen, T., Lei, T., Barzilay, R., & Jaakkola, T. (2017). Style transfer from non-parallel text by cross-alignment. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (pp. 6830-6841).

- For the **Yahoo QA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nogueira dos Santos, C., Melnyk, I., & Padhi, I. (2018). Fighting offensive language on social media with unsupervised text style transfer. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers) (pp. 189-194).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately captured for future reference.
