To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-supervised estimation of event temporal length for cell event detection" by Ha Tran Hong Phan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a video of densely packed stem cell PCM images, which suggests that this is a dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **Introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges of cell event detection and the need for annotated training datasets, but I need to find explicit dataset names.

In the **Methods section**, particularly under the **Dataset** subsection, the authors provide details about the dataset used. They mention that they used a video of 210 frames of densely packed stem cell PCM images, specifically capturing bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). This is a clear identification of the dataset used for their experiments.

I will also check the **Experiments section** to confirm that this dataset was indeed utilized for training and testing their models. The authors describe how they trained their models on the first 110 frames of the video and tested on the last 100 frames, which further validates the dataset's role in their research.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors reference a previous work by Huh et al. (2011) that used the same video dataset. I will locate the full citation for this reference in the **References section**.

The citation for the dataset is:
> S. Huh, D. F. Ker, H. Su, and T. Kanade. "Detection of mitosis within a stem cell population of high cell confluence in phase-contrast microscopy images," in Proc. CVPR, 2011, pp. 1033-1040.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the steps I took were:
1. Read through the abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections to identify datasets.
2. Confirm the dataset's details in the methods section.
3. Validate its use in the experiments section.
4. Retrieve the full citation from the references.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
