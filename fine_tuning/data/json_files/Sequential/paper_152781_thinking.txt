To extract datasets from the research paper titled "High-performance stock index trading: making effective use of a deep long short-term memory network" by Chariton Chalvatzis and Dimitrios Hristu-Varsakelis, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their model on major U.S. stock indices, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), NASDAQ, and Russell 2000 indices, which are likely the datasets used for their experiments.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in the parts discussing the model training and evaluation, I will look for explicit details about the datasets. The authors mention that they tested their approach on the S&P 500, DJIA, NASDAQ, and Russell 2000 over the period from October 2010 to May 2018. This confirms that these indices are indeed the datasets utilized in their research.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets. However, since these indices are well-known financial benchmarks, they may not have specific citations like other datasets might. Instead, I will note that they are commonly used datasets in financial research.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **S&P 500 Index**: A stock market index that measures the stock performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. The dataset spans from October 2010 to May 2018.

2. **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)**: A stock market index that indicates the value of 30 significant publicly traded companies in the U.S. The dataset also covers the same period from October 2010 to May 2018.

3. **NASDAQ Index**: A stock market index that includes over 3,000 stocks listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. This dataset is used for the same time frame as the others.

4. **Russell 2000 Index**: A stock market index that measures the performance of the 2,000 smallest stocks in the Russell 3000 Index. This dataset is similarly from October 2010 to May 2018.

Since these indices are widely recognized, I will note that they do not have specific citations but are standard datasets in financial analysis.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
