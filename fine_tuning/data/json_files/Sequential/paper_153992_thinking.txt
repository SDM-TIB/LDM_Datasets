To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluation Of Hidden Markov Models Using Deep CNN Features In Isolated Sign Recognition" by Anil Osman Tur and Hacer Yalim Keles, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and it may mention the dataset used for isolated sign recognition. The introduction typically elaborates on the problem and may reference specific datasets that are relevant to the research.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors discuss the challenges of isolated sign recognition and may refer to datasets that have been used in previous studies or their own work.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly **section 3.1 (Dataset and Preprocessing)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention the **Montalbano dataset**, which contains 20 different Italian gestures performed by 27 different signers. The dataset includes various modalities such as RGB, Depth, User Mask, and Skeletal data. This section will provide specific details about the dataset, including the number of samples and the modalities used.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Montalbano dataset. The authors may cite the original source of the dataset or any relevant papers that describe it.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that I accurately represent the information as it appears in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its citation for future reference.
