To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mathematical Models and Reinforcement Learning based Evolutionary Algorithm Framework for Satellite Scheduling Problem" by Yanjie Song, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that describe the models and experiments** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the **introduction** and **model descriptions** for any indications of datasets used in the experiments or simulations.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the complexity of satellite scheduling problems and mentions the use of models and algorithms. However, there are no specific datasets mentioned here. I will then move on to the **sections detailing the models** (EDDSP and MSJOPP) to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of these models.

While reviewing the **mathematical models**, I will look for any references to empirical data or datasets that might have been used to validate the models. The paper cites other works, which may indicate the use of datasets from those studies. For example, in the **references**, I will check if any of the cited papers are known datasets or if they provide datasets that the author might have utilized.

Next, I will examine the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The references include:

1. **Reference [1]**: Y. Song et al., "RL-GA: A reinforcement learning-based genetic algorithm for electromagnetic detection satellite scheduling problem," Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 2023. This reference may contain datasets related to the electromagnetic detection satellite scheduling problem.

2. **Reference [2]**: Y. Song et al., "Two-stage hybrid planning method for multi-satellite joint observation planning problem considering task splitting," Computers & Industrial Engineering, 2022. This may also reference datasets relevant to the multi-satellite joint observation planning problem.

3. **Reference [3]**: J. Berger et al., "A graph-based genetic algorithm to solve the virtual constellation multi-satellite collection scheduling problem," in 2018 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC), IEEE, 2018. This could provide datasets related to multi-satellite scheduling.

4. **Reference [4]**: X. Chen et al., "A mixed integer linear programming model for multi-satellite scheduling," European Journal of Operational Research, 2019. This reference may also include datasets used for scheduling problems.

After identifying these references, I will compile the full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper or those that are implied through the references. If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will note that the datasets may be derived from the referenced works.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset, even if they are indirectly referenced through the cited literature. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets associated with the research paper.
