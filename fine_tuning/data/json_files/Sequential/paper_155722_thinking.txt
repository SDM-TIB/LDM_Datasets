To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AI-based Arabic Language and Speech Tutor" by Sicong Shao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the AI-ALST system and its evaluation, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section III (The Course: Moroccan Arabic Dialect)**, where the authors describe the materials used for their experiments. They mention using materials from two Moroccan Arabic multimedia eTextbooks, which suggests that these eTextbooks may serve as datasets for their study.

In **section V (Experiments and Results)**, the authors detail their experimental settings and mention a specific dataset used for evaluating the AI-ALST system. They describe a corpus of 17 common words from a Moroccan Arabic Darija class, pronounced by 12 participants, totaling 3,851 audio recordings. This section is crucial as it provides specific details about the dataset, including the number of audios and their classification into correct and mispronounced categories.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the Arabic Learner Corpus (ALC) and other Arabic corpora developed by organizations like the European Language Resources Association (ELRA) and the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC). I will ensure to extract the full citations for these resources.

For the **Arabic Learner Corpus (ALC)**, the citation is:
> Zaki, M. (2017). *Corpus based teaching in the Arabic classroom: Theoretical and practical perspectives*. International Journal of Applied Linguistics, 27(2), 514-541.

For the **Arabic Gigaword**, the citation is:
> LDC. (2005). *Arabic Gigaword, 2nd Edition*. Linguistic Data Consortium.

For the **Al-Hayat Arabic Corpus**, the citation is:
> ELRA. (2005). *Al-Hayat Arabic Corpus*. European Language Resources Association.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
