To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DartsReNet: Exploring new RNN cells in ReNet architectures" by Brian B. Moser et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the authors compare their results with standard RNN cells on **CIFAR-10** and **SVHN**, indicating that these datasets are used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 3.3 (Training)**, where the authors describe their methodology. They explicitly mention that they used **CIFAR-10** and **SVHN** datasets for their experiments. This confirms that these are the datasets utilized in their research.

Now, I will gather detailed information about each dataset from the paper. The authors provide some context about the datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of images of size 32x32x3 and contains ten classes. It is a well-known dataset in the field of image classification.

2. **SVHN (Street View House Numbers)**: Similar to CIFAR-10, SVHN also contains images of size 32x32x3 and is used for digit recognition tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Nair, V., Hinton, G. (2009). *Cifar-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*. Retrieved from http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Netzer, Y., Wang, T., Coates, A., Bissacco, A., Wu, B., Ng, A.Y. (2011). *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. 

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
