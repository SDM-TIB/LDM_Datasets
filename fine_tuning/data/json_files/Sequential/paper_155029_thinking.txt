To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep-Learning Based Optimization Approach to Address Stop-Skipping Strategy in Urban Rail Transit Lines" by Mohammadjavad Javadinasr et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of **time-series smart card data for an entire month**, indicating that this dataset is crucial for the study.

Next, I will focus on the **data section**, which provides detailed information about the dataset used. The authors specify that they utilized **hourly trip rates between stations of line 1**, extracted from the automated fare collection system. This dataset includes **8,272,317 trips** recorded from **April 21, 2018, to May 21, 2018**, and contains unique identifiers for each passenger, transaction times, and transaction types (entry or exit).

I will also check the **methodology section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors refer to any other data sources. However, the primary dataset appears to be the smart card data used for training the LSTM model.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. In this case, the smart card data is not attributed to a specific publication but is described as being collected from the automated fare collection system of the Tehran urban rail network.

Since there are no formal citations for the dataset in the references, I will note that the dataset is derived from the Tehran urban rail network's automated fare collection system, which is a common source for transit data.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Tehran Urban Rail Smart Card Data
   - **Description**: This dataset includes hourly trip rates between stations of line 1, comprising 8,272,317 trips recorded from April 21, 2018, to May 21, 2018. It contains unique identifiers for each passenger, transaction times, and transaction types (entry or exit).
   - **Citation**: Data collected from the automated fare collection system of the Tehran urban rail network.

With this information compiled, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
