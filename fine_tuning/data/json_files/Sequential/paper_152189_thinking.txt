To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Speech Recognition Engine with Sparse LSTM on FPGA" by Song Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets along with their full citations.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of LSTM for speech recognition and references the evaluation on specific datasets. This indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experimental results** sections. In this paper, the authors mention using the **TIMIT dataset** for their experiments. The TIMIT dataset is a well-known corpus for speech recognition tasks, which is a strong indication that it is a primary dataset used in their evaluations.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used, specifically stating that they evaluated their model on the TIMIT dataset and a proprietary dataset with 1000 hours of training data, 100 hours of validation data, and 10 hours of test data. This confirms the datasets utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citation for the TIMIT dataset is as follows:
- **TIMIT Dataset**: 
  > J. S. Garofolo, L. F. Lamel, W. M. Fisher, J. G. Fiscus, and D. S. Pallett. *DARPA TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus CD-ROM*. NIST Speech Disc 1-1.1. NASA STI/Recon Technical Report N, 93, 1993.

For the proprietary dataset, since it is not a publicly available dataset, it may not have a formal citation. However, I will note its description as provided in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the TIMIT dataset and a description for the proprietary dataset, ready for structured output.
