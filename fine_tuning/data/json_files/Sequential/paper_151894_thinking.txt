To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identifying Clickbait: A Multi-Strategy Approach Using Neural Networks" by Vaibhav Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often contextualizes the problem and may reference datasets used in prior work.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of clickbait detection and mention that their model is evaluated on a test corpus of **19,538 social media posts**. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more details about it.

Next, I will look into the **evaluation results section** where the authors mention that they performed experiments over a collection of **19,538 social media posts**. They also reference a crowdsourced dataset of clickbait on Twitter, which is likely the dataset they used for their experiments.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors cite a paper that discusses the crowdsourced dataset:

- For the dataset of social media posts, the citation is:
  > M. Potthast, T. Gollub, K. Komlossy, S. Schuster, M. Wiegmann, E. Garces, M. Hagen, and B. Stein. *Crowdsourcing a Large Corpus of Clickbait on Twitter*. In (to appear), 2017.

This citation provides the necessary details about the dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Dataset Name**: Social Media Posts Dataset
   - **Description**: A collection of 19,538 social media posts used for evaluating clickbait detection models.
   - **Full Citation**: M. Potthast, T. Gollub, K. Komlossy, S. Schuster, M. Wiegmann, E. Garces, M. Hagen, and B. Stein. *Crowdsourcing a Large Corpus of Clickbait on Twitter*. In (to appear), 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
