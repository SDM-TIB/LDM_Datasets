To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "MASON-NLP at eRisk 2023: Deep Learning-Based Detection of Depression Symptoms from Social Media Texts" by Fardin Ahsan Sakib et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, dataset, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on detecting depression symptoms from social media texts, which suggests that datasets related to social media might be involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for their study:

1. **Official Dataset for eRisk 2023 Task 1**: This dataset is derived from previous eRisk data and is formatted according to TREC guidelines. It consists of contributions from 3,107 unique users, totaling 3,807,115 sentences. Each user has an average of 1,225 sentences associated with their profile.

2. **Depression: Reddit Dataset**: Sourced from Kaggle, this dataset contains raw data scraped from various mental health-related subreddits. After processing, it includes 7,731 sentences, each labeled as either related to depression ('1') or not ('0'). The dataset is fairly balanced with 3,831 positive examples and 3,900 negative examples.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the eRisk 2023 Task 1 dataset but does not provide a specific citation for it, as it is derived from previous eRisk data. However, I will note that it is associated with the eRisk conference.

For the **Depression: Reddit Dataset**, the citation is:
> Kaggle. *Kaggle: Your Machine Learning and Data Science Community*. https://www.kaggle.com, accessed 2023.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.
