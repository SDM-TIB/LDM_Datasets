To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Energy and Resource Efficiency by User Traffic Prediction and Classification in Cellular Networks" by Amin Azari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a "real network traffic dataset" for empirical evaluation, which indicates that a dataset is indeed involved. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed information about the datasets used. In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the generation of their own dataset for traffic prediction and classification. They mention two types of data: labeled and unlabeled data, generated using a packet capture tool called "NetGuard." 

I will note the details of the dataset generation process, including the features captured, such as packet arrival times, packet lengths, and communication protocols. The authors also state that they have made part of this dataset available online, which is crucial for citation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper mentions that the dataset can be accessed via a GitHub repository. I will document this as the citation for the dataset.

The relevant datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **User Traffic Dataset**: This dataset was generated using the NetGuard application, capturing cellular traffic at the IP level. It includes labeled and unlabeled data, focusing on various applications like surfing and video calling.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Azari, A., Salehi, F., Papapetrou, P., & Cavdar, C. (2021). *Cellular traffic analysis*. GitHub repository. Available at: https://github.com/AminAzari/cellular-trafÔ¨Åc-analysis

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
