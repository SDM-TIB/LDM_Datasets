To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretability for Multimodal Emotion Recognition using Concept Activation Vectors" by Ashish Ramayee Asokan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of the **IEMOCAP multimodal database**, which suggests that this is a key dataset for the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about the datasets. The authors discuss the importance of emotion recognition and mention the IEMOCAP database again, indicating its relevance to their work.

In the **experiments section**, specifically section IV.B, the authors provide a detailed description of the **IEMOCAP database**. They explain that it consists of scripted acts and improvisations involving 10 speakers, with each video associated with one of six emotion labels. This section confirms that the IEMOCAP database is the primary dataset used for training their model.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the IEMOCAP dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> C. Busso, M. Bulut, C.-C. Lee, A. Kazemzadeh, E. Mower, S. Kim, J. N. Chang, S. Lee, and S. S. Narayanan. *IEMOCAP: Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture Database*. Language Resources and Evaluation, vol. 42, no. 4, pp. 335â€“359, 2008.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the IEMOCAP dataset, I will document this dataset as the main dataset used in their research.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset, including its description and citation, ensuring that the citation is complete and accurate for future reference.
