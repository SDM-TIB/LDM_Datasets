To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EmotionX-DLC: Self-Attentive BiLSTM for Detecting Sequential Emotions in Dialogues" by Linkai Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved accuracy scores on the **Friends** and **EmotionPush** test sets, suggesting these may be the datasets used.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (specifically section 3) to gather more details about the datasets. In section 3.1, the authors describe the **EmotionX dataset**, which consists of dialogues from the **Friends TV scripts** and **EmotionPush chat logs**. They provide specific statistics about the dataset, including the number of dialogues, sentences, and unique words.

I will note the following details about the datasets:

1. **Friends Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the TV show "Friends" and contains dialogues used for emotion classification. The authors mention that there are 720 dialogues in this dataset.

2. **EmotionPush Dataset**: This dataset consists of chat logs from Facebook Messenger, also containing 720 dialogues. Together with the Friends dataset, they yield a total of 1,440 dialogues.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets directly, but I can infer the following based on common knowledge:

- For the **Friends Dataset**, a common citation is:
  > The Friends TV Show. *Friends*. NBC, 1994-2004.

- For the **EmotionPush Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chen, S., Hsu, C., Kuo, T., Huang, T., & Ku, L. (2018). Emotionlines: An emotion corpus of multi-party conversations. CoRR, abs/1802.08379.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring they are structured and ready for any further processing or review.
