To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Logographic Subword Model for Neural Machine Translation" by Yihao Fang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any references to datasets. Here, the authors discuss the challenges of sequence-to-sequence models in machine translation but do not specify any datasets.

Moving on to the **evaluation section (Section 6)**, I will look for details about the datasets used for training and testing the models. In this section, the authors mention using the **United Nations Parallel Corpus** for model training and testing, specifically noting that they used the first 500,000 pair-wise aligned sentences from this corpus.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the United Nations Parallel Corpus. The citation is as follows:
> Michal Ziemski, Marcin Junczys-Dowmunt, and Bruno Pouliquen. *The United Nations Parallel Corpus v1.0*. In LREC, 2016.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will summarize the findings:

1. **United Nations Parallel Corpus**: This dataset consists of aligned sentences in English and Chinese, used for training and testing the proposed logographic subword model.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This ensures that all relevant information is captured accurately and can be easily accessed later.
