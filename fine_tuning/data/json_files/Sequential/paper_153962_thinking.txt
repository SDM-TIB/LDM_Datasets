To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hypernetwork-Based Augmentation" by Chih-Yang Chen and Che-Han Chang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that experiments were conducted on **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet**, which indicates that these datasets are likely to be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention the datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 natural images in 10 classes, with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The authors mention that they applied their augmentation policy to this dataset.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 60,000 images but is divided into 100 classes. It also has 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

3. **SVHN (Street View House Numbers)**: This dataset consists of 73,257 training images and 26,032 test images, primarily used for digit recognition.

4. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with approximately 1.2 million training images and 50,000 validation images, used for image classification tasks.

In the **implementation details** section, the authors provide additional context about how these datasets were used in their experiments, confirming their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. In NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning, 2011.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In CVPR, 2009.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further analysis or processing of the datasets mentioned in the paper.
