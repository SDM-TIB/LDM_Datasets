To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Investigating Label Bias in Beam Search for Open-ended Text Generation" by Liang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **large-scale response generation datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they refer to two datasets:

1. **Reddit Dataset**: This dataset is described as consisting of more than 10 million dialogue turns and is noted for being noisy and containing some offensive language.

2. **ConvAI2 Dataset**: This dataset is characterized as high quality, used for model fine-tuning, and consists of 123k dialogue turns in the training set and nearly 15k turns in the validation set. The authors mention that they discard persona information to make the task more open-ended.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of these datasets:

- For the **Reddit Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nouha Dziri, Ehsan Kamalloo, Kory Wallace Mathewson, and Osmar R Zaiane. *Augmenting neural response generation with context-aware topical attention*. ArXiv, abs/1811.01063, 2018.

- For the **ConvAI2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Emily Dinan, Varvara Logacheva, Valentin Malykh, Alexander H. Miller, Kurt Shuster, Jack Urbanek, Douwe Kiela, Arthur Szlam, Iulian Serban, Ryan Lowe, Shrimai Prabhumoye, Alan W. Black, Alexander I. Rudnicky, Jason Williams, Joelle Pineau, Mikhail Burtsev, and Jason Weston. *The second conversational intelligence challenge (convai2)*. ArXiv, abs/1902.00098, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
