To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differential Evolution Algorithm based Hyper-Parameters Selection of Transformer Neural Network Model for Load Forecasting" by Anuvab Sen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental details sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the **experimental details section** is likely to contain specific information about the datasets used.

In the **experimental details section**, I will focus on the **Dataset Description** subsection. Here, the authors mention a dataset called **Load Dataset1**, which is curated using meteorological data from the Government of Canada. This dataset is described in detail, including the time period it covers (from January 1, 2017, to July 4, 2023), the number of variables (19), and the total number of rows (96,432). This is a clear indication that I have found a dataset relevant to their research.

Next, I will look for the **full citation** for this dataset. The authors reference the dataset with a link, which is crucial for providing a complete citation. The citation is as follows:
> Government of Canada. Climate. (2023, May). Retrieved from https://climate.Load.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html

Since this dataset is the only one explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format.

Now, I will summarize the findings:
1. **Load Dataset1**: A dataset curated from meteorological data from the Government of Canada, covering various variables related to load forecasting.

Finally, I will ensure that I have all the necessary details to present the dataset in a clear and concise manner, ready for any further processing or review.
