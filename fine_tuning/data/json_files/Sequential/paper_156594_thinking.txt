To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GCN-DevLSTM: Path Development for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition" by Lei Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted empirical studies on **NTU60, NTU120, and Chalearn2013 datasets**, indicating that these are the datasets used for their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors provide a brief description of each dataset:

1. **Chalearn2013 Dataset**: This dataset is used for gesture recognition and consists of 11,116 skeleton examples across 20 gesture categories, filmed by 27 people. Each frame contains 20 joints.

2. **NTU RGB+D 60 (NTU-60)**: This dataset includes 56,880 action samples and 60 action classes, filmed by 40 people using three Kinect cameras. The dataset features 25 joints with varying sequence lengths.

3. **NTU RGB+D 120 (NTU-120)**: An extension of NTU-60, this dataset contains 114,480 samples and 120 action classes, filmed by 106 people in three camera views.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Chalearn2013 Dataset**:

In 15th ACM on International conference on multimodal interaction, pages 365–368, 2013.

- For **NTU RGB+D 120 Dataset**:

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details for future reference or processing.
