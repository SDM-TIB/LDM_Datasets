To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Shortcut Sequence Tagging" by Huijia Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors achieved a 6% improvement on the **CCGbank supertagging dataset**, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will examine **section 5.1.1 (Dataset and Pre-processing)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. They mention using the **CCGbank** dataset, which is a translation from the Penn Treebank, and they specify the sections used for training, development, and testing.

In addition, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper, particularly in the context of the **Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging** task discussed in section 5.2. Here, the authors refer to the **Wall Street Journal of the Penn Treebank dataset** for their POS tagging experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. For the **CCGbank dataset**, the citation is:
   > Julia Hockenmaier and Mark Steedman. *CCGbank: A corpus of CCG derivations and dependency structures extracted from the Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 33(3):355–396, 2007.

2. For the **Penn Treebank dataset**, the citation is:
   > Mitchell P Marcus, Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz, and Beatrice Santorini. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2):313–330, 1993.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **CCGbank**: Used for CCG supertagging, with specific sections designated for training, development, and testing.
- **Penn Treebank**: Used for POS tagging, with standard splits for training, validation, and testing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately represented for further processing or review.
