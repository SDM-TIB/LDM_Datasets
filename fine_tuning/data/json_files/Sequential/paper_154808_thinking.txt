To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An optimized Capsule-LSTM model for facial expression recognition with video sequences" by Siwei Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the experimental results are derived from the **MMI dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Data set and data processing)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used. Here, they describe the **MMI facial expression database**, which contains over 2900 expression videos from more than 75 subjects. The authors specify that they selected 208 video sequences marked with six basic expression labels for their experiments.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper, but it appears that the MMI dataset is the primary focus for their experiments. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MMI dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For the **MMI facial expression database**, the citation is:
  > Valstar M., Pantic M. Induced disgust, happiness and surprise: an addition to the MMI facial expression database. In Proceedings of the 3rd Intern. Workshop on EMOTION (satellite of LREC): Corpora for Research on Emotion and Affect. Rosten: Internet Society, 2010: 65-65.

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the dataset details and prepare to format them according to the required structure.

In conclusion, the only dataset extracted from this paper is the MMI dataset, and I will ensure to include its full citation in the final output.
