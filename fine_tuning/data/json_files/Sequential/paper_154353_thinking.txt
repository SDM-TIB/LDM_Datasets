To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Two-Phase Approach for Abstractive Podcast Summarization" by Chujie Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, while the introduction may highlight the significance of the datasets used.

In **section 2 (Dataset)**, the authors explicitly mention the **TREC Spotify podcast dataset**. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of podcast episodes, the criteria for filtering, and the preprocessing steps taken. This section is crucial as it contains the primary dataset used in their research.

The authors describe the dataset as follows:
- **TREC Spotify Podcast Dataset**: Initially contains 105,360 podcast episodes from 18,376 shows, filtered down to 52,140 episodes after applying various criteria.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the TREC Spotify podcast dataset. The relevant citation is:
- For the **TREC Spotify Podcast Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ann Clifton, Aasish Pappu, Sravana Reddy, Yongze Yu, Jussi Karlgren, Ben Carterette, and Rosie Jones. *The Spotify Podcasts Dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.04270, 2020.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and completeness.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is ready for review or further processing, maintaining the importance of including the full citation for proper attribution.
