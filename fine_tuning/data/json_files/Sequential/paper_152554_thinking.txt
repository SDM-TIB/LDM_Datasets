To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Retrieval-Enhanced Adversarial Training for Neural Response Generation" by Qingfu Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions an empirical study on a "large scale public available benchmark dataset," which indicates that a dataset is used, but does not specify its name. I will need to look further into the paper to find the exact dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), particularly **section 4.1 (Data)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention using the **NTCIR corpus** for their experiments, which is a significant dataset in the context of their research.

In section 4.1, the authors provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of messages and responses, which confirms its relevance and scale. They also mention that the data is collected from a Chinese microblogging service, Sina Weibo, which adds context to the dataset's origin.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the NTCIR corpus. The citation for the NTCIR corpus is as follows:
> NTCIR. *NTCIR-13: Evaluation of Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing*. Available at: http://research.nii.ac.jp/ntcir/data/data-en.html.

This citation provides the necessary details about the dataset, including its title and where it can be accessed.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the findings for the dataset in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

In conclusion, I have identified the **NTCIR corpus** as the primary dataset used in the research, and I have retrieved its full citation. This process ensures that I have accurately extracted the necessary dataset information from the paper.
