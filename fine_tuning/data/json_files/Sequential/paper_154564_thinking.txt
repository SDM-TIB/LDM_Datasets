To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LVCNET: EFFICIENT CONDITION-DEPENDENT MODELING NETWORK FOR WAVEFORM GENERATION" by Zhen Zeng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on the **LJSpeech dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely important for the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any additional context or details about the datasets used. The introduction discusses the advancements in waveform generation and mentions various models but does not introduce new datasets.

In the **experiments section**, specifically **section 3.1.1 (Database)**, the authors provide detailed information about the **LJSpeech dataset**. They describe how the dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets, which confirms its significance in their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the LJSpeech dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Keith Ito, “The LJSpeech Dataset,” https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/, 2017.

This citation is crucial as it provides the necessary details for anyone looking to reference the dataset.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the LJSpeech dataset, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will ensure that the dataset entry is clear and complete, ready for any further processing or review.
