To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Skeleton Ground Truth Extraction" by Cong Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a tool called SkeView to generate skeleton ground truths for existing datasets, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Annotation Tool and Ground Truth)**, where the authors provide a detailed list of datasets for which they generated ground truth (GT) skeletons. They mention that they generated GTs for **17 existing shape and image datasets**. I will look for a table or a list that summarizes these datasets, as this will provide the necessary details.

In **Table 1**, the authors list the datasets along with their types and sizes. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **Animal2000**: A shape dataset containing 2,000 shapes across 20 categories.
2. **ArticulatedShapes**: A shape dataset with 40 images from eight different objects.
3. **SkelNetOn**: A shape dataset with 1,725 shapes, available only to registered participants of the SkelNetOn Challenge.
4. **Kimia99**: A shape dataset containing 99 shapes across 9 categories.
5. **MPEG7**: A shape dataset with 1,400 shapes defined by their outer closed contours.
6. **Kimia216**: A shape dataset containing 216 shapes selected from the MPEG7 dataset.
7. **MPEG400**: A shape dataset with 400 shapes selected from the MPEG7 dataset.
8. **Tetrapod120**: A shape dataset containing 120 tetrapod animal shapes from six classes.
9. **SwedishLeaves**: A shape dataset with 1,125 leaf shapes from 15 different Swedish tree species.
10. **Tari56**: A shape dataset containing 56 shapes for evaluating matching performance.
11. **SK506**: An image dataset with 506 natural images, including 16 object classes.
12. **SK1491**: An image dataset with 1,491 images, an extension of SK506.
13. **SYMMAX300**: An image dataset with 300 images used for local reflection symmetry detection.
14. **SymPASCAL**: An image dataset with 1,435 images selected from the PASCAL-VOC dataset.
15. **EM200**: An image dataset containing 200 microscopic images of environmental microorganisms.
16. **SmithsonianLeaves**: An image dataset with 343 leaves from 93 different species of plants.
17. **WH-SYMMAX**: An image dataset with 328 cropped images from the Weizmann Horse dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors often cite the original papers or sources where these datasets were introduced or described. 

For example, I will look for citations related to:

- **Animal2000**: 
  > Bai, X., Liu, W., Tu, Z. *Integrating contour and skeleton for shape classification*. In: IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops, pp. 360–367, 2009.

- **SkelNetOn**: 
  > Ilke, D., et al. *Skelneton 2019: Dataset and challenge on deep learning for geometric shape understanding*. In: IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, pp. 1–9, 2019.

- **MPEG7**: 
  > Latecki, L.J., Lakamper, R., Eckhardt, T. *Shape descriptors for non-rigid shapes with a single closed contour*. In: IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 424–429, 2000.

I will continue this process for each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring that I capture the full citation for each one.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, type, size, and full citation, ready for review or further processing.
