To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing the Interpretability of Deep Models in Healthcare Through Attention: Application to Glucose Forecasting for Diabetic People" by Maxime De Bois et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their model on two datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Methods)**, specifically **subsections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **IDIAB Dataset**: This dataset was collected by the authors themselves from 6 type-2 diabetic patients. It includes glucose values collected using FreeStyle Libre devices, along with carbohydrate intake and insulin infusion data. The ethical approval for this dataset is also noted.

2. **OhioT1DM Dataset**: This dataset was released by Marling et al. and consists of data from 6 type-1 diabetic patients. It includes glucose values, insulin infusions, and carbohydrate intakes, monitored over 8 weeks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **IDIAB Dataset**, since it was collected by the authors, I will cite it as follows:
  > De Bois, M., El Yacoubi, M. A., & Ammi, M. (2019). Glyfe. Zenodo. doi: 10.5281/zenodo.3234605.

- For the **OhioT1DM Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marling, C., & Bunescu, R. C. (2018). The OhioT1DM dataset for blood glucose level prediction. In KHD@ IJCAI (pp. 60â€“63).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research.
