To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Improving Deep Reinforcement Learning for POMDPs" by Pengfei Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of deep reinforcement learning in partially observable environments, which suggests that there may be datasets related to Atari games or other environments used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) to identify any datasets explicitly mentioned. In this section, the authors describe their evaluation setup, including the use of **flickering Atari games**. This indicates that the datasets used for training and testing are likely related to Atari games.

In **section 4.1 (Experiments setup)**, the authors mention the use of the **Atari Learning Environment (ALE)**, which is a well-known benchmark for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms. They also refer to the **flickering versions of Atari games**, which are modified versions of standard Atari games to introduce partial observability.

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

- For the **Atari Learning Environment**, the citation is:
  > Marc G. Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. J. Artif. Intell. Res. (JAIR), 47:253â€“279, 2013.

- For the **flickering Atari games**, the citation is:
  > Matthew J. Hausknecht and Peter Stone. *Deep recurrent q-learning for partially observable mdps*. CoRR, abs/1507.06527, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Atari Learning Environment**: A benchmark for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms, providing a variety of Atari games for training and testing.
2. **Flickering Atari Games**: Modified versions of standard Atari games that introduce partial observability, used to evaluate the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms in POMDP settings.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
