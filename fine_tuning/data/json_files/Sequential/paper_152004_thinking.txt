To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Recurrent NMF for Speech Separation by Unfolding Iterative Thresholding" by Scott Wisdom et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on the **CHiME2 dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is significant for the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly state that they used the **CHiME2 corpus** for their experiments. I will take note of the details provided about this dataset, including its composition and the context in which it was used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a detailed description of the CHiME2 dataset, including the number of utterances, the types of noise included, and the sampling rate. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's characteristics and its relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CHiME2 dataset. The citation is typically formatted according to the conference or journal's guidelines, and it is essential to include it in my extraction.

The citation for the CHiME2 dataset is:
> E. Vincent, J. Barker, S. Watanabe, J. Le Roux, F. Nesta, and M. Matassoni. "The second CHiME speech separation and recognition challenge: An overview of challenge systems and outcomes." In Proceedings of the ASRU, Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2013, pp. 162â€“167.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the dataset extraction as follows:

1. **CHiME2 Dataset**: This dataset consists of utterances from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ-0) dataset that have been convolved with binaural room impulse responses and mixed with real-world nonstationary noise at various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The training set includes 7138 utterances, the development set has 2460 utterances, and the test set contains 1980 utterances, all sampled at 16kHz.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset details along with the full citation, ensuring that all necessary information is included for future reference or analysis.
