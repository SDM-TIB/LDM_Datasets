To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Linguistic Knowledge in Data Augmentation for Natural Language Processing: An Example on Chinese Question Matching" by Zhengxiang Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses the **LCQMC (Large-scale Chinese Question Matching Corpus)** for a binary Chinese question matching classification task. This is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look into the **experimental setup** section, specifically **section 3.1**, where the authors provide details about the LCQMC dataset. Here, they describe the dataset as containing over 260,000 question pairs extracted from BaiduKnows, with annotations indicating whether the question pairs match in terms of expressed intents. They also mention the dataset's structure, including the training, development, and test splits.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide basic statistics about the LCQMC dataset, detailing the total number of pairs, matched pairs, and mismatched pairs across the training, development, and test sets. This reinforces the importance of the LCQMC dataset in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the LCQMC dataset. The authors cite the original paper that introduced the dataset:

- For **LCQMC**, the citation is:
  > Liu, P., Wang, X., Xiang, C., & Meng, W. (2018). LCQMC: A large-scale Chinese question matching corpus. In Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (pp. 1952â€“1962). Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset in a structured manner, ensuring to include the full citation as it is crucial for proper attribution.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for LCQMC, ensuring that it is ready for any further processing or review.
