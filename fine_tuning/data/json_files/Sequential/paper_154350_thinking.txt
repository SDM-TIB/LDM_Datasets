To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Benefits of Early Fusion in Multimodal Representation Learning" by George Barnum et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on multimodal learning, but I need to dig deeper into the body of the paper for specific dataset information.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention the construction of a multimodal dataset based on two well-known datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is widely recognized for handwritten digit recognition tasks. The authors reference the original work by Yann LeCun et al. (2010) for this dataset.

2. **Free Spoken Digit Dataset**: This dataset is used for audio recognition tasks and is cited from the work by Zohar Jackson et al. (2018).

The authors explain how they combined these datasets to create a multimodal dataset for their experiments, which allows for the manipulation of task difficulty through the addition of noise.

Now, I will retrieve the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and CJ Burges. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. ATT Labs [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist, 2010.

- For the **Free Spoken Digit Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zohar Jackson, CÃ©sar Souza, Jason Flaks, Yuxin Pan, Hereman Nicolas, and Adhish Thite. *Jakobovski/free-spoken-digit-dataset: v1.0.8*, August 2018. URL https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1342401.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for further processing or review.
