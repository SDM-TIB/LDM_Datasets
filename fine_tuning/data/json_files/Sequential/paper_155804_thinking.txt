To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CRU: A Novel Neural Architecture for Improving the Predictive Performance of Time-Series Data" by Sunghyun Sim et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method was evaluated using five univariate and four multivariate time-series datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors summarize the datasets used. In this case, they provide a table (Table 1) that lists the datasets along with their characteristics. I will extract the relevant information from this table, which includes:

1. **UTD1**: US GDP
2. **UTD2**: S&P 500
3. **UTD3**: Google Stock Price
4. **UTD4**: Baltic Dry Bulk Index
5. **UTD5**: EU Emissions Trading System Price
6. **MTD1**: Big Tech Stock Price
7. **MTD2**: Baltic Exchange Dry Index
8. **MTD3**: Major World Stock Indices
9. **MTD4**: Major World Trade Volume

I will also note the data types (univariate or multivariate), the number of rows and columns, the collected duration, and a brief description of each dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution. For example, the GDP data might be cited from the World Bank, while stock prices could be sourced from Yahoo! Finance.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as per the requirements.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
