To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ARMIN: Towards a More Efficient and Light-weight Recurrent Memory Network" by Zhangheng Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments. The introduction often discusses the background and may reference datasets used in prior work, which can guide me in identifying relevant datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets or data sources. In this paper, the authors evaluate their model on algorithmic tasks and character-level language modeling tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In section 4.1 (Algorithmic Tasks), the authors mention using a set of synthetic algorithm tasks introduced by Graves et al. (2014). However, they do not provide a specific dataset name, as these tasks are synthetic. I will note that while these tasks are important for evaluation, they do not correspond to a traditional dataset with a citation.

In section 4.2 (Permuted Pixel-by-pixel MNIST Classification), the authors refer to the **MNIST dataset**. This is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit classification. I will extract the relevant details about this dataset.

In section 4.3 (Character-level Language Modelling), the authors mention benchmarking their network over the **Penn Treebank** and **Hutter Prize Wikipedia (enwik8)** datasets. I will gather information about these datasets as well.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **MNIST Dataset**:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

2. **Penn Treebank**:
   > Marcus, Mitchell P., Beatrice Santorini, and Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz. *Building a Large Annotated Corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2):313-330, 1993.

3. **Hutter Prize Wikipedia (enwik8)**:
   > Hutter, Marcus. *The Hutter Prize for Lossless Compression*. [http://prize.hutter1.net/](http://prize.hutter1.net/)

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **MNIST Dataset**: A dataset of handwritten digits used for classification tasks.
- **Penn Treebank**: A dataset used for language modeling and syntactic parsing.
- **Hutter Prize Wikipedia (enwik8)**: A dataset used for benchmarking compression algorithms.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately represented for future reference or processing.
