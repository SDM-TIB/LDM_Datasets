To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Oscillatory Fourier Neural Network: A Compact and Efficient Architecture for Sequential Processing" by Bing Han, Cheng Wang, and Kaushik Roy, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions applying the proposed model to sentiment analysis on the **IMDB review dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is relevant.

Next, I will examine the **results section** where the authors discuss their experiments. They specifically mention using the **IMDB dataset** for sentiment analysis, which contains 50,000 movie reviews labeled as either positive or negative. This dataset is split evenly for training and testing, with 25,000 reviews for each.

Additionally, I will look for other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors also refer to the **permuted sequential MNIST dataset (psMNIST)**, which is a modified version of the MNIST dataset where a fixed permutation is applied to the stream of individual pixels. This dataset is used for digit classification tasks.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the **noise padded CIFAR-10 dataset**, which presents challenges for models due to the presence of Gaussian noise in most of the input sequence. Lastly, the authors mention the **HAR-2 dataset** for human activity recognition.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **references section** of the paper:

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
