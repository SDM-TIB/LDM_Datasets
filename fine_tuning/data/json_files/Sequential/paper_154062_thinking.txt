To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SMART: Simultaneous Multi-Agent Recurrent Trajectory Prediction" by Sriram N N et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their approach using both simulated datasets and existing real datasets of traffic scenes. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look closely at the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluation. They specifically mention using the **Argoverse Tracking (ArgoT)** and **Argoverse Forecasting (ArgoF)** datasets. The paper states that they introduce a simulated dataset based on ArgoT, referred to as **P-ArgoT**, which contains 2044 scenes with multiple trajectories for every scene.

I will also check the **related work section** for any additional datasets mentioned. The authors reference several datasets relevant to autonomous driving, including **KITTI**, **NGSIM**, and **Waymo Open Dataset**, but the primary datasets used in their experiments are ArgoT, ArgoF, and P-ArgoT.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **Argoverse Tracking (ArgoT)**:
   > Chang, M.F., Lambert, J., Sangkloy, P., Singh, J., Bak, S., Hartnett, A., Wang, D., Carr, P., Lucey, S., Ramanan, D., Hays, J. "Argoverse: 3D tracking and forecasting with rich maps." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019.

2. **Argoverse Forecasting (ArgoF)**:
   > Chang, M.F., Lambert, J., Sangkloy, P., Singh, J., Bak, S., Hartnett, A., Wang, D., Carr, P., Lucey, S., Ramanan, D., Hays, J. "Argoverse: 3D tracking and forecasting with rich maps." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019.

3. **P-ArgoT** (simulated dataset based on ArgoT):
   > This dataset is derived from the ArgoT dataset and does not have a separate citation, as it is a product of the authors' simulation methodology described in the paper.

4. **KITTI Dataset**:
   > Geiger, A., Lenz, P., Stiller, C., Urtasun, R. "Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset." International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR), 2013.

5. **Waymo Open Dataset**:
   > Waymo Open Dataset: An autonomous driving dataset. Waymo LLC, 2019.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
