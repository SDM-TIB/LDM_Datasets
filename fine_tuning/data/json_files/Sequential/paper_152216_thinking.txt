To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transition-Based Parsing with Context Enhancement and Future Reward Reranking" by Fugen Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not detail specific datasets. The introduction often contextualizes the research and may reference datasets used in prior work, which could be relevant.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention that they conduct experiments on the **English Penn Treebank (PTB)** and **Chinese Treebank (CTB)**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are central to their research.

In **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors provide specific details about the datasets:
- **English Penn Treebank (PTB)**: The authors mention using the standard splits for training, testing, and development.
- **Chinese Treebank (CTB)**: Similarly, they refer to the standard splits for this dataset as well.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and should be formatted correctly. 

For the **Penn Treebank (PTB)**, the citation is:
> Marcus, M. P., Santorini, B., & Marcinkiewicz, M. A. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313-330.

For the **Chinese Treebank (CTB)**, the citation is:
> Xue, N., Xia, F., Chiou, F. D., & Palmer, M. (2005). The Penn Chinese Treebank: Phrase structure annotation of a large corpus. *Natural Language Engineering*, 11(2), 207-238.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or integration into other systems.
