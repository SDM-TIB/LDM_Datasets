To extract datasets from the research paper titled "INFINITY: A Simple Yet Effective Unsupervised Framework for Graph-Text Mutual Conversion" by Yi Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look specifically at **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention that they performed extensive experiments on two benchmarks: **WebNLG** and **GenWiki**. 

I will then gather detailed information about each dataset:

1. **WebNLG**: The authors describe it as widely used for text generation and relation extraction, with each graph containing about 2 to 7 triples. They provide statistics indicating that the training set consists of 18,102 instances, with validation and test sets containing 872 and 1,862 instances, respectively. The dataset has 373 relation types.

2. **GenWiki**: This dataset is noted as a new resource for unsupervised G2T generation, with a training set of 48,020 instances, a validation set of 1,000, and a test set of 10,000. It contains 250 relation types.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **WebNLG**, the citation is:
  > Claire Gardent, Anastasia Shimorina, Shashi Narayan, and Laura Perez-Beltrachini. *The WebNLG Challenge: Generating Text from RDF Data*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Natural Language Generation (INLG), 2017.

- For **GenWiki**, the citation is:
  > Zhijing Jin, Qipeng Guo, Xipeng Qiu, and Zheng Zhang. *GenWiki: A Dataset of 1.3 Million Content-Sharing Text and Graphs for Unsupervised Graph-to-Text Generation*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING), 2020.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
