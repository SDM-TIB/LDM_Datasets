To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Search: Learning Query and Product Representations in Fashion E-commerce" by Sagnik Sarkar and Lakshya Kumar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it discusses the use of user click-stream data, it does not explicitly name any datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors mention using **60 days of click-stream data** to prepare the Query-Product and Product-Product graphs. This indicates that the dataset is derived from user interactions on the Myntra platform.

In **section 4.1 (Dataset Description)**, the authors provide more specifics about the dataset. They mention that the resulting data contains approximately **140,000 unique queries** and **950,000 products**. They also describe how the data is split into training and testing sets, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will look for any references to external datasets or sources that might be cited in the paper. The **References section** will be essential for this. However, it appears that the primary dataset used is the click-stream data from Myntra, which may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will summarize the main dataset used:

1. **Myntra Click-Stream Data**: This dataset consists of user interaction data over a period of 60 days, which includes approximately 140,000 unique queries and 950,000 products. It is used to create Query-Product and Product-Product graphs for training the models.

As there are no formal citations for this dataset in the references, I will note that it is proprietary data from Myntra and does not have a standard citation format.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's key attributes, ensuring to mention that it is proprietary data from Myntra without a formal citation.

After completing this process, I will have a clear understanding of the datasets used in the research paper and their significance in the context of the experiments conducted.
