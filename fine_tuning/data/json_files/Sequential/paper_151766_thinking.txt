To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sharp Nearby, Fuzzy Far Away: How Neural Language Models Use Context" by Urvashi Khandelwal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors analyze the role of context in an LSTM language model using two standard datasets: **Penn Treebank** and **WikiText-2**. This indicates that these datasets are central to the research and should be included in my extraction.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention the datasets in the **approach section**. They describe the **Penn Treebank (PTB)** and **WikiText-2 (Wiki)** datasets, providing some statistics about them, such as the number of tokens and vocabulary size.

1. **Penn Treebank (PTB)**: The authors describe it as consisting of Wall Street Journal news articles with 0.9 million tokens for training and a vocabulary of 10,000 words.

2. **WikiText-2 (Wiki)**: This dataset is characterized as larger and more diverse, containing Wikipedia articles with 2.1 million tokens for training and a vocabulary of 33,000 words.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **Penn Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Mitchell P Marcus, Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz, and Beatrice Santorini. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2):313â€“330, 1993. [http://aclweb.org/anthology/J93-2004](http://aclweb.org/anthology/J93-2004).

- For **WikiText-2**, the citation is:
  > Stephen Merity, Nitish Shirish Keskar, and Richard Socher. *Regularizing and Optimizing LSTM Language Models*. International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2018. [https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyyGPP0TZ](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyyGPP0TZ).

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its citation included.

In summary, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations for both the **Penn Treebank** and **WikiText-2** datasets, ready for further processing or review.
