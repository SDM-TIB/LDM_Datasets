To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dual Rectified Linear Units (DReLUs): A Replacement for Tanh Activation Functions in Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks" by Frédéric Godina et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions but may not specify datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and may mention datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors describe their evaluation on three different natural language processing tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In **subsection 4.1 (Sentiment Classification)**, the authors mention using the **IMDb movie review dataset** for sentiment classification. This dataset is described as containing 25,000 positive and 25,000 negative reviews, split into training and testing sets.

In **subsection 4.2 (Word-level Language Modeling)**, the authors refer to the **Penn Treebank dataset** for evaluating word-level language modeling. This dataset is a well-known benchmark in natural language processing.

In **subsection 4.3 (Character-level Language Modeling)**, the authors mention using two datasets: the **Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset** and the **enwik8/Hutter Prize dataset**. The PTB dataset is used for character-level language modeling, while the enwik8 dataset contains 100 million characters extracted from Wikipedia.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **IMDb movie review dataset**, the citation is:
   > Maas, A. L., Daly, R. E., Pham, P. T., Huang, D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2011). Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (ACL-HLT) (pp. 142–150).

2. For the **Penn Treebank dataset**, the citation is:
   > Marcus, M. P., Marcinkiewicz, M. A., & Santorini, B. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. Computational Linguistics, 19, 313–330.

3. For the **enwik8/Hutter Prize dataset**, the citation is:
   > Hutter, M. (2012). Human knowledge compression contest. URL: http://prize.hutter1.net/.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
