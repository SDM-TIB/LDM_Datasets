To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dilated U-net based approach for multichannel speech enhancement from First-Order Ambisonics recordings" by Amélie Bosca et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often discusses the context and previous works, which might reference datasets used in related studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and validation. Here, the authors mention that the speech data comes from the **BREF database** and noise data is sourced from **freesound.org**. This indicates that these are the datasets utilized in their experiments.

I will then look for any additional details about these datasets in the text. The authors specify that the speech data is from the BREF database, which is a large vocabulary spoken corpus for French. They also mention using simulated Spatial Room Impulse Responses (SRIRs) for training, which is important for understanding the experimental setup.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **BREF database**, the citation is:
   > L. F. Lamel, J.-L. Gauvain, and M. Eskénazi. "BREF, a large vocabulary spoken corpus for French." In Proc. of Eurospeech, 1991, pp. 505–508.

2. For the noise data from **freesound.org**, since it is a website and not a traditional dataset publication, I will note it as:
   > Freesound.org. "A collaborative database of Creative Commons Licensed sounds." [Online]. Available: https://freesound.org.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or processing.
