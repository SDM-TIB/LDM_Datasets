To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-task Learning for Target-dependent Sentiment Classification" by Divam Gupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using two auxiliary datasets and three benchmark datasets, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used. In **section 4.1 (Datasets for auxiliary SC task)**, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Go Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1.6 million tweets that are automatically annotated using emoticons, categorizing sentiments into positive and negative classes.

2. **Sanders Dataset**: This dataset contains 5,513 manually annotated tweets across three sentiment classes.

Then, I will look at **section 4.2 (Datasets for main TDSC task)**, where the authors describe three datasets:

1. **Dong Dataset**: This dataset includes tweets with target entities marked and sentiment labels associated with each target. It contains 6,248 training instances and 692 test instances.

2. **Election1 Dataset**: Derived from tweets about the UK election, this dataset has 3,210 training tweets and 867 testing tweets, with a highly unbalanced class distribution.

3. **Election2 Dataset**: This is a new dataset introduced by the authors, based on tweets related to the UK General Elections, containing 563,812 tweets after filtering.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations I need to gather are:

- For the **Go Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Go, A., Bhayani, R., & Huang, L. (2009). Twitter sentiment classification using distant supervision. CS224N Project Report, Stanford, 1(2009):12.

- For the **Sanders Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sanders, N. (2011). Twitter sentiment corpus.

- For the **Dong Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dong, L., Wei, F., Tan, C., Tang, D., Zhou, M., & Xu, K. (2014). Adaptive recursive neural network for target-dependent Twitter sentiment classification. In Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 49–54.

- For the **Election1 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, B., Liakata, M., Zubiaga, A., & Procter, R. (2017). TDParse: Multi-target-specific sentiment recognition on Twitter. In Proceedings of the EACL, pages 483–493.

- For the **Election2 Dataset**, since it is introduced in this paper, I will cite it as:
  > Gupta, D., Singh, K., Chakrabarti, S., & Chakraborty, T. (2023). Multi-task Learning for Target-dependent Sentiment Classification. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
