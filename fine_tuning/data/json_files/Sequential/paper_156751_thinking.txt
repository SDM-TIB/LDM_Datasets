To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Generalized Hydrological Forecasting using Transformer Models for 120-Hour Streamflow Prediction" by Bekir Z. Demiraya and Ibrahim Demira, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and case study and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study utilizes data from 125 diverse locations in Iowa, which suggests that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Case Study and Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used in their research. They introduce **WaterBench-Iowa**, developed by Demir et al. (2022), as the foundational dataset for their study. This dataset is designed for hydrological forecasting and includes a comprehensive collection of hydrological and meteorological data from 125 locations in Iowa, covering a period from October 2011 to September 2018.

I will note the key features of the **WaterBench-Iowa dataset**:
- It includes streamflow measurements, precipitation records, watershed characteristics, slope, soil types, and evapotranspiration data.
- The dataset is structured to support various machine learning and deep learning methodologies.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the **WaterBench-Iowa dataset** in the **References section**. The citation is as follows:
> Demir, I., Xiang, Z., Demiray, B., and Sit, M. (2022). WaterBench-Iowa: a large-scale benchmark dataset for data-driven streamflow forecasting. *Earth System Science Data*, 14(12), pp. 5605-5616.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about the dataset, including its name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for **WaterBench-Iowa**, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and structured representation of the dataset used in the research.
