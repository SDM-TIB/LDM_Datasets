To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combining Visible Light and Infrared Imaging for Efficient Detection of Respiratory Infections Such as COVID-19 on Portable Device" by Zheng Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors performed validation experiments on a real-world dataset, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant mentions in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their data collection process in the **experiments section**. They mention that the data was collected from patients in the respiratory disease department and cardiology department at Ruijin Hospital, which is crucial information.

I will note the specifics of the dataset mentioned:
- The dataset consists of **1,925 healthy breathing data** and **2,292 abnormal breathing data**, totaling **4,217 data samples**. Each sample includes **100 frames of infrared and RGB videos** collected over **10 seconds**.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **references section** for any papers that describe the datasets used. The authors mention that the dataset is not collected from COVID-19 patients but from inpatients with basic or chronic respiratory diseases. However, they do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, which is common in research papers when the dataset is original or proprietary.

Since the authors plan to release the dataset for non-commercial users once the paper is accepted, I will note that down as well, as it indicates the dataset's availability for future research.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper itself, as it serves as the primary source of the dataset information.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Zheng Jiang, Menghan Hu, Lei Fan, Yaling Pan, Wei Tang, Guangtao Zhai, and Yong Lu. *Combining Visible Light and Infrared Imaging for Efficient Detection of Respiratory Infections Such as COVID-19 on Portable Device*. 

In summary, I have identified the dataset's characteristics and the context in which it was collected, and I have the citation for the paper. I will now prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing.
