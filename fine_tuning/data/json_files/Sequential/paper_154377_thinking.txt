To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Implicit Templates for 3D Shape Representation" by Zerong Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and I will look for any mentions of datasets or benchmarks that the authors used to validate their methods.

In the **introduction**, I will pay attention to any references to datasets that might be used for training or evaluation. The authors often mention datasets in the context of related work or the significance of their contributions.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. This section often includes specific names, sizes, and characteristics of the datasets, which are crucial for my extraction.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **ShapeNet dataset** for training their model. They refer to it as a comprehensive repository of 3D models, which is a key dataset in the field of 3D shape representation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ShapeNet dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Angel X. Chang, Thomas A. Funkhouser, Leonidas J. Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qi-Xing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Hao Su, Jianxiong Xiao, Li Yi, and Fisher Yu. *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. CoRR, abs/1512.03012, 2015.

I will also look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper, such as the **D-FAUST dataset**, which is referenced in the context of correspondence loss experiments. I will locate its citation as well:
> Federica Bogo, Javier Romero, Gerard Pons-Moll, and Michael J. Black. *Dynamic FAUST: Registering human bodies in motion*. In IEEE Conf. on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), July 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
