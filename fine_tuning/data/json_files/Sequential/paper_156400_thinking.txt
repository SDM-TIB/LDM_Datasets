To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Activity Sparsity Complements Weight Sparsity for Efficient RNN Inference" by Rishav Mukherji et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of the **Penn Treebank** language modeling task, which suggests that this dataset is likely to be one of the key datasets used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **results section** (section 4) where the authors discuss their findings. In section 4, they explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation, which are:

1. **Penn Treebank**: This dataset is referenced multiple times throughout the paper, particularly in the context of language modeling performance metrics.
2. **WikiText-2**: This dataset is also mentioned as a benchmark for evaluating their methods.

To confirm the details about these datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Penn Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Mitchell P. Marcus, Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz, and Beatrice Santorini. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Comput. Linguist., 19(2):313â€“330, 1993.

- For the **WikiText-2**, the citation is:
  > Stephen Merity, Nitish Shirish Keskar, and Richard Socher. *Regularizing and optimizing LSTM language models*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2018. URL https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyyGPP0TZ.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Penn Treebank**: A widely used dataset for language modeling tasks, providing a large annotated corpus of English.
2. **WikiText-2**: Another language modeling dataset that serves as a benchmark for evaluating language models.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citations are included for each dataset.
