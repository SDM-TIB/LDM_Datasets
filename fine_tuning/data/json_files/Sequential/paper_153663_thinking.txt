To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FiniteNet: A Fully Convolutional LSTM Network Architecture for Time-Dependent Partial Differential Equations" by Ben Stevens and Tim Colonius, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the use of a machine learning approach for solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs), but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors describe their experimental setup and results. Here, they mention training the network on simulation data and comparing it against baseline numerical methods. However, they do not specify any datasets by name in this section either.

I will then check the **methodology section** (section 4) to see if there are any references to specific datasets used for training or testing. The authors describe the equations they are working with (linear advection, inviscid Burgers', and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations) but do not provide specific dataset names.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will look at the **References section** to see if any of the cited works include datasets that might be relevant. The references include various papers on numerical methods and machine learning approaches, but again, they do not specify datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors did not use publicly available datasets but rather generated their own simulation data for training and testing their model. Therefore, I will note that there are no specific datasets to cite from this paper.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings:
- The paper does not mention any specific datasets by name.
- The authors used simulation data generated from the equations they are studying.
- No citations for datasets can be provided as none are referenced.

This process highlights the importance of carefully reviewing all sections of a research paper to identify any datasets, even if they are not explicitly named. In this case, I will document that no datasets were found in the paper.
