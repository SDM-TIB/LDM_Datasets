To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The RepEval 2017 Shared Task: Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference with Sentence Representations" by Nikita Nangia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the evaluation of models on the **Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference corpus (MultiNLI)**, which indicates that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the **MultiNLI** dataset. They explain that it consists of 393,000 pairs of sentences from various genres, balanced across three labels (entailment, neutral, contradiction). This section provides essential details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MultiNLI dataset. The authors attribute the dataset to Williams et al. (2017), which I will need to cite properly.

The citation for the MultiNLI dataset is:
> Adina Williams, Nikita Nangia, and Samuel R. Bowman. *A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference*. CoRR abs/1704.05426, 2017.

Additionally, the paper mentions the **Stanford NLI Corpus (SNLI)** as a related dataset, which is also relevant. I will look for its citation in the references.

The citation for the SNLI dataset is:
> Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 632â€“640, 2015.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for both datasets. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
