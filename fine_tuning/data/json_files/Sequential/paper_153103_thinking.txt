To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving LSTM Neural Networks for Better Short-Term Wind Power Predictions" by Maximilian Du, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of weather forecast data and wind power data, which suggests that these may be the datasets of interest. The introduction provides context about the importance of wind power prediction, but I need to look for specific dataset names and details.

Next, I will examine the **data acquisition and processing section (III)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. Here, the author mentions two key datasets:

1. **NREL Wind Power Data**: This dataset is sourced from the National Renewable Energy Laboratories (NREL) and is used for training and testing the models. It is noted that this dataset contains wind power data in five-minute increments.

2. **RAP Weather Data**: The weather forecast data is obtained from the Rapid Refresh (RAP) database provided by NOAA. This dataset includes various weather parameters relevant to wind power generation.

In the **results and analysis section (VI)**, the author discusses the impact of these datasets on model performance, confirming their significance in the experiments conducted.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **NREL Wind Power Data**, the citation is:
  > NREL wind prospector database. maps.nrel.gov/wind-prospector, 2010.

- For the **RAP Weather Data**, the citation is:
  > Rapid refresh (RAP) weather database. www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/rapid-refresh-rap, 2010.

With these citations, I can now compile the dataset entries. I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described, including its source and relevance to the study.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or processing.
