To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reducing Discontinuous to Continuous Parsing with Pointer Network Reordering" by Daniel Fernández-González and Carlos Gómez-Rodríguez, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the conversion of discontinuous trees to continuous ones and mentions experiments on "the main benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors specify the datasets used for their experiments. They mention testing their approach on two German discontinous treebanks, **NEGRA** and **TIGER**, as well as the **discontinuous English Penn Treebank (DPTB)**. This indicates that these are the datasets relevant to their research.

In the **appendices**, specifically Appendix A.1, the authors provide details about the treebank splits for these datasets, confirming their usage in the experiments. 

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section**:

1. **NEGRA Treebank**: 
   > Skut, Wojciech, Brigitte Krenn, Thorsten Brants, and Hans Uszkoreit. *An annotation scheme for free word order languages*. In Proceedings of the Fifth Conference on Applied Natural Language Processing, ANLC ’97, pages 88–95, Stroudsburg, PA, USA. Association for Computational Linguistics, 1997.

2. **TIGER Treebank**: 
   > Brants, Sabine, Stefanie Dipper, Silvia Hansen, Wolfgang Lezius, and George Smith. *TIGER treebank*. In Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Treebanks and Linguistic Theories (TLT), pages 24–42, 2002.

3. **Discontinuous English Penn Treebank (DPTB)**: 
   > Evang, Kilian, and Laura Kallmeyer. *PLCFRS parsing of English discontinuous constituents*. In Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Parsing Technologies, pages 104–116, Dublin, Ireland. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2011.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **NEGRA Treebank**: A German treebank that captures discontinuous constituents and is used for parsing tasks.
- **TIGER Treebank**: Another German treebank that provides annotated syntactic structures for parsing.
- **DPTB**: An English treebank that has been adapted to include discontinuous constituents for parsing research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
