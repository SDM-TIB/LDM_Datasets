To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Human Activity Recognition using Multi-Head CNN followed by LSTM" by Waqar Ahmad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but the **dataset section** is where I expect to find detailed information about the datasets used.

In **section III (Dataset)**, the authors explicitly mention the dataset they utilized: the **UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset**. They describe how the dataset was collected from 30 individuals performing six different activities while carrying a smartphone equipped with inertial sensors. This section provides essential details about the dataset, including the types of data collected (tri-axial acceleration and gyroscope data) and the preprocessing steps taken.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the UCI dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra, and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. “A Public Domain Dataset for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones”, ESANN 2013.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset**: This dataset includes data collected from 30 participants aged 19 to 48 years, performing six activities: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying. The data is processed and sampled at a rate of 50Hz, with a window size of 2.5 seconds and a 50% overlap.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper referencing. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture all necessary details about the dataset used in the research paper.
