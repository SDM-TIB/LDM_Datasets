To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revisiting the Hierarchical Multiscale LSTM" by Ákos Kádár et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and may mention datasets used for experiments. In this case, the authors discuss the reproduction of results on two datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors specifically mention using the **Penn Treebank** and **Text8** datasets for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and any specific configurations used during the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the Penn Treebank dataset as a smaller-scale dataset used for language modeling, and they provide details about how it was processed and utilized. They also describe the Text8 dataset, which is a larger dataset extracted from Wikipedia, specifying how it was split for training, validation, and testing.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets easily. 

For the **Penn Treebank**, the citation is:
> Mitchell P. Marcus, Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz, and Beatrice Santorini. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2):313–330, 1993.

For the **Text8 dataset**, the citation is:
> Matt Mahoney. *Large Text Compression Benchmark*. URL: http://www.mattmahoney.net/text/text.html, 2011.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the details provided. This will prepare me to compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
