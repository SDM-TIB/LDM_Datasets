To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explainable Artificial Intelligence Techniques for Irregular Temporal Classification of Multidrug Resistance Acquisition in Intensive Care Unit Patients" by Ã“scar Escudero-Arnanza et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of data from Electronic Health Records (EHR) of ICU patients, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Database and Data Preparation)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used in their study. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of longitudinal clinical data spanning 17 years from the University Hospital of Fuenlabrada (UHF) in Spain, covering 3,502 patients admitted to the ICU.

In this section, the authors describe the dataset's structure, including the types of features collected, such as culture-related features, antibiotic treatments, ICU occupancy, and individual patient care variables. They also explain how the data was processed and the criteria for labeling patients as MDR or non-MDR.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. However, since the dataset is derived from the authors' own collection of EHR data, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note that the dataset is based on EHR data from the UHF.

The relevant dataset information I will extract includes:

1. **Dataset Name**: University Hospital of Fuenlabrada EHR Dataset
   - **Description**: Longitudinal clinical data from 3,502 ICU patients over 17 years, including features related to cultures, antibiotic treatments, ICU occupancy, and patient care.
   - **Citation**: Not applicable (derived from internal hospital records).

Since the dataset is not formally published, I will indicate that it is based on internal data from the University Hospital of Fuenlabrada.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
