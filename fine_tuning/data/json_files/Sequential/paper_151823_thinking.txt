To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "DDRprog: A CLEVR Differentiable Dynamic Reasoning Programmer" by Joseph Suarez et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and the datasets section** of the paper. The abstract mentions a novel framework applied to CLEVR Visual Question Answering and reverse Polish notation expression evaluation, indicating that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. The section is divided into two subsections:

1. **CLEVR Dataset**: The authors describe CLEVR as a synthetic visual question answering dataset consisting of 100,000 images and 1 million question/answer pairs. They emphasize its design to encourage discrete reasoning through functional program annotations.

2. **RPN Dataset**: The authors introduce the reverse Polish notation (RPN) expression evaluation dataset, detailing its structure and the number of training, validation, and test expressions. They explain the complexity of the task and how it is designed to motivate additional supervision.

After identifying the datasets, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **CLEVR dataset**, the citation is:
  > Johnson, Justin, Hariharan, Bharath, van der Maaten, Laurens, Fei-Fei, Li, Zitnick, C. Lawrence, and Girshick, Ross B. *CLEVR: A diagnostic dataset for compositional language and elementary visual reasoning*. CoRR, abs/1612.06890, 2016. URL http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06890.

- For the **RPN dataset**, since it is introduced in this paper and does not have a separate citation, I will note that it is a novel dataset created by the authors for their specific research.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.
