To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sense representations for Portuguese: experiments with sense embeddings and deep neural language models" by Jéssica Rodrigues da Silva and Helena de M. Caseli, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the generation of sense embeddings and the evaluation of pre-trained deep neural language models, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in these experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In **Section 4.1 (Training corpus)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the corpus used for training sense embeddings, which includes various sources of Portuguese texts. They mention the following datasets:

1. **LX-Corpus**: A mixed genre corpus containing 714,286,638 tokens and 2,605,393 types.
2. **Wikipedia**: An encyclopedic corpus with 219,293,003 tokens and 1,758,191 types.
3. **Google News**: An informative corpus with 160,396,456 tokens and 664,320 types.
4. **SubIMDB-PT**: A spoken language corpus with 129,975,149 tokens and 500,302 types.
5. **PLN-Br**: An informative corpus with 31,196,395 tokens and 259,762 types.
6. **Literacy works of public domain**: A prose corpus with 23,750,521 tokens and 381,697 types.
7. **Various other smaller corpora**: Including e-books, didactic texts, and informative texts.

In **Section 4.3 (Evaluation)**, the authors mention specific datasets used for evaluation tasks:

1. **Syntactic and Semantic Analogies Dataset**: This dataset is used for intrinsic evaluation and contains analogies in Brazilian (PT-BR) and European (PT-EU) Portuguese.
2. **ASSIN Dataset**: Used for the Semantic Textual Similarity task, which includes training and test sets for Brazilian and European Portuguese.
3. **CSTNews Dataset**: This dataset contains 50 collections of journalistic documents in Brazilian Portuguese, annotated with meanings from WordNet, used for the Word Sense Disambiguation task.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper:

- For **LX-Corpus**:

- For **ASSIN Dataset**:
  > ASSIN. (2016). Avaliação de Similaridade Semântica e Inferência Textual. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Semantic Textual Similarity.

After collecting this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
