To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BATS: Binary ArchitecTure Search" by Adrian Bulat et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that their method sets a new state-of-the-art for binary neural networks on **CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet datasets**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to gather more details about how these datasets were used. The authors mention that they conducted experiments on three different image classification datasets: **CIFAR10**, **CIFAR100**, and **ImageNet**. They also provide specific details about the architecture search being carried out on CIFAR-10 and tested on all three datasets.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Tech. rep. (2009).

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.J., Li, K., Fei-Fei, L. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248â€“255, 2009.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now summarize the datasets:

1. **CIFAR10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10, but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
3. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with over 14 million images categorized into thousands of classes.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names and their full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
