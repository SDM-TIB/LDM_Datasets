To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Synthesis-based Imaging-Differentiation Representation Learning for Multi-Sequence 3D/4D MRI" by Luyi Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The authors state that they conducted experiments using three datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on the **Introduction** and **Experimental Results** sections, particularly section 4.1, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. Here, they describe three datasets:

1. **Toy Dataset**: This dataset consists of 20,000 simulated subjects, with a specific focus on recognizing different alphabets between two sequences. The authors mention the training, validation, and testing splits, which is useful for understanding its structure.

2. **BraTS2021 Dataset**: This dataset includes brain MRI images from 1,251 patients, with four sequences available for each patient (T1, T1Gd, T2, and Flair). The authors provide details about the annotations and the clinical context, which is essential for understanding its application.

3. **In-house Dataset**: This dataset comprises 2,101 patients with breast cancer, collected over a span of years. The authors describe the various MRI sequences included and the clinical relevance of the data, which is crucial for its citation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Toy Dataset**, since it is simulated and does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is a custom dataset created for the study.

- For the **BraTS2021 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ujjwal Baid, Satyam Ghodasara, Suyash Mohan, Michel Bilello, Evan Calabrese, Errol Colak, Keyvan Farahani, Jayashree Kalpathy-Cramer, Felipe C Kitamura, Sarthak Pati, et al. *The rsna-asnr-miccai brats 2021 benchmark on brain tumor segmentation and radiogenomic classification*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2107.02314, 2021.

- For the **In-house Dataset**, as it is a proprietary dataset collected by the authors, it may not have a formal citation. I will note that it is an in-house dataset used for the study.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or analysis.
