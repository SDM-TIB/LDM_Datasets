To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Single-Path NAS: Device-Aware Efficient ConvNet Design" by Dimitrios Stamoulis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the design of a ConvNet and mentions achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet, which suggests that ImageNet is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup and mention that they applied their method to design ConvNets for image classification on **ImageNet**. This confirms that ImageNet is indeed a dataset used in their research.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **ImageNet**: 
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., and Fei-Fei, L. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 248â€“255. IEEE, 2009.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the ImageNet dataset.

After this, I will prepare the dataset entry for ImageNet, ready for any further processing or review.
