To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LSTM-Based ECG Classification for Continuous Monitoring on Personal Wearable Devices" by Saeed Saadatnejad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a novel ECG classification algorithm and mentions that the algorithm is evaluated using ECG signals, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention using the **MIT-BIH ECG arrhythmia database** for evaluating their algorithm. This is a significant dataset for ECG classification tasks.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the dataset used for training and testing. They specify that the training data consists of local ECG data from patients and global ECG data from the MIT-BIH database. They also mention that the test data is all records in the DS200 subset of the MIT-BIH database.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MIT-BIH ECG arrhythmia database. The citation is as follows:
> R. G. Mark and G. B. Moody. (1997) MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. [Online]. Available: http://ecg.mit.edu/dbinfo.html

Additionally, I will note that the authors refer to two sets of data within the MIT-BIH database: **DS100** and **DS200**. However, the primary dataset they utilize for their experiments is the **MIT-BIH ECG arrhythmia database** as a whole.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MIT-BIH ECG arrhythmia database in my final output. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced accurately in future work.
