To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contextual Relationship-based Activity Segmentation on an Event Stream in the IoT Environment with Multi-user Activities" by Minkyoung Cho et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses human activity recognition in the IoT environment, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction provides context but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using their own IoT environment and collecting data over a period of nine months. They state that the dataset consists of **6,843 events generated from 436 activities**. This indicates that they have created a dataset for their experiments, but I need to find more details.

In this section, they also mention that the event stream was segmented manually for learning the true segment boundaries. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset. I will note that this dataset is crucial for their experiments but lacks a formal citation.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any external datasets are cited that may have been used in their work. However, the references primarily focus on related works and methodologies rather than specific datasets.

Since the authors do not provide a formal citation for their dataset, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

1. **IoT Activity Dataset**: This dataset was collected from an IoT environment installed in a room at KAIST, consisting of 6,843 events generated from 436 activities over a period from September 2015 to June 2016. The dataset was manually segmented for training and evaluation purposes.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring to highlight the lack of a formal citation for the dataset created by the authors. This will be important for anyone referencing this work in the future.
