To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention-augmented Spatio-Temporal Segmentation for Land Cover Mapping" by Rahul Ghosh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on two real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section V (Experimental Results)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **D1: Sentinel based crop mapping for Central Valley in California, USA**: This dataset consists of multi-spectral images from the Sentinel-2 Constellation for the year 2018, covering various crop types. The authors provide details about the data collection process, including the spatial resolution and the ground truth labels sourced from the Cropland Data Layer (CDL).

2. **D2: Planet based Cashew tree-crop mapping in Benin, Africa**: This dataset includes multi-spectral monthly composites from Planet Labs, focusing on cashew plantations. The authors describe the spatial resolution and the manual annotation process used to create the ground truth labels.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **D1 (Sentinel based crop mapping)**, the citation is:
  > Ghosh, R., Ravirathinam, P., Jia, X., Khandelwal, A., Mulla, D. J., & Kumar, V. (2021). Calcrop21: A georeferenced multi-spectral dataset of satellite imagery and crop labels. *CoRR*, abs/2107.12499.

- For **D2 (Planet based Cashew tree-crop mapping)**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset, it references the use of high-resolution Airbus imagery for ground truth annotation, which may not have a formal citation in the paper.

Now, I will summarize the datasets with their respective details and citations:

1. **Dataset Name**: Sentinel based crop mapping for Central Valley in California, USA
   - **Description**: Multi-spectral images from the Sentinel-2 Constellation for the year 2018, covering various crop types.
   - **Citation**: Ghosh, R., Ravirathinam, P., Jia, X., Khandelwal, A., Mulla, D. J., & Kumar, V. (2021). Calcrop21: A georeferenced multi-spectral dataset of satellite imagery and crop labels. *CoRR*, abs/2107.12499.

2. **Dataset Name**: Planet based Cashew tree-crop mapping in Benin, Africa
   - **Description**: Multi-spectral monthly composites from Planet Labs for mapping cashew plantations.
   - **Citation**: Not explicitly provided in the paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that the citations are complete and accurate for any future use or verification.
