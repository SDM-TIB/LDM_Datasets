To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combination of window-sliding and prediction range method based on LSTM model for predicting cryptocurrency" by Yifan Yao and Lina Wang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and data collection sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the study focuses on cryptocurrency price trends, specifically Bitcoin and Ethereum, which suggests that there are datasets related to these cryptocurrencies.

Next, I will look closely at the **data collection section**. Here, the authors state that the data for their analysis is collected from **CoinMarketCap**, an authoritative website for cryptocurrency market statistics. They specify that they are using data for Bitcoin and Ethereum, which includes daily open, high, low, close values, transaction volume, and market capitalization. This section provides a clear indication of the datasets used in the study.

I will also check the **results and conclusion sections** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets or provide additional context about the data used in their experiments. However, the primary dataset is already identified in the data collection section.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Bitcoin Dataset**: The dataset includes daily price data (open, high, low, close), transaction volume, and market capitalization, sourced from CoinMarketCap.
   - Citation: CoinMarketCap. "Bitcoin (BTC) Price, Chart, Market Cap, and Info." Available at: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/

2. **Ethereum Dataset**: Similar to Bitcoin, this dataset includes daily price data (open, high, low, close), transaction volume, and market capitalization, also sourced from CoinMarketCap.
   - Citation: CoinMarketCap. "Ethereum (ETH) Price, Chart, Market Cap, and Info." Available at: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
