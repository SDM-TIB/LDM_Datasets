To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Singing Voice Conversion" by Eliya Nachmani and Lior Wolf, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions a new method for singing voice conversion, but it does not specify any datasets. However, the introduction discusses the challenges of collecting training data and hints at the use of existing datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Smule DAMP Dataset**: The authors describe how they selected five singers from the DAMP dataset, which consists of multiple songs per singer. They provide a link to the dataset and mention the specific section used for their experiments.

2. **NUS-48E Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as containing 12 singers with four songs each, which were used for training their unsupervised method. The authors note that the audio quality in this dataset is significantly cleaner than in the DAMP dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Smule DAMP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. C. Smith, “Correlation analyses of encoded music performance,” Ph.D. dissertation, Stanford, CA, USA, 2013.

- For the **NUS-48E Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Z. Duan, H. Fang, B. Li, K. C. Sim, and Y. Wang, “The nus sung and spoken lyrics corpus: A quantitative comparison of singing and speech,” in 2013 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference. IEEE, 2013, pp. 1–9.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Smule DAMP Dataset**: This dataset includes multiple songs from various singers, specifically selected for the study. The authors used five singers, each with ten vocal songs, for their experiments.

2. **NUS-48E Dataset**: This dataset consists of 12 singers, each with four songs, and is noted for its higher audio quality compared to the DAMP dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
