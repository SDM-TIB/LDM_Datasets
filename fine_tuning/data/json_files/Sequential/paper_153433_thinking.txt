To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cascaded LSTMs based Deep Reinforcement Learning for Goal-driven Dialogue" by Yue Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the model and its performance but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and experiments sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional dialogue systems and the need for joint modeling of subtasks. However, they do not specify any datasets here.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the experimental setup. They mention using a user simulator to generate user utterances for training the dialogue agents. They also refer to the DSTC5 Corpus as a source of utterances to supplement their user simulators. This indicates that the DSTC5 Corpus is a dataset used in their experiments.

I will also look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors describe the construction of user simulators based on data collected from an online system, but they do not provide a specific name for this dataset. Therefore, I will focus on the DSTC5 Corpus as the primary dataset identified.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DSTC5 Corpus. The citation is as follows:
> DSTC5 Corpus. (2017). Retrieved from http://workshop.colips.org/dstc5/data.html

Since the authors do not provide a formal citation for the user simulator data, I will only include the DSTC5 Corpus in my dataset extraction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the DSTC5 Corpus. This will allow for proper referencing and acknowledgment of the dataset used in the research.
