To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ReLU and Addition-based Gated RNN" by Rickard Brännvall et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments on handwritten text recognition tasks, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for the experiments. In **subsection 4.4**, the authors mention the **MNIST dataset**, which is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition. They describe it as consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, widely used for benchmarking in machine learning.

In **subsection 4.5**, the authors refer to the **IAM Handwriting Database**, which is another dataset used for handwriting recognition. They provide a brief description of the dataset, noting that it contains handwritten words from over 700 writers and is commonly used in the field of Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

2. For the **IAM Handwriting Database**, the citation is:
   > Urs-Viktor Marti and H. Bunke. *The IAM Database: An English Sentence Database for Offline Handwriting Recognition*. International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition, 5:39–46, 2002. doi: 10.1007/s100320200071.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
