To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NMR Spectrum Reconstruction as a Pattern Recognition Problem" by Amir Jahangiri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a deep neural network (WNN) for reconstructing NMR spectra, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the training and testing of this model.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of NMR spectroscopy and the need for effective data reconstruction methods. They mention the use of synthetic data for training, which indicates that there is a dataset generated for this purpose.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.1 (Synthetic data for Training and Testing)**, where the authors describe the data model used for generating synthetic datasets. They explain how the free induction decay (FID) signals are modeled and how various parameters are varied to create a large dataset for training the WNN. This section provides critical details about the synthetic dataset used for training.

The authors also mention the generation of test datasets representing spectra for small, medium, and large proteins in **section 2.1.3 (Test data)**. They specify the number of spectra generated for each protein size, which is essential information for documenting the datasets.

Now, I will compile the relevant datasets and their citations. The datasets identified are:

1. **Synthetic Data for Training WNN**: This dataset is generated using a model based on the FID signal, which includes various parameters to simulate realistic NMR spectra. The authors do not provide a formal citation for this synthetic dataset, as it is generated by the authors themselves.

2. **Test Data for Small, Medium, and Large Proteins**: The authors generated synthetic datasets for testing the WNN, specifically for three protein sizes:
   - Small proteins: 1500 spectra with 1 to 10 peaks.
   - Medium proteins: 1500 spectra with 1 to 20 peaks.
   - Large proteins: 1500 spectra with 1 to 30 peaks.
   Again, these datasets are generated by the authors and do not have formal citations.

3. **NMR Spectra of Ubiquitin, Azurin, and MALT1**: The authors mention using previously described protein samples for their experiments. The citations for these proteins are:
   - Ubiquitin: 
     > P. S. Brzovic, A. Lissounov, D. E. Christensen, D. W. Hoyt, and R. E. Klevit. "A ubch5/ubiquitin non-covalent complex is required for processive brca1-directed ubiquitination." *Molecular Cell*, vol. 21, no. 6, pp. 873–880, 2006.
   - Azurin: 
     > D. M. Korzhnev, B. G. Karlsson, V. Y. Orekhov, and M. Billeter. "NMR detection of multiple transitions to low-populated states in azurin." *Protein Science*, vol. 12, no. 1, pp. 56–65, 2003.
   - MALT1: 
     > S. Unnerståle et al. "Backbone assignment of the malt1 paracaspase by solution nmr." *Plos One*, vol. 11, no. 1, p. e0146496, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that all relevant datasets are documented properly, including any necessary citations for the protein samples used in the experiments.
