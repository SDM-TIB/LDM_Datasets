To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Self2Self+: Single-Image Denoising with Self-Supervised Learning and Image Quality Assessment" by Jaekyun Ko and Sanghwan Lee, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiment sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art denoising performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for evaluation. In the text, they mention the following datasets:

1. **CBSD68**: This dataset is referenced in the context of evaluating the proposed method against various noise levels. It is noted that the dataset contains 68 images and is used for testing.

2. **SIDD Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as a high-quality denoising dataset for smartphone cameras, which includes pairs of noisy and corresponding reference images. They mention that the SIDD-Medium dataset encompasses 320 pairs of images.

3. **PolyU Dataset**: This dataset consists of 40 different static scenes captured by five cameras. The authors indicate that they cropped 100 regions from these scenes for training and testing purposes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CBSD68**, the citation is:
  > Martin, D.; Fowlkes, C.; Tal, D.; and Malik, J. (2001). *A Database of Human Segmented Natural Images and its Application to Evaluating Segmentation Algorithms and Measuring Ecological Statistics*. In Proc. 8th Int’l Conf. Computer Vision, volume 2, 416–423.

- For **SIDD Dataset**, the citation is:

- For **PolyU Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xu, J.; Li, H.; Liang, Z.; Zhang, D.; and Zhang, L. (2018). *Real-world Noisy Image Denoising: A New Benchmark*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.02603.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research in the field.
