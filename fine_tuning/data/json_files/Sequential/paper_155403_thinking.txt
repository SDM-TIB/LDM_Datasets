To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Grounding Hindsight Instructions in Multi-Goal Reinforcement Learning for Robotics" by Frank Röder et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions and may mention specific datasets used in the research. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the study, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. This section typically details the experimental setup and may describe the environments or datasets used for training and evaluation. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors may provide additional details about the datasets, such as their characteristics, size, and how they were utilized in the experiments. This is crucial for understanding the context in which the datasets were applied.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important because the datasets may have been introduced in other papers, and I need to provide the correct citations.

From my reading, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **LANRO Environment**: This is a novel class of environments for language-conditioned reinforcement learning with synthetic instructions and hindsight expert features. The paper describes it as a testbed for grounded language learning.

2. **BabyAI**: This platform is mentioned as an example of using language to describe goals in reinforcement learning. It provides integrated expert demonstrations and a synthetic subset of the English language.

3. **Panda-gym**: This is referenced as an open-source goal-conditioned environment for robotic learning, which inspired the authors' implementation.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets:

- For **LANRO Environment**, the citation is:
  > Röder, F., Eppe, M., & Wermter, S. (2022). Grounding Hindsight Instructions in Multi-Goal Reinforcement Learning for Robotics. In Proceedings of the 2022 IEEE International Conference on Development and Learning (ICDL).

- For **BabyAI**, the citation is:
  > Chevalier-Boisvert, M., Bahdanau, D., Lahlou, S., Willems, L., Saharia, T. H., Nguyen, T. H., & Bengio, Y. (2019). BabyAI: A Platform to Study the Sample Efficiency of Grounded Language Learning. In International Conference on Learning Representations.

- For **Panda-gym**, the citation is:
  > Gallouédec, Q., Cazin, N., Dellandréa, E., & Chen, L. (2021). Panda-gym: Open-Source Goal-Conditioned Environments for Robotic Learning. In Robot Learning Workshop: Self-Supervised and Lifelong Learning at NeurIPS.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the essence of each dataset and its citation for further processing or review.
