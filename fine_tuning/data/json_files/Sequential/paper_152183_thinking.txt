To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recurrent Batch Normalization" by Tim Cooijmans et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on various sequential problems, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors describe their evaluations. I will look for specific mentions of datasets used for training and testing their models.

In **subsection 5.1 (Sequential MNIST)**, the authors clearly state that they evaluate their model on the **MNIST** dataset, which is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit classification. They also mention a variant called **permuted MNIST (pMNIST)**, indicating that both datasets are used in their experiments.

In **subsection 5.2 (Character-Level Penn Treebank)**, the authors refer to the **Penn Treebank** corpus for character-level language modeling. This is another dataset that needs to be documented.

In **subsection 5.3 (Text8)**, the authors discuss the **text8 dataset**, which is derived from Wikipedia and consists of a sequence of characters. This dataset is also relevant for extraction.

In **subsection 5.4 (Teaching Machines to Read and Comprehend)**, the authors mention using the **CNN question-answering dataset** introduced by Hermann et al. (2015). This dataset is crucial for understanding the applicability of their model in natural language processing tasks.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **MNIST Dataset**:

   > Hermann, K. M., Kocisky, T., Grefenstette, E., Espeholt, L., Kay, W., Suleyman, M., & Blunsom, P. (2015). *Teaching machines to read and comprehend*. In NIPS.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
