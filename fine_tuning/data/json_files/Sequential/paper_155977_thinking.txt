To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Forecasting COVID-19 Case Counts Based on 2020 Ontario Data," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the project, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Data Understanding and Collection)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the research. Here, I will look for specific names of datasets, their descriptions, and the sources from which they were obtained.

In **subsection 4.2 (Sources of Data Used)**, the authors mention that they used COVID-19 case count data from Ontario, as well as weather and mobility data from various sources. I will note the specific datasets mentioned:

1. **COVID-19 Case Count Data**: This data was obtained from the Ontario government website (https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/confirmed-positive-cases-of-covid-19-in-ontario).
2. **Weather Data**: This was sourced from Environment and Climate Change Canada via the website (https://www.weatherstats.ca/).
3. **Mobility Data**: The mobility data was extracted from Facebook's "Movement Range Maps" dataset available at (https://data.humdata.org/dataset/movement-range-maps).

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **COVID-19 Case Count Data**, the citation is:
> Ontario Government. *Confirmed Positive Cases of COVID-19 in Ontario*. Retrieved from https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/confirmed-positive-cases-of-covid-19-in-ontario.

For the **Weather Data**, the citation is:
> Environment and Climate Change Canada. *Weather Data*. Retrieved from https://www.weatherstats.ca/.

For the **Mobility Data**, the citation is:
> Facebook. *Movement Range Maps*. Retrieved from https://data.humdata.org/dataset/movement-range-maps.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
