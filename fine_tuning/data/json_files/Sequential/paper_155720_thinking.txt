To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Baby Physical Safety Monitoring in Smart Home Using Action Recognition System" by Victor Adewopo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a benchmark dataset for a specific action recognition task related to baby monitoring. This suggests that there is a dataset that needs to be described.

Next, I will focus on the **dataset collection section (VI)**, where the authors detail how they curated their dataset. They mention that they created a unique dataset from scratch specifically for the Smart Baby Care action recognition task. They sourced videos from open platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and Pexels, which were then annotated frame-wise using the Labelbox tool. This section confirms the existence of a dataset, but I need to ensure I capture all relevant details.

The authors also mention that the dataset includes five different action classes of baby activities in the crib. However, they do not provide a formal name for this dataset, so I will refer to it as the "Smart Baby Room Dataset" for clarity in my extraction.

Now, I will check the **acknowledgment section** to see if there are any references to the dataset's availability or citation. The authors state that the dataset is available upon request for academic and educational purposes after approval from the funding organization, but they do not provide a formal citation for it.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets, I will focus on the Smart Baby Room Dataset. I will create a citation entry for it based on the information provided in the paper, even though it is not formally published. I will format it as follows:

- **Smart Baby Room Dataset**: Curated by Victor Adewopo et al. for the study on baby physical safety monitoring in smart homes. The dataset includes videos sourced from social media platforms and annotated for action recognition tasks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Smart Baby Room Dataset as described above. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
