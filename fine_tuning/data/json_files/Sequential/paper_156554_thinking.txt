To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting machine failures from multivariate time series: an industrial case study" by NicolÃ² Oreste Pinciroli Vago, Francesca Forbicini, and Piero Fraternali, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study evaluates three datasets related to industrial machines, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.1 (Data sets)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. The paper outlines three distinct datasets:

1. **Wrapping Machine Dataset**: This dataset contains telemetry data from an industrial wrapping machine, collected over one year. It includes various sensor measurements and alert codes indicating machine malfunctions.

2. **Blood Refrigerator Dataset**: This dataset consists of telemetry data from a blood refrigerator, including measurements of temperature and energy consumption, collected over a two-month period.

3. **Nitrogen Generator Dataset**: This dataset includes telemetry data from a nitrogen generator, with measurements of pressure and gas concentrations, collected over two months.

In the **methodology section**, the authors provide additional details about the data collection process, the types of variables measured, and the specific time frames for each dataset. This information is crucial for understanding the context and characteristics of each dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. However, the datasets themselves do not appear to have separate formal citations since they are original datasets created for this study. Instead, I will note the relevant details provided in the paper.

The citations for the datasets based on the descriptions in the paper are as follows:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will include its name, description, and citation as outlined above.
