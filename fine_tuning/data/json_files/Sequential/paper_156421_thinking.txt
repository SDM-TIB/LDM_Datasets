To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Survey of the Evolution of Language Model-Based Dialogue Systems" by Hongru Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on sections that are likely to contain specific dataset information.

Next, I will look for sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as **"Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology."** These sections often contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. I will pay attention to any tables or figures that may summarize dataset characteristics or provide comparisons.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics (e.g., size, number of samples, types of tasks). If the authors refer to datasets without providing full citations, I will check the **References section** to find the complete citations for each dataset.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like "MultiWOZ," I will look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Budzianowski, P., & Vandyke, D. (2018). *MultiWOZ - A large-scale multi-domain Wizard-of-Oz dataset for task-oriented dialogue modelling*. In EMNLP.

Once I have identified all datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.

Finally, I will double-check the accuracy of the citations and ensure that I have not missed any datasets mentioned in the paper. This thorough approach will help me create a comprehensive list of datasets used in the research, complete with full citations for each.
