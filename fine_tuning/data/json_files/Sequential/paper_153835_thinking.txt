To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pattern-based Long Short-term Memory for Mid-term Electrical Load Forecasting" by Paweł Pełka and Grzegorz Dudek, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may include references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their analysis. In this paper, the authors mention that they conducted a simulation study using the **monthly electricity demand time series for 35 European countries**. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, and I need to gather more details about it.

I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **simulation study section**. The authors state that the data is taken from the publicly available **ENTSO-E repository** and that it covers different periods for various countries. This is crucial information as it specifies the source and nature of the dataset.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the dataset:

1. **Monthly Electricity Demand Time Series for 35 European Countries**: This dataset includes time series data for electricity demand across 35 different European countries, with varying lengths and periods of data collection.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, since the dataset is sourced from the ENTSO-E repository, I will need to provide a citation for that repository instead of a traditional academic reference.

The citation for the dataset would be:
> ENTSO-E. *European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity*. Available at: www.entsoe.eu.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information and ensure that I have the full citation ready for inclusion in any structured output or documentation.

After completing these steps, I will have successfully extracted the relevant dataset information from the paper, including the necessary citation.
