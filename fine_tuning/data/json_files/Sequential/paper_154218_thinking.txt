To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Context Modeling in Neural Topic Segmentation" by Linzi Xing et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on three datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They categorize the datasets into two parts: those for intra-domain evaluation and those for domain transfer evaluation.

In **subsection 4.1 (Data for Intra-Domain Evaluation)**, the authors list three datasets:

1. **CHOI Dataset**: This dataset is synthesized from various sources and is known for its low quality. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Freddy Y. Y. Choi. *Advances in domain independent linear text segmentation*. In 1st Meeting of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2000.

2. **RULES Dataset**: Collected from the U.S. Federal Register, this dataset consists of documents that describe changes to regulations. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Marianne Bertrand et al. *Hall of mirrors: Corporate philanthropy and strategic advocacy*. Technical report, National Bureau of Economic Research, 2018.

3. **WIKI-SECTION Dataset**: This dataset is derived from Wikipedia articles and is noted for its reliability. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Sebastian Arnold et al. *Sector: A neural model for coherent topic segmentation and classification*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2019.

In **subsection 4.2 (Data for Domain Transfer Evaluation)**, the authors mention four additional datasets:

1. **WIKI-50 Dataset**: This dataset consists of samples from the English Wikipedia. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Omri Koshorek et al. *Text segmentation as a supervised learning task*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2018.

2. **Cities Dataset**: This dataset includes samples about cities. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Harr Chen et al. *Global models of document structure using latent permutations*. In Proceedings of Human Language Technologies, 2009.

3. **Elements Dataset**: This dataset consists of samples about chemical elements. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Harr Chen et al. *Global models of document structure using latent permutations*. In Proceedings of Human Language Technologies, 2009.

4. **Clinical Books Dataset**: This dataset includes chapters from a medical textbook. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Igor Malioutov and Regina Barzilay. *Minimum cut model for spoken lecture segmentation*. In Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Computational Linguistics, 2006.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included as specified. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
