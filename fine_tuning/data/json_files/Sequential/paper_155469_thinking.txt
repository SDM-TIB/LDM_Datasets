To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Univariate and Multivariate LSTM Model for Short-Term Stock Market Prediction" by Vishal Kuber et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used ten years of historical data from Yahoo Finance for two Indian companies, Reliance Industries and Infosys Ltd. This suggests that there is a dataset related to stock prices.

Next, I will look for specific details in the **methodology** and **experiments** sections. In the methodology, the authors describe the data collection process, stating that they obtained historical prices for Reliance and Infosys from Yahoo Finance, covering the period from 2012 to 2021. This confirms the existence of a dataset.

In the **research dataset** section, the authors provide a detailed description of the data, including daily OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) prices and volume for both stocks. They also include snippets of the data, which further supports the identification of the datasets.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets:

1. **Reliance Industries Dataset**: This dataset includes daily stock prices (Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close) and volume for Reliance Industries from January 2012 to December 2021. The data is sourced from Yahoo Finance.

2. **Infosys Ltd Dataset**: Similar to the Reliance dataset, this includes daily stock prices (Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close) and volume for Infosys Ltd for the same period, also sourced from Yahoo Finance.

Next, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets. Since the datasets are derived from Yahoo Finance, I will cite it as follows:

- For **Reliance Industries** and **Infosys Ltd**, the citation is:
  > Yahoo Finance. (2021). Historical Data for Reliance Industries and Infosys Ltd. Retrieved from https://finance.yahoo.com/

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its source. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
