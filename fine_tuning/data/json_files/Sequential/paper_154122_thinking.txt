To extract datasets from the research paper titled "YNU-HPCC at SemEval-2020 Task 11: LSTM Network for Detection of Propaganda Techniques in News Articles" by Jiaxu Dao, Jin Wang, and Xuejie Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the task and mentions the use of datasets for propaganda detection in news articles, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for the SemEval-2020 Task 11. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of:

1. **Training Set**: 371 news articles.
2. **Development Set**: 75 news articles.
3. **Test Set**: 90 news articles.

The authors also describe how the articles contain propaganda spans, which are marked with "begin offset" and "end offset." This detailed description confirms the presence of a structured dataset for the task.

I will then look for any references to the dataset's source or citation. In this case, the authors refer to the SemEval-2020 Task 11 organized by Giovanni Da San Martino et al. This indicates that the dataset is associated with the task and should be cited accordingly.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset based on the references section of the paper. The relevant citation for the dataset is:

- For the SemEval-2020 Task 11 dataset, the citation is:
  > Giovanni Da San Martino, Alberto Barrón-Cedeño, Henning Wachsmuth, Rostislav Petrov, and Preslav Nakov. *SemEval-2020 task 11: Detection of propaganda techniques in news articles*. In Proceedings of the 14th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, SemEval 2020, Barcelona, Spain, December.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and ensure that the full citation is included for proper referencing. This will allow for a clear understanding of the datasets used in the research and their origins.
