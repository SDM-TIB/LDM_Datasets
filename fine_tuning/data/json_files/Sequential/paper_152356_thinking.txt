To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bi-directional LSTM Recurrent Neural Network for Chinese Word Segmentation" by Yushi Yao and Zheng Huang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on both traditional and simplified Chinese datasets, which suggests that specific datasets are used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using benchmark datasets from Backoff 2005 for evaluating their model on Chinese word segmentation. This section is crucial as it likely contains the names and details of the datasets used.

In the experiments section, the authors specifically refer to the following datasets:

1. **PKU Dataset**: A dataset used for Chinese word segmentation, which is part of the SIGHAN benchmark.
2. **MSRA Dataset**: Another dataset utilized for the same purpose, also part of the SIGHAN benchmark.
3. **AS Dataset**: A dataset for traditional Chinese word segmentation.
4. **HKCityU Dataset**: Another dataset for traditional Chinese word segmentation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the SIGHAN Backoff 2005 datasets, which are commonly referenced in the literature. The citation for the SIGHAN datasets is:

- For the **SIGHAN Backoff 2005 datasets**, the citation is:
  > Xue, N. (2005). *Chinese Word Segmentation and Named Entity Recognition: A Pragmatic Approach*. In Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 1-8.

Since the authors mention using these datasets for their experiments, I will ensure to include this citation when describing the datasets.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
