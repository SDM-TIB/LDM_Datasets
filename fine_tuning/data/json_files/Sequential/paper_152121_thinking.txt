To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Learning of Disentangled Representations from Video" by Emily Denton and Vighnesh Birodkar, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their approach on a range of synthetic and real videos, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention using several datasets, including:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits, commonly used for training various image processing systems.
2. **NORB**: A dataset that consists of images of toys taken from different viewpoints, used for object recognition tasks.
3. **SUNCG**: A dataset that provides 3D scene models and is often used for tasks involving scene understanding.
4. **KTH Actions**: A dataset containing videos of people performing various actions, used for action recognition tasks.

I will confirm the details of each dataset mentioned in the experiments section to ensure I have accurate descriptions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 2010.

- For **NORB**, the citation is:
  > Y. LeCun, F. Huang, and L. Bottou. *Learning Methods for Generic Object Recognition with Invariance to Pose and Lighting*. In CVPR, 2004.

- For **SUNCG**, the citation is:
  > S. Song, F. Yu, A. Zeng, A. X. Chang, M. Savva, and T. Funkhouser. *Semantic Scene Completion from a Single Depth Image*. IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2017.

- For **KTH Actions**, the citation is:
  > C. Schuldt, I. Laptev, and B. Caputo. *Recognizing Human Actions: A Local SVM Approach*. In Pattern Recognition, 2004.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
