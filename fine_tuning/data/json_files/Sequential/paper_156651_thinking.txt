To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Feature importance to explain multimodal prediction models. A clinical use case" by Jorn-Jan van de Beld et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions developing a multimodal deep-learning model using various data types, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Materials and Methods)**, where the authors describe their dataset in detail. They mention a **private dataset** containing anonymized data from **1669 patients** who underwent hip fracture surgery. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used.

In this section, the authors provide specifics about the dataset, including:
- The patient demographics (age, gender).
- The types of data collected: pre-operative static patient data, hip and chest images, vital signs, and medication data.

The paper states that the dataset is not publicly available due to privacy and ethical considerations, but it is crucial to document the dataset's characteristics and the context in which it was used.

Now, I will look for any references to other datasets in the **related work section** or **discussion section**. However, the primary dataset mentioned appears to be the one collected from the hospital.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the dataset or methodologies used for data collection. Since the dataset is private, there may not be a formal citation, but I will note the authors' methodology for future reference.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Jorn-Jan van de Beld, Shreyasi Pathak, Jeroen Geerdink, Johannes H. Hegeman, and Christin Seifert. *Feature importance to explain multimodal prediction models. A clinical use case*. 

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the citation for the paper as it is essential for proper attribution.

In summary, the key steps I will take are:
1. Identify the main dataset described in the paper.
2. Document the characteristics of the dataset.
3. Note the citation for the paper for future reference.
