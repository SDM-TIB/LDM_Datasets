To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast ASR-free and almost zero-resource keyword spotting using DTW and CNNs for humanitarian monitoring" by Raghav Menon et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a small set of recorded keywords and a larger untranscribed dataset for their experiments, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention the **South African Broadcast News (SABN) corpus**, which consists of 23 hours of speech from news bulletins broadcast between 1996 and 2006. This dataset is crucial for evaluating the performance of their keyword spotting system.

In this section, the authors provide details about the SABN corpus, including its composition and the division into training, development, and test sets. They also mention the number of utterances and the total speech hours, which are important for understanding the dataset's scale.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SABN corpus. The citation provided in the paper is:

> H. Kamper, F. D. Wet, T. Hain, and T. Niesler. "Capitalising on North American speech resources for the development of a South African English large vocabulary speech recognition system." *Computer Speech and Language*, vol. 28, no. 6, pp. 1255â€“1268, 2014.

Since the authors also mention using a small set of isolated keywords recorded specifically for their study, I will note that this dataset consists of 1920 labeled isolated keywords, but it does not have a formal citation as it was created for this research.

In summary, I will compile the dataset entries as follows:

1. **South African Broadcast News (SABN) corpus**: This dataset consists of 23 hours of speech from news bulletins, with a total of 13,445 utterances divided into training, development, and test sets.

2. **Isolated Keywords Dataset**: This dataset includes 1920 labeled isolated keywords recorded by 24 speakers, but it does not have a formal citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that the full citation for the SABN corpus is included for proper referencing.
