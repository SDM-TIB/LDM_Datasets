To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ShrinkML: End-to-End ASR Model Compression Using Reinforcement Learning" by Łukasz Dudziak et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors present accuracy results on **LibriSpeech**, which suggests that this dataset is used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology and experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the use of an end-to-end ASR model that has achieved state-of-the-art results on **LibriSpeech**. This indicates that **LibriSpeech** is a key dataset for their work.

In section 4.3 (On-Device Measurements and Considerations), the authors mention that they evaluate their models on the **LibriSpeech test datasets** (test-clean and test-other). This confirms that **LibriSpeech** is indeed the dataset they are using for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **LibriSpeech dataset**. The relevant citation is:

- For **LibriSpeech**:
  > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *LibriSpeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In ICASSP, 2015, pp. 5206–5210.

Since **LibriSpeech** is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for **LibriSpeech** to ensure it is ready for review or further processing.
