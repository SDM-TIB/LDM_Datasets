To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PAT: Parallel Attention Transformer for Visual Question Answering in Vietnamese" by Nghia Hieu Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of the **ViVQA dataset**, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved. The introduction further elaborates on the significance of multimodal learning and mentions various tasks, but I need to focus on the specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experimental results section** (Section IV) where the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on the **ViVQA dataset**. This section will provide details about the dataset's characteristics and its relevance to the study.

In the **related works section**, the authors reference other datasets such as **VQAv1** and **VQAv2**, which are significant benchmarks in the field of Visual Question Answering. I will note these datasets as they are relevant to the context of the research.

Now, I will gather detailed information about each dataset mentioned:

1. **ViVQA Dataset**: This is the primary dataset used in the experiments. The authors state that it is the first visual question answering dataset for Vietnamese. I will look for any specific details about the number of images, questions, or any unique characteristics that define this dataset.

2. **VQAv1 Dataset**: This dataset is introduced by Antol et al. and is widely recognized in the VQA community. I will ensure to capture its details, including the number of images and questions.

3. **VQAv2 Dataset**: This dataset is an extension of VQAv1, aimed at addressing some of its limitations. I will extract its details similarly.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **ViVQA dataset**, the citation is:
  > K. Q. Tran, A. T. Nguyen, A. T.-H. Le, and K. V. Nguyen. *ViVQA: Vietnamese Visual Question Answering*. In Proceedings of the 35th Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation, pages 546–554, Shanghai, China, 11 2021. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **VQAv1 dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Antol, A. Agrawal, J. Lu, M. Mitchell, D. Batra, C. L. Zitnick, and D. Parikh. *VQA: Visual Question Answering*. In International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015.

- For the **VQAv2 dataset**, the citation is:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for structured output or further processing.
