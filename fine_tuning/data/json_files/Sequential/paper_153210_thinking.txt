To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating Contextualized Embeddings on 54 Languages in POS Tagging, Lemmatization and Dependency Parsing" by Milan Straka et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated methods on **89 corpora in 54 languages of the Universal Dependencies 2.3**, which suggests that these corpora are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the evaluation of contextualized word embeddings across various tasks. They mention the Universal Dependencies (UD) project, which is crucial for understanding the datasets used.

In the **methods section**, I will look for specific mentions of datasets. The authors refer to **Universal Dependencies 2.3**, which consists of 129 treebanks in 76 languages, with 89 treebanks containing training sets that are freely available. This indicates that the datasets are part of the Universal Dependencies project.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any specific details about the datasets used in their experiments. They mention the performance on various UD treebanks, confirming that these are the datasets utilized for their evaluations.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The key dataset is the **Universal Dependencies 2.3**, which is cited as follows:

- For **Universal Dependencies 2.3**, the citation is:
  > Joakim Nivre et al. 2018. *Universal Dependencies 2.3*. LINDAT/CLARIN digital library at the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics (UFAL), Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University.

Since the paper does not mention any other specific datasets apart from the Universal Dependencies, I will focus on this citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that the citation is complete and accurate for future reference.
