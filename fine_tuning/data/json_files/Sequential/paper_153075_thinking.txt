To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Hierarchical Attention Based Seq2seq Model for Chinese Lyrics Generation" by Haoshen Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that a "large Chinese lyrics corpus" was used for model training, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Data Processing)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that they collected **100,000 pop song lyrics** in monolingual Chinese, which is a significant dataset for their research. They also provide information about the preprocessing steps taken, such as filtering low-frequency words and splitting the data into training and test sets.

Now, I will look for the full citation of this dataset. Since the dataset is a collection of pop song lyrics, I will check the references section to see if there is a specific citation for the dataset or if it is a commonly known dataset in the field. However, it appears that the dataset is not attributed to a specific paper or source, which is often the case with proprietary or self-collected datasets.

Given that the dataset is a collection of lyrics, I will note it as follows:

- **Chinese Lyrics Corpus**: A dataset consisting of 100,000 pop song lyrics in monolingual Chinese, used for training the hierarchical attention-based Seq2Seq model.

Since there is no formal citation provided for this dataset in the references, I will document it as an internal dataset used by the authors without a specific citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly indicate the dataset name, description, and any relevant details, even if a formal citation is not available. This will help in maintaining clarity and completeness in the dataset extraction process.
