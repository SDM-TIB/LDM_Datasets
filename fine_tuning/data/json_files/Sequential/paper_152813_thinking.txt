To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention-driven Tree-structured Convolutional LSTM for High Dimensional Data Understanding" by B. Kong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method is validated on **four large-scale coronary artery datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In **subsection 5.2.1 (Dataset and Evaluation Metrics)**, they mention that four 3D cardiac CTA datasets (CA1, CA2, CA3, and CA4) were collected from four hospitals. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their evaluation.

I will then look for a **summary table (Table 2)** that lists the datasets, which provides additional details such as the number of training and testing examples. The datasets are summarized as follows:

- **CA1**: 516 examples, 438 training, 78 testing
- **CA2**: 546 examples, 464 training, 82 testing
- **CA3**: 446 examples, 380 training, 66 testing
- **CA4**: 324 examples, 276 training, 48 testing

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely proprietary or unpublished datasets collected from hospitals. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are referred to as CA1, CA2, CA3, and CA4 without specific citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the names and descriptions of the datasets, even if full citations are not available. The datasets will be described as follows:

1. **CA1**: A 3D cardiac CTA dataset collected from a hospital, containing 516 examples.
2. **CA2**: A 3D cardiac CTA dataset collected from a hospital, containing 546 examples.
3. **CA3**: A 3D cardiac CTA dataset collected from a hospital, containing 446 examples.
4. **CA4**: A 3D cardiac CTA dataset collected from a hospital, containing 324 examples.

Since the datasets are not publicly cited, I will indicate that they are proprietary datasets used for the purpose of this research.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
