To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pseudo Random Number Generation through Reinforcement Learning and Recurrent Neural Networks" by Luca Pasqualini and Maurizio Parton, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of a statistical test suite to evaluate the quality of pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs), which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the evaluation process.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors reference the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) statistical test suite for random and pseudo-random number generators, which indicates that this suite may be a dataset used for testing the PRNGs.

In the **methodology section**, I will pay close attention to any details about the data used for training or testing the models. The authors mention using the NIST statistical test suite to validate the PRNGs, which implies that the results from this suite are based on datasets of generated sequences.

I will also check the **results section** to see if there are any specific datasets mentioned in the context of the experiments conducted. The authors discuss the performance of their models based on the NIST scores, but they do not explicitly mention any additional datasets.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the NIST statistical test suite, as it is the primary dataset referenced throughout the paper. The citation for the NIST test suite is:

- Lawrence E Bassham III et al. "SP 800-22 Rev. 1A. A Statistical Test Suite for Random and Pseudorandom Number Generators for Cryptographic Applications." National Institute of Standards and Technology, 2010.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the NIST statistical test suite as the primary dataset referenced in the paper. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
