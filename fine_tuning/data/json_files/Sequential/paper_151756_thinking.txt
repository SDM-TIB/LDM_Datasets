To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tracking State Changes in Procedural Text: A Challenge Dataset and Models for Process Paragraph Comprehension" by Bhavana Dalvi Mishra et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract states that the authors present a new dataset called **ProPara**, which contains natural text about processes along with annotations of entity states. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the dataset. Here, the authors mention that ProPara is the first dataset of its kind, containing 488 human-authored paragraphs and 81,000 annotations about changing states. This reinforces the importance of the ProPara dataset.

I will then look into **section 3 (The ProPara Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. They explain that ProPara focuses on procedural text and includes 488 paragraphs about 183 processes, with a grid representation of entity states. This section confirms the dataset's structure and purpose.

In addition, I will check the **experiments** section to see if any other datasets are mentioned. The authors reference the **bAbI dataset** and the **SCoNE dataset** as comparisons, but they do not use these datasets in their experiments. Instead, they focus on ProPara.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations I need to extract are:

1. For **ProPara**, the citation is:
   > Bhavana Dalvi Mishra, Lifu Huang, Niket Tandon, Wen-tau Yih, and Peter Clark. *Tracking State Changes in Procedural Text: A Challenge Dataset and Models for Process Paragraph Comprehension*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2020.

2. For **bAbI dataset**, the citation is:
   > Jason Weston, Sumit Chopra, and Antoine Bordes. *Memory Networks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1410.3916, 2014.

3. For **SCoNE dataset**, the citation is:
   > Reginald Long, Panupong Pasupat, and Percy Liang. *Simpler context-dependent logical forms via model projections*. In ACL, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. The focus will be on ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.
