To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Speech Recognition with Augmented Synthesized Speech" by Andrew Rosenberg et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method using two corpora from different domains, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention using **LIBRISPEECH** and **ISOLATED-SENTENCES** as the two corpora for their experiments. This is a clear indication that these are the datasets I need to document.

In the **methodology section**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of both datasets:

1. **LIBRISPEECH**: This is a 960-hour corpus of books read by non-professional speakers, divided into a 460-hour "clean" portion and a 500-hour "other" partition. The clean portion consists of speakers whose speech is easier to recognize, while the other portion includes more difficult speakers.

2. **ISOLATED-SENTENCES**: This is an internal corpus containing 76 hours of material across 201,000 utterances collected from 1,988 speakers. The authors note that the number of speakers is similar to LIBRISPEECH, but the total material is significantly less.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **LIBRISPEECH**, the citation is:
  > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *Librispeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206â€“5210, 2015.

- For **ISOLATED-SENTENCES**, since it is an internal corpus, it may not have a formal citation like LIBRISPEECH. However, I will note that it is described in the paper as an internal dataset.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for LIBRISPEECH and a note for ISOLATED-SENTENCES, ready for structured output or further processing.
