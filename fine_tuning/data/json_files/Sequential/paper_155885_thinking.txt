To extract datasets from the research paper titled "StockEmotions: Discover Investor Emotions for Financial Sentiment Analysis and Multivariate Time Series" by Jean Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions the introduction of **StockEmotions**, a dataset for detecting emotions in the stock market, which indicates that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any relevant subsections that provide detailed information about the datasets. In this paper, the **StockEmotions Dataset** is described in detail, including its size, the source of the data (comments from StockTwits), and the emotional classes it includes.

I will note the key details about the **StockEmotions Dataset**:
- It consists of **10,000 English comments** collected from StockTwits.
- The dataset includes **2 financial sentiment classes** (bullish and bearish) and **12 emotion classes**.
- The time period for the data collection is from **January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020**.

After identifying the dataset, I will check the **References section** for the full citation of the dataset. The paper does not provide a separate citation for the StockEmotions dataset itself, but it does reference the source of the comments (StockTwits) and the methodology used for data collection and annotation.

Since the dataset is newly introduced in this paper, I will create a citation for it based on the authors and the title of the paper. The citation will be formatted as follows:

> Jean Lee, Hoyoul Luis Youn, Josiah Poon, and Soyeon Caren Han. *StockEmotions: Discover Investor Emotions for Financial Sentiment Analysis and Multivariate Time Series*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2023.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and the full citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset extracted from the paper.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and ready for further processing or review.
