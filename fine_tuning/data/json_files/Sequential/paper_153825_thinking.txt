To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ParkPredict: Motion and Intent Prediction of Vehicles in Parking Lots" by Xu Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors collected a dataset of human parking maneuvers using the CARLA simulator, which suggests that there is a specific dataset to extract.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the dataset. The introduction discusses the challenges of predicting driver behavior in parking lots and mentions the development of a dataset, but does not provide specific names or details.

I will then focus on **section II (Experimental Design and Dataset)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the dataset. In this section, the authors describe the dataset generated from human driving demonstrations, including the number of demonstrations (600 total), the types of maneuvers (forward and reverse parking), and the features collected (e.g., trajectories, final parked spot location, and signaled intent). This section confirms the existence of a dataset and provides some context about its contents.

The authors also mention that the dataset consists of 20,850 instances, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's scale. They provide a link to access the processed dataset, which is important for citation purposes.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the CARLA simulator, as it is integral to the dataset's generation. The relevant citation is:

- For the CARLA simulator:
  > A. Dosovitskiy, G. Ros, F. Codevilla, A. Lopez, and V. Koltun. *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning, 2017, pp. 1â€“16.

Since the dataset is based on the CARLA simulator, I will also note that the dataset itself does not have a separate citation in the references, but it is derived from the work using the CARLA simulator.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset's name, description, and the full citation for the CARLA simulator as the source of the dataset.

In summary, the key steps I will take are:
1. Read the abstract for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Review the introduction for context and details.
3. Focus on the experimental design section for specific dataset information.
4. Retrieve the full citation for the CARLA simulator from the references.
5. Compile the dataset information with proper citations.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper.
