To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Respiratory motion forecasting with online learning of recurrent neural networks for safety enhancement in externally guided radiotherapy" by Michel Pohl et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to previous works that may have used specific datasets or any datasets that the authors plan to use in their research. This section often contains background information that can hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsection titled "Marker position data." Here, the authors describe the data they collected, which includes nine time-series records of 3D trajectories of external markers on the chest of subjects. This section is crucial as it provides specific details about the dataset, including the number of records, the duration of each sequence, and the method of data acquisition.

The authors mention that the data was acquired via an infrared stereo camera (NDI Polaris) and that the sequences last from 73s to 320s. They also specify that five records correspond to regular breathing, while four records involve activities like speaking or laughing. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's context and variability.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to include the original sources.

For the dataset extracted, I will note the following:

1. **Dataset Name**: External Marker Position Data
   - **Description**: Nine time-series records of 3D trajectories of external markers on the chest of healthy subjects, acquired via an infrared stereo camera (NDI Polaris).
   - **Details**: Each sequence lasts from 73s to 320s, with five records for regular breathing and four for activities like speaking or laughing.
   - **Citation**: The original source for the NDI Polaris camera data acquisition method should be referenced if available.

2. **Additional Datasets**: If any other datasets are mentioned in the paper, I will follow the same process to extract their details and citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that all citations are complete and accurate.
