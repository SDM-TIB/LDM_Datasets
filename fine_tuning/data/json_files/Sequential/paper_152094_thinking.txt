To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recurrent neural networks with specialized word embeddings for health-domain named-entity recognition" by Inigo Jauregi Unanue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their system over three contemporary datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Results)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **i2b2/VA Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating Clinical Concept Extraction (CCE). The authors note that it is a reduced set of the original 2010 i2b2/VA dataset, which is no longer distributed due to restrictions.

2. **DDI-DrugBank Dataset**: This dataset is part of the SemEval-2013 Task 9.1 for Drug Name Recognition (DNR). The authors provide statistics about the dataset, indicating its relevance for their experiments.

3. **DDI-MedLine Dataset**: Similar to the DrugBank dataset, this is also part of the SemEval-2013 Task 9.1 for DNR. The authors include statistics and details about this dataset as well.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **i2b2/VA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Uzuner, Ö., South, B. R., Shen, S., & DuVall, S. L. (2011). 2010 i2b2/va challenge on concepts, assertions, and relations in clinical text. *Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association*, 18(5), 552-556.

- For the **DDI-DrugBank Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Herrero-Zazo, M., Segura-Bedmar, I., Martínez, P., & Declercq, T. (2013). The ddi corpus: An annotated corpus with pharmacological substances and drug–drug interactions. *Journal of Biomedical Informatics*, 46(5), 914-920.

- For the **DDI-MedLine Dataset**, the citation is the same as for the DrugBank dataset since both datasets are part of the same SemEval challenge.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
