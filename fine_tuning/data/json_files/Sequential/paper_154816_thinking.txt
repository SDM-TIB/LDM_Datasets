To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ctrl-P: Temporal Control of Prosodic Variation for Speech Synthesis" by Devang S Ram Mohan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the model's ability to generate speech conditioned on acoustic features, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction also focuses on the model's capabilities without naming specific datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experimental setup)**, as this section typically contains details about the datasets used in experiments. Here, the authors mention that they used a **proprietary, multi-speaker, Mexican-Spanish corpus** consisting of approximately 38 hours of speech. This is the primary dataset referenced in the experiments.

Since the dataset is proprietary, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. However, I will still note it as it is crucial for understanding the context of the research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to datasets. In this case, the authors do not provide a formal citation for the proprietary dataset, which is common for internal datasets. However, I will ensure to document the dataset's description accurately.

Finally, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset:

1. **Proprietary Multi-Speaker Mexican-Spanish Corpus**: This dataset consists of approximately 38 hours of speech and is used for training the proposed model. Since it is proprietary, there is no formal citation available.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I clearly indicate the nature of the dataset and its significance in the research. This will be ready for any structured output or further processing as needed.
