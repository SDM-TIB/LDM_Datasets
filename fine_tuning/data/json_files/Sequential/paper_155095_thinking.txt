To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An actor-critic algorithm with deep double recurrent agents to solve the job shop scheduling problem" by Marta Monaci et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a deep reinforcement learning methodology for the job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) and indicates that benchmarks were generated for comparison with a commercial solver. This suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training and testing the proposed algorithm. In this section, the authors describe the training set composed of randomly generated JSSP instances with various sizes, which is a clear indication of a dataset.

I will note the details provided in **Table 1**, which summarizes the training set:
- The training set consists of randomly generated JSSP instances with five classes of problems, ranging from (8 × 6) to (20 × 15), with a total of 1000 instances (200 per class). The processing times are drawn from a Gaussian distribution \(N(\mu = 100, \sigma = 10)\).

Next, I will check the **test sets** mentioned in **Table 2**. The authors describe two test sets:
1. **Gaussian test set**: Similar to the training set, with classes ranging from (30 × 25) to (50 × 45), with 100 instances per class, and processing times drawn from a Gaussian distribution \(N(\mu = 100, \sigma = 10)\).
2. **Poisson test set**: Also with classes from (30 × 25) to (50 × 45), with 100 instances per class, but the processing times are drawn from a Poisson distribution \(P(\lambda = 100)\).

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets. Since the datasets are generated by the authors, I will cite the paper itself as the source for these datasets:

- For the **training set**:
  > Monaci, M., Agasucci, V., & Grani, G. (2021). An actor-critic algorithm with deep double recurrent agents to solve the job shop scheduling problem. *Preprint submitted to Elsevier*. 

- For the **Gaussian test set**:
  > Monaci, M., Agasucci, V., & Grani, G. (2021). An actor-critic algorithm with deep double recurrent agents to solve the job shop scheduling problem. *Preprint submitted to Elsevier*.

- For the **Poisson test set**:
  > Monaci, M., Agasucci, V., & Grani, G. (2021). An actor-critic algorithm with deep double recurrent agents to solve the job shop scheduling problem. *Preprint submitted to Elsevier*.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the relevant details and citations for each dataset. This will provide a clear and organized representation of the datasets used in the research.
