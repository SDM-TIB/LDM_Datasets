To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RoBERTa-BiLSTM: A Context-Aware Hybrid Model for Sentiment Analysis" by Md. Mostafizer Rahman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using datasets from **IMDb, Twitter US Airline, and Sentiment140**, which suggests these are the primary datasets used in their research.

Next, I will focus on **section V (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **IMDb Dataset**: This dataset consists of 50,000 reviews, evenly split between positive and negative sentiments, making it a balanced dataset.

2. **Twitter US Airline Dataset**: This dataset contains 14,640 tweets categorized into three sentiment classes: positive, neutral, and negative. The authors note an imbalance in the distribution of sentiments.

3. **Sentiment140 Dataset**: This dataset comprises approximately 1.6 million tweets, with an equal distribution of positive and negative sentiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **IMDb Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Maas, A., Daly, R. E., Pham, P. T., Huang, D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2011). Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (pp. 142â€“150).

- For the **Twitter US Airline Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Go, A., Bhayani, R., & Huang, L. (2009). Twitter sentiment classification using distant supervision. CS224N project report, Stanford.

- For the **Sentiment140 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Go, A., Bhayani, R., & Huang, L. (2009). Twitter sentiment classification using distant supervision. CS224N project report, Stanford.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
