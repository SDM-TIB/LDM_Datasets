To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Strict baselines for Covid-19 forecasting and ML perspective for USA and Russia" by Alexander G. Sboev et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of datasets accumulated over two years for predictive analysis of Covid-19, which indicates that datasets are indeed present. The introduction elaborates on the sources of data, specifically mentioning organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU), which suggests these may be key datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **Data** section (section 2), as it is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors specify that they used historical data on confirmed daily cases published by JHU and Yandex.DataLens. They also mention the time frame of the data, which is from March 12, 2020, to February 15, 2022, and that the data includes information from individual regions in the USA and Russia.

I will note the two main datasets mentioned:

1. **Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Covid-19 Dataset**: This dataset contains historical information on daily confirmed, death, and recovery cases of Covid-19. It is a widely recognized dataset used in many Covid-19 studies.

2. **Yandex.DataLens Covid-19 Dataset**: This dataset provides similar information for Russia, including detailed data on individual regions.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the JHU dataset as follows:

- For the **JHU Covid-19 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ensheng Dong, Hongru Du, and Lauren Gardner. *An interactive web-based dashboard to track covid-19 in real time*. The Lancet Infectious Diseases, 20(5):533â€“534, 2020.

The Yandex.DataLens dataset does not have a specific citation in the references, but I will note that it is mentioned as a public dashboard for Covid-19 data.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets I have identified. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
