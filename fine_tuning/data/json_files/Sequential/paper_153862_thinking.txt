To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Generalization Effects of Linear Transformations in Data Augmentation" by Sen Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention validating their theoretical insights on **MNIST** and propose an augmentation scheme that outperforms RandAugment on **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, **SVHN**, and **ImageNet**. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** section, particularly in **section 5** where they describe their experimental setup. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit classification, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
2. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
3. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images.
4. **SVHN**: A dataset of color images of house numbers, containing 73,257 training images and 26,032 testing images.
5. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with over 1.3 million training images across 1,000 classes.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be documented with its name, description, and full citation to ensure clarity and completeness.
