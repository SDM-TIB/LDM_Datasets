To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Abstractive Information Extraction from Scanned Invoices (AIESI) using End-to-end Sequential Approach" by Shreeshiv Patel and Dvijesh Bhatt, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of extracting key parameters from scanned documents, but they do not mention specific datasets yet. I will need to look further into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **method section**, particularly the **experiment and result section**. Here, the authors mention that their architecture for Key Information Extraction (KIE) has been validated on the **ICDAR 2019 robust reading challenge dataset**. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed model.

The authors provide details about the **SROIE dataset**, which is part of the ICDAR 2019 challenge. They specify that this dataset contains 1000 scanned receipts, with 876 for training and 347 for validation/testing. Each invoice is annotated with parameters such as company name, address, date, and total.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

1. For the **ICDAR 2019 robust reading challenge dataset**, the citation is:
   > Zheng Huang, Kai Chen, Jianhua He, Xiang Bai, Dimosthenis Karatzas, Shijian Lu, and CV Jawahar. *ICDAR2019 competition on scanned receipt OCR and information extraction*. In 2019 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), pages 1516â€“1520. IEEE, 2019.

2. For the **SROIE dataset**, which is part of the ICDAR dataset, the citation is included in the above reference since it is a specific subset used in the challenge.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
