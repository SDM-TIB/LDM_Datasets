        "dcterms:description": "GERMS is a medium size dataset with approximately 120K images of 136 different objects collected by a robot. The robot examines each object by rotating them in front of the camera at 10 different orientations, aiming to recognize the object for 4 test orientations, given the other 6 in-hand orientations. It is a challenging dataset as it requires the extraction of small visual cues and fine categorization.",
