To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LCSCNet: Linear Compressing Based Skip-Connecting Network for Image Super-Resolution" by Wenming Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference datasets that are commonly used in the field of image super-resolution. 

In the **experiments section**, I will look for specific mentions of datasets used for training and testing the proposed models. The authors typically describe the datasets in detail, including their characteristics and the number of images or samples they contain.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention two datasets:

1. **DIV2K Dataset**: This dataset is highlighted as a widely-used benchmark for image super-resolution tasks, consisting of 800 high-resolution images. It is often used for training and evaluating super-resolution models.

2. **291 Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as another benchmark used in the experiments, which contains 291 images specifically curated for super-resolution tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I find are:

- For the **DIV2K Dataset**:
  > Agustsson, E., & Timofte, R. (2017). NTIRE 2017 challenge on single image super-resolution: Dataset and study. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (pp. 126–135).

- For the **291 Dataset**:
  > Yang, C.-Y., Ma, C., & Yang, M.-H. (2014). Single-image super-resolution: A benchmark. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (pp. 372–386).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work.
