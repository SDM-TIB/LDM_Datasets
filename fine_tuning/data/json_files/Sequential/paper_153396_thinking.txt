To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Byte-Pair Encoding for Text-to-SQL Generation" by Samuel Müller and Andreas Vlachos, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract references the "Advising dataset" and indicates that it is used for text-to-SQL tasks. This is a strong indication that I should look for more details about this dataset.

Next, I will examine **section 7 (Results)**, where the authors discuss their evaluation on various datasets. They mention three datasets: 

1. **Advising Dataset**: This dataset contains 4,570 questions and is used for evaluating the text-to-SQL generation methods.
2. **ATIS Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as containing questions related to air travel, and it is noted that it has been republished by Finegan-Dollak et al. (2018).
3. **GeoQuery Dataset**: This dataset consists of 877 questions about the geography of the United States and is also mentioned as being republished by Finegan-Dollak et al. (2018).

In the **References section**, I will look for the full citations for these datasets. The citations I need to extract are:

- For the **Advising Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Finegan-Dollak, C., Kummerfeld, J. K., Zhang, L., Ramanathan, K., Sadasivam, S., Zhang, R., & Radev, D. (2018). Improving text-to-sql evaluation methodology. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 351–360.

- For the **ATIS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dahl, D. B., Fisher, W. M., Hunicke-Smith, K., & Shriber, E. (1994). Expanding the scope of the ATIS task: The ATIS-3 corpus. Proceedings of the workshop on Human Language Technology, pages 43–48.

- For the **GeoQuery Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zelle, J. M., & Mooney, R. J. (1996). Learning to parse database queries using inductive logic programming. In Proceedings of the Thirteenth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence - Volume 2, pages 1050–1055.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references for future use.
