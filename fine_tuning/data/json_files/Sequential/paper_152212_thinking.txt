To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust LSTM-Autoencoders for Face De-Occlusion in the Wild" by Fang Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets of faces with occlusion, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In this paper, they describe two main datasets:

1. **CASIA-WebFace Dataset**: This dataset is used for training the model. It contains 10,575 subjects and 494,414 face images collected from the web. The authors synthesized occlusions using various templates from this dataset.

2. **LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) Dataset**: This dataset is used for testing the model. It contains 13,233 face images of 5,749 subjects, collected from the web, and is noted to have no overlap with the CASIA-WebFace dataset.

Additionally, the authors mention a third dataset:

3. **50OccPeople Dataset**: This is a custom dataset created by the authors, containing 50 subjects and 1,200 images, each with one normal face image and 23 images taken under realistic illumination conditions with various types of occlusions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **CASIA-WebFace Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yi, D., Lei, Z., Liao, S., & Li, S. (2014). Learning face representation from scratch. CoRR, abs/1411.7923.

- For the **LFW Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Huang, G., Ramesh, M., Berg, T., & Learned-Miller, E. (2007). Labeled faces in the wild: A database for studying face recognition in unconstrained environments. University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Tech. Rep. 07-49.

- For the **50OccPeople Dataset**, since it is a custom dataset created by the authors, it may not have a formal citation. However, I will note it as a dataset created specifically for this research.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately represented the datasets used in the research paper. This will allow for proper referencing and understanding of the datasets involved in the study.
