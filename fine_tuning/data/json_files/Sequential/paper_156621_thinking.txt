To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Neural Networks to Model Hysteretic Kinematics in Tendon-Actuated Continuum Robots" by Yuan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the modeling of hysteretic behavior in tendon-actuated continuum robots, which suggests that experimental data may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental section (Section III)**, where the authors describe their experiments in detail. Here, they mention collecting training data using sinusoidal functions to capture hysteresis. Specifically, they refer to three types of baseline conditions for the tendon displacements, which indicates that datasets were generated under different experimental setups.

In **Section III-A (Training Data)**, the authors describe how they collected kinematic data by sampling input-output paths or trajectories in configuration and task space. They mention using decaying sinusoids with different mean offsets to generate the training datasets. This section provides critical information about the nature of the datasets.

The authors also specify that they collected data at multiple frequencies (0.1 Hz to 0.5 Hz) and used different baseline conditions (0 BL, Mid BL, End BL) for their experiments. This indicates that there are multiple datasets generated from these experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or methodologies referenced in the paper. The authors cite various works that may provide context or additional datasets relevant to their study.

1. **Training dataset for tendon displacement**: The authors mention using decaying sinusoids to generate training data. However, they do not provide a specific dataset citation for this method, as it appears to be a novel approach developed for their experiments.

2. **Reference for sinusoidal function modeling**: The authors refer to a previous work that discusses the use of sinusoidal functions for modeling hysteresis. This reference is crucial for understanding the methodology behind their dataset generation.

3. **General references for continuum robots**: The paper cites several foundational works on continuum robots and their modeling, which may not be datasets per se but are essential for understanding the context of the research.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include full citations where applicable. The key datasets identified are:

- **Tendon Displacement Dataset**: Generated using decaying sinusoids with varying parameters across different baseline conditions and frequencies.

- **Reference for sinusoidal modeling**: This will be cited to provide context for the dataset generation method.

Finally, I will ensure that all citations are formatted correctly and ready for inclusion in the final output.
