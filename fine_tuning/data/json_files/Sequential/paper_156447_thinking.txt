To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LSTM Network Analysis of Vehicle-Type Fatalities on Great Britain's Roads" by Salter Heï¿¿ron-Smith et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study utilizes an extensive dataset from the Department for Transport (DfT) covering reported collisions, casualties, and vehicle involvements from 1926 to 2022. This suggests that there are multiple datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically the **Data Acquisition** subsection, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. They mention three primary categories of datasets:

1. **Collisions Dataset**: This dataset includes detailed records of reported road traffic collisions, with key columns such as year, fatality counts, and collision severity metrics.

2. **Casualties Dataset**: This dataset provides information on casualties involved in road traffic accidents, including fatalities among different types of road users (e.g., pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists).

3. **Vehicles Dataset**: This dataset details the types of vehicles involved in accidents, including counts for various vehicle categories like cars, buses, and motorcycles.

In the **Understanding the Datasets** subsection, the authors elaborate on the structure and significance of each dataset, which confirms their relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that the datasets are sourced from the Department for Transport (DfT), but I need to ensure I have the correct citation format for each dataset.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Collisions Dataset**: 
  > Department for Transport. *Reported Road Casualties in Great Britain: 2019 Annual Report*. 2020.

- **Casualties Dataset**: 
  > Department for Transport. *Reported Road Casualties in Great Britain: 2019 Annual Report*. 2020.

- **Vehicles Dataset**: 
  > Department for Transport. *Reported Road Casualties in Great Britain: 2019 Annual Report*. 2020.

Since all datasets are derived from the same source, I will use the same citation for each dataset entry.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
