To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning for real-time neural decoding of grasp" by Paolo Viviani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the work is based on a specific pre-existing dataset of neural recordings from monkey motor cortex, which suggests that there is a dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset structure)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the dataset used in the study. Here, the authors describe the dataset acquired from the Deutsches Primatenzentrum (DPZ), which includes neural signals recorded from two macaque monkeys during grasping tasks. They mention that the dataset consists of six recording sessions, each with specific identifiers (e.g., MRec40, MRec41, ZRec32, etc.).

In this section, I will note the following details about the dataset:

1. **Dataset Name**: The dataset is referred to as the neural recordings dataset from the motor cortex of two Non-Human Primates (NHP).
2. **Description**: The dataset includes multi-channel spike trains segmented into trials corresponding to instances of grasp/release processes.
3. **Recording Sessions**: The dataset consists of six recording sessions with identifiers:
   - MRec40
   - MRec41
   - MRec42
   - ZRec32
   - ZRec35
   - ZRec50

I will also look for any specific details about the dataset's structure, such as the number of channels and trials, which are provided in Table 1 of the paper.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the original dataset acquisition and processing methods, which are crucial for proper citation. 

The relevant citation for the dataset is:
> Schaffelhofer, S., Agudelo-Toro, A., & Scherberger, H. (2015). *Decoding a Wide Range of Hand Configurations from Macaque Motor, Premotor, and Parietal Cortices*. Journal of Neuroscience, 35(3), 1068-1081.

Now, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are accurately captured and formatted correctly.
