To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid Pointer Networks for Traveling Salesman Problems Optimization" by Ahmed Stohy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a novel hybrid network applied to combinatorial optimization problems, specifically the traveling salesman problem (TSP). However, it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where datasets are typically discussed. In the experiments section, the authors mention that they generated training data randomly from a uniform distribution. This indicates that they created their own dataset for the experiments rather than using a pre-existing one.

I will also look for any references to benchmark datasets in the **benchmark instances results and statistical analysis** section. Here, the authors mention using varied-size examples from the public libraries **TSPLIB** and **World TSP**. This is crucial as it indicates that these are the datasets used for validation against their model.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section:

1. **TSPLIB**: This is a well-known library of benchmark instances for the traveling salesman problem and related problems. The citation for TSPLIB is:
   > Applegate, D.L., B. B. et al. *The Traveling Salesman Problem*. Princeton University Press, 2011.

2. **World TSP**: This dataset consists of various instances of the traveling salesman problem from different geographical locations. The citation for the World TSP is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is often associated with the same authors as TSPLIB. I will note that it is commonly referenced in the literature.

After identifying these datasets, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations for future reference or processing.
