To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MeetSum: Transforming Meeting Transcript Summarization using Transformers!" by Nima Sadri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a Transformer-based Pointer Generator Network for summarizing meeting transcripts and indicates that the authors utilized specific datasets for training and testing their model.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the part labeled **3.3 datasets**. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets they used:

1. **AMI Meeting Corpus**: This dataset is described as containing 142 transcripts of meetings, each with 4 to 5 attendants, and their corresponding abstract summaries. The authors provide details about the dataset's structure, including the division into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **CNN-DailyMail**: This dataset is noted to contain over 300,000 news articles from CNN and Dailymail, each accompanied by a human-written summary. The authors mention that this dataset is used solely for training their model.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **AMI Meeting Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Mccowan, I.; Lathoud, G.; Lincoln, M.; Lisowska, A.; Post, W.; Reidsma, D.; and Wellner, P. (2005). *The AMI Meeting Corpus*. In Proceedings of Measuring Behavior 2005, 5th International Conference on Methods and Techniques in Behavioral Research. Wageningen: Noldus Information Technology.

- For the **CNN-DailyMail dataset**, the citation is:
  > See, A.; Liu, P. J.; and Manning, C. D. (2017). *Get to the point: Summarization with pointer-generator networks*. CoRR abs/1704.04368.

Now that I have the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details for future reference or processing.
