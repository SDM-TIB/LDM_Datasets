To extract datasets from the research paper titled "StackSeq2Seq: Dual Encoder Seq2Seq Recurrent Networks" by Alessandro Bay and Biswa Sengupta, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods** sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the shortest path problem and mention various algorithms but do not specify any datasets. Moving on to the **methods section**, specifically **section 2.1 (Datasets)**, I find that the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that the graph is based on the road network of Minnesota, which consists of 376 nodes and 455 edges. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as being derived from a specific source, which is a URL to a package related to the graph. However, it is important to note that this URL does not constitute a formal citation in the traditional sense. Therefore, I will treat it as a dataset reference.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:
- **Minnesota Road Network**: A graph dataset representing the road network of Minnesota, consisting of 376 nodes and 455 edges. The coordinates of the nodes are constrained to specific longitude and latitude ranges.

Since the dataset is derived from a specific source, I will include the URL as part of the citation:
> Minnesota Road Network. Available at: https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgleich/packages/matlab_bgl

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the necessary details, ensuring that the full citation is included as required.

After completing this process, I will have a structured entry for the dataset that can be used for further analysis or processing.
