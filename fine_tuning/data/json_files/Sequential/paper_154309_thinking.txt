To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Keyphrase Extraction with Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks and Diversified Inference" by Haoyu Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that "Extensive experiments on various KE benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach," which indicates that multiple datasets are used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiment)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention five scientific article datasets:

1. **Kp20k**: This dataset is referenced as being used for training and contains a large number of samples.
2. **Inspec**: Another dataset mentioned, which is commonly used for keyphrase extraction tasks.
3. **Krapivin**: This dataset is also noted for its relevance in keyphrase extraction.
4. **NUS**: This dataset is included in the experiments and is known for its application in scientific publications.
5. **SemEval**: This dataset is part of the evaluation process for keyphrase extraction.

The paper provides a table (Table 1) that includes statistics about these datasets, such as the number of samples and the average length of keyphrases, which further confirms their usage.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets mentioned are as follows:

- For **Kp20k**, the citation is:
  > Meng, R., Yuan, X., Wang, T., Brusilovsky, P., Trischler, A., & He, D. (2017). *Deep Keyphrase Generation*. In ACL (1), 582–592. The Association for Computer Linguistics.

- For **Inspec**, the citation is:
  > Hulth, A. (2003). *Improved Automatic Keyword Extraction Given More Linguistic Knowledge*. In EMNLP. The Association for Computer Linguistics.

- For **Krapivin**, the citation is:
  > Krapivin, M., Autaeu, A., & Marchese, M. (2009). *Large dataset for keyphrases extraction*. Technical report, University of Trento.

- For **NUS**, the citation is:
  > Nguyen, T. D., & Kan, M. (2007). *Keyphrase Extraction in Scientific Publications*. In ICADL, volume 4822, 317–326. Springer.

- For **SemEval**, the citation is:
  > Kim, S. N., Medelyan, O., Kan, M., & Baldwin, T. (2010). *SemEval-2010 Task 5: Automatic Keyphrase Extraction from Scientific Articles*. In SemEval@ACL, 21–26. The Association for Computer Linguistics.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research paper along with their proper references.
