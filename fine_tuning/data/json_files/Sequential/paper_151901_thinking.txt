To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention-Based Models for Text-Dependent Speaker Verification" by F A Rezaur Rahman Chowdhury et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any explicit mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I need to dive deeper into the body of the paper for specific dataset details.

In **section 4.1 (Datasets and basic setup)**, the authors describe their training and testing datasets. They mention that the training dataset consists of a collection of anonymized user voice queries, specifically a mixture of “OK Google” and “Hey Google” phrases. This dataset contains around **150 million utterances from approximately 630,000 speakers**. The testing dataset is also described, consisting of **665 speakers** divided into two enrollment sets and two verification sets for each phrase, with an average of **4.5 enrollment utterances and 10 evaluation utterances per speaker**.

Next, I will ensure that I capture the full citations for any datasets referenced. However, in this case, the datasets are not associated with formal citations like traditional datasets; instead, they are described in terms of their composition and usage in the experiments.

Since the datasets are not formally published datasets with specific citations, I will note them as follows:

1. **Training Dataset**: A collection of anonymized user voice queries, consisting of approximately 150 million utterances from around 630,000 speakers, focusing on the phrases “OK Google” and “Hey Google”.

2. **Testing Dataset**: A manual collection of 665 speakers, divided into two enrollment sets and two verification sets for each phrase, with an average of 4.5 enrollment utterances and 10 evaluation utterances per speaker.

Now, I will summarize the findings and prepare to document the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I clearly indicate the nature of the datasets and their relevance to the research without formal citations, as they are not traditional datasets with published references.

After compiling this information, I will be ready to present the dataset entries in a structured manner for further processing or review.
