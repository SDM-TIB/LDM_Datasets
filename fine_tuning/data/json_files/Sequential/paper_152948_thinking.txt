To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Adversarial Learning Framework For A Persona-Based Multi-Turn Dialogue Model" by Oluwatobi Olabiyi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors experimented with two conversational datasets: the **Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus (UDC)** and transcripts from the **Big Bang Theory** and **Friends**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that provide more details about these datasets. In the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1**, the authors describe the datasets in detail:

1. **Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus (UDC)**: This dataset consists of 1.85 million conversations from the Ubuntu community hub, with an average of 5 utterances per conversation. The authors mention that they assign speaker IDs to utterances and provide a training, development, and test split of 90%, 5%, and 5%, respectively.

2. **TV Series Transcripts dataset**: This dataset is constructed from transcripts of the **Big Bang Theory** and **Friends**. The authors collected utterances from the top 12 speakers, resulting in a corpus of 5,008 lines of multi-turn dialogue. They also mention a similar training, development, and test split of 94%, 3%, and 3%, respectively.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus (UDC)**, the citation is:
  > I. V. Serban, A. Sordoni, R. Lowe, L. Charlin, J. Pineau, A. Courville, and Y. Bengio. *A hierarchical latent variable encoder-decoder model for generating dialogue*. In Proceedings of The Thirty-first AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2017).

- For the **TV Series Transcripts dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. E. Banchs. *Movie-dic: A movie dialogue corpus for research and development*. In Proceedings of the 50th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 203â€“207, 2012.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets and their citations clearly. I will ensure that each dataset is accurately described and that the citations are complete and formatted correctly for inclusion in any further documentation or analysis.
