To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FashionNTM: Multi-turn Fashion Image Retrieval via Cascaded Memory" by Anwesan Pal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on the **Multi-turn FashionIQ** dataset and a multi-turn version of the **Shoes** dataset. This suggests that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **Multi-turn FashionIQ**: This dataset is noted as the only existing multi-turn fashion dataset, derived from the original single-turn FashionIQ dataset. It contains 11,505 sessions across three clothing types and is split into transactions of 2-turns, 3-turns, and 4-turns.

2. **Multi-turn Shoes**: This dataset is an extension of the original Shoes dataset, which includes images of women’s shoes along with natural language descriptions. The authors created a multi-turn version of this dataset to facilitate research in multi-turn image retrieval.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Multi-turn FashionIQ**, the citation is:
  > Yifei Yuan and Wai Lam. *Conversational fashion image retrieval via multiturn natural language feedback*. In Proceedings of the 44th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pages 839–848, 2021.

- For **Shoes dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tamara L Berg, Alexander C Berg, and Jonathan Shih. *Automatic attribute discovery and characterization from noisy web data*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 663–676. Springer, 2010.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
