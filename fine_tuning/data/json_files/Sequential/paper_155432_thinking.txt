To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Taygete at SemEval-2022 Task 4: RoBERTa based models for detecting Patronising and Condescending Language" by Jayant Chhillar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the work involves detecting patronising and condescending language, which suggests that a dataset is likely used for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Background)** and **section 2.1 (Dataset)**, where the author explicitly mentions the dataset used for training the models. Here, I find that the dataset referred to is "The Don’t Patronize Me!" dataset, which is described in detail. The section outlines the dataset's characteristics, including the number of samples, the classification of samples, and the categories of patronising and condescending language.

The dataset is described as containing 10,469 samples, with 993 classified as positive samples containing PCL, and it categorizes PCL into seven different sub-categories. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The citation for "The Don’t Patronize Me!" dataset is:
> Carla Pérez-Almendros, Luis Espinosa-Anke, and Steven Schockaert. *Don’t patronize me! An annotated dataset with patronizing and condescending language towards vulnerable communities*. In Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, pages 5891–5902, 2020.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
