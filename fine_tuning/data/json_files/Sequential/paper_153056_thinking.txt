To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Structured Representation and Data: A Hybrid Model for Negation and Sentiment in Customer Service Conversations" by Amita Misra et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the exploration of negation in customer service interactions, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to customer service tweets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Conversational Negation Corpus)**, where the authors describe the dataset they created. They mention that they collected **89,552 customer service tweets** from various companies, which were then filtered to create a dataset of **2,000 annotated tweets** for negation analysis. This section provides specific details about the dataset, including the number of tweets and the annotation process.

In **section 5 (Sentiment with Negation Detection)**, the authors discuss the sentiment annotation task, which involved **17,779 tweets** after filtering. This indicates that there is another dataset related to sentiment analysis based on the customer service tweets.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The citations are as follows:

1. **Conversational Negation Corpus**:
   > Misra, A., Bhuiyan, M., Mahmud, J., & Tripathy, S. (2023). Using Structured Representation and Data: A Hybrid Model for Negation and Sentiment in Customer Service Conversations. *Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)*.

2. **Sentiment Annotated Dataset**:

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
