To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequence Learning Using Equilibrium Propagation" by Malyaban Bal and Abhronil Sengupta, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to two specific tasks: **sentiment analysis** and **natural language inference**, which suggests that datasets related to these tasks are likely discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, the authors explicitly mention the datasets for their experiments:

1. **IMDB Dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis and consists of 50,000 reviews, with 25,000 for training and 25,000 for testing. The authors reference the dataset as follows:
   > Maas, A., Daly, R. E., Pham, P. T., Huang, D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2011). Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (pp. 142-150).

2. **SNLI Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for natural language inference tasks and comprises 570,000 pairs of premises and hypotheses. The citation provided in the paper is:
   > Bowman, S. R., Angeli, G., Potts, C., & Manning, C. D. (2015). A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference. arXiv preprint arXiv:1508.05326.

After identifying these datasets, I will verify their usage in the **experiments section** to confirm that they were indeed employed in the authors' evaluations. The authors clearly state that they used the IMDB dataset for sentiment analysis and the SNLI dataset for natural language inference, which aligns with the earlier findings.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their full citations to ensure that all necessary details are captured accurately. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **IMDB Dataset**: 
   - Citation: Maas, A., Daly, R. E., Pham, P. T., Huang, D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2011). Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (pp. 142-150).

2. **SNLI Dataset**: 
   - Citation: Bowman, S. R., Angeli, G., Potts, C., & Manning, C. D. (2015). A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference. arXiv preprint arXiv:1508.05326.

With this structured approach, I can ensure that I have accurately extracted and cited the datasets used in the research paper.
