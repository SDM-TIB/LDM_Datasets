To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RTMobile: Beyond Real-Time Mobile Acceleration of RNNs for Speech Recognition" by Peiyan Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a speech recognition dataset, which suggests that a specific dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** where the authors discuss their evaluation setup. Here, they mention using the **TIMIT dataset** for their experiments. I will look for a detailed description of this dataset, including its characteristics and relevance to the study.

In the **evaluation results and discussion section**, the authors provide context for the TIMIT dataset, stating that it contains broadband recordings from 630 speakers reading ten phonetically rich sentences in eight major dialects of American English. This description confirms the dataset's applicability for automatic speech recognition tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the TIMIT dataset. The citation is as follows:
> J. S. Garofolo, L. F. Lamel, W. M. Fisher, J. G. Fiscus, D. S. Pallett, N. L. Dahlgren, and V. Zue. *TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus*. Linguistic Data Consortium, vol. 10, no. 5, p. 0, 1993.

Since the TIMIT dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation is included.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the TIMIT dataset, ready for any further processing or review.
