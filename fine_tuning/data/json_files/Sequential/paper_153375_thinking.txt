To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Kernel-Based Approaches for Sequence Modeling: Connections to Neural Methods" by Kevin J. Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions experiments on "natural language processing tasks" and "analysis of local field potentials," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention several datasets used for document classification and language modeling tasks. Specifically, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets and their characteristics.

In **Table 2**, the authors list the datasets used for document classification, which include:

1. **AGNews**: A topic classification dataset.
2. **Yahoo!**: Another topic classification dataset.
3. **Yelp Full**: A sentiment analysis dataset.
4. **DBpedia**: An ontology classification dataset.

In **Table 3**, they mention datasets for language modeling, specifically:

1. **Penn Tree Bank (PTB)**: A well-known dataset for language modeling.
2. **Wikitext-2**: Another dataset used for language modeling tasks.

Additionally, in **Table 4**, they discuss a dataset related to Local Field Potential (LFP) classification, which includes recordings from mice.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **AGNews**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, Y., & Wallace, B. (2015). A Sensitivity Analysis of (and Practitionersâ€™ Guide to) Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification. *Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR)*.

- For **Yahoo!**, the citation is:

- For **DBpedia**, the citation is:

  > Marcus, M. P., Santorini, B., & Marcinkiewicz, M. A. (1993). Building a Large Annotated Corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*.

- For **Wikitext-2**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
