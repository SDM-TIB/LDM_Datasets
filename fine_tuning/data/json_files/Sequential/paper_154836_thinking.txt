To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatio-Temporal SAR-Optical Data Fusion for Cloud Removal via a Deep Hierarchical Model" by Alessandro Sebastianelli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors have generated a dataset for their cloud removal method, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Dataset and Related Aspects)**, where the authors describe the dataset they created. They mention that the dataset contains corresponding Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) images, which are randomly distributed across the Earth’s surface. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's structure, including the number of images, regions of interest (ROIs), and the temporal aspect of the data.

The authors state that the dataset consists of:
- **17000 SAR images** (from Sentinel-1)
- **17000 Optical images** (from Sentinel-2)
- The images are organized into **141 different ROIs**, with each ROI containing a time-series of four images acquired at one-month intervals.

Additionally, they mention that the dataset is publicly available and provide a link to the GitHub repository where it can be accessed. This is important for citation purposes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference their dataset as follows:
> Sebastianelli, A., Puglisi, E., Del Rosso, M. P., Mifdal, J., Nowakowski, A., Pirri, F., Mathieu, P. P., & Ullo, S. L. (2022). *Spatio-Temporal SAR-Optical Data Fusion for Cloud Removal Git-Hub repository*. Retrieved from https://github.com/Sebbyraft/Spatio-Temporal-SAR-Optical-Data-Fusion-for-Cloud-Removal.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset details and prepare to format them according to the required structure.

1. **Dataset Name**: SAR-Optical Dataset

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry into the specified format for further processing or review. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant details and citations for the dataset mentioned in the research paper.
