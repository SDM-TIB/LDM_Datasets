To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Rule Extraction from Long Short Term Memory Networks" by W. James Murdoch and Arthur Szlam, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors apply their method to sentiment analysis and question answering datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In **Section 5.2 (Sentiment Analysis)**, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Yelp Review Polarity Dataset**: This dataset is used for binary classification of reviews as positive or negative. The authors note that it was obtained from the Yelp Dataset Challenge, with training and testing sets of sizes 560,000 and 38,000, respectively.

2. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis at the sentence level, with training, development, and test sizes of 6920, 872, and 1821, respectively.

In **Section 5.3 (WikiMovies)**, the authors introduce the **WikiMovies dataset**, which consists of over 100,000 questions about movies paired with relevant Wikipedia articles. This dataset is constructed using the MovieLens dataset and templates from the SimpleQuestions dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Yelp Review Polarity Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, and Yann LeCun. *Character-level convolutional networks for text classification*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 649â€“657, 2015.

- For the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Y Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D Manning, Andrew Y Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In EMNLP, 2013.

- For the **WikiMovies dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alexander Miller, Adam Fisch, Jesse Dodge, Amir-Hossein Karimi, Antoine Bordes, and Jason Weston. *Key-value memory networks for directly reading documents*. In Empirical Methods for Natural Language Processing, 2016.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets mentioned in the paper.
