To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An EnKF-LSTM Assimilation Algorithm for Crop Growth Model" by Siqi Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions that the proposed method was validated using datasets collected by sensor equipment deployed on a farm, which indicates that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** to find detailed descriptions of the datasets. In this section, the authors describe the data collected from a farm in Heilongjiang province, China, which includes environmental data such as carbon dioxide index, soil temperature, soil moisture, and relative humidity, as well as crop growth data, specifically the leaf area index (LAI). This suggests that there are at least two types of datasets: environmental data and crop growth data.

I will also check the **experimental design section** for more specifics about the datasets. Here, the authors mention that the data was collected from April 2022 to September 2022, and they describe the features included in the dataset, such as concentrations of CO2, soil temperature at various depths, and LAI measurements collected at intervals.

Now, I will look for the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or models mentioned. The paper references the WOFOST model, which is a simulation model for crop growth, and it is important to cite this model as it is integral to the methodology.

The relevant datasets and their citations are as follows:

1. **Environmental Data**: This dataset includes various environmental variables collected from sensor devices deployed on the farm. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset as it is original data collected by the authors.

2. **Crop Growth Data (LAI)**: The leaf area index (LAI) data was manually collected at 2â€“7-day intervals. Similar to the environmental data, this is also original data collected by the authors and does not have a specific citation.

3. **WOFOST Model**: The citation for the WOFOST model, which is used for crop growth simulation, is:
   > H.L. Boogaard, C.A. Van Diepen, R.P. Rotter, J.M.C.A. Cabrera, H.H. Van Laar. *User's guide for the WOFOST 7.1 crop growth simulation model and WOFOST control center 1.5*. Technical Document 52. Winand Staring Centre, Wageningen, the Netherlands, 1998.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that all datasets are properly documented and cited, which is crucial for academic integrity and reproducibility.
