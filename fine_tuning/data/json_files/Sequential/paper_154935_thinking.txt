To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Class dependency based learning using Bi-LSTM coupled with the transfer learning of VGG16 for the diagnosis of Tuberculosis from chest x-rays" by G. Jignesh Chowdary et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their model using data from two publicly available databases: the **Montgomery County set** and the **Schezien set**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Results and discussion)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. They mention three datasets:

1. **JSRT Dataset**: This dataset is used for training the lung segmentation model. It contains 247 chest x-rays, with 154 being abnormal and 93 normal. The dataset is sourced from 14 medical centers.

2. **Shenzhen Dataset**: This dataset is developed by Shenzhen hospital and contains 662 chest x-rays, with 336 showing TB infection and 326 normal. It was collected in September 2012.

3. **Montgomery County Dataset**: This dataset consists of 138 chest x-rays, with 58 containing TB manifestations and 80 normal. It was collected during a tuberculosis control program in Montgomery County, Maryland.

In the **References section**, I will find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing.
