To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Language learning using Speech to Image retrieval" by Danny Merkx, Stefan L. Frank, and Mirjam Ernestus, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses improvements in image-caption retrieval performance, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the need for models to learn language from raw sensory input, hinting at the use of datasets that contain both speech and visual data. I will look for specific dataset names or references.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Image to spoken-caption retrieval)**, where the authors explicitly mention the **Flickr8k database**. This section provides details about the dataset, stating that it contains 8,000 images with five English captions per image, and that spoken captions were collected using Amazon Mechanical Turk workers.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Flickr8k dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **Flickr8k database**:
  > M. Hodosh, P. Young, and J. Hockenmaier. "Framing image description as a ranking task: Data, models and evaluation metrics." *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, vol. 47, no. 1, pp. 853â€“899, 2013.

Additionally, I will note that the authors mention using two types of acoustic features: **Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)** and **Multilingual Bottleneck (MBN)** features. However, these are not datasets but rather feature extraction methods used on the audio data.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the **Flickr8k database** using the required citation format.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is structured correctly and ready for any further processing or review.
