To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Gender by First Name Using Character-level Machine Learning" by Rosana C. B. Rego, VerÃ´nica M. L. Silva, and Victor M. Fernandes, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that a dataset of Brazilian names is used for training and evaluation, which suggests that there is a specific dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Dataset and Pre-Processing)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They mention that the dataset consists of **100,787 Brazilian names**, with a gender distribution of **54.82% female and 45.18% male**, based on the 2010 CENSO data from the Brasil.io project. This section also describes the attributes included in the dataset, such as gender information, name, total frequency, group frequency, group name, and ratio.

The authors also mention that they prepared two subsets of the data: one with names that have a **100% gender ratio** (consisting of **90,158 names**) and another with all names regardless of gender ratio. This indicates that there are at least two distinct datasets being referenced.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset used. The authors reference the Brasil.io project, which is the source of the dataset. The citation for the dataset is:

> Brasil.io. *Dataset of Brazilian Names*. Available at: https://brasil.io/dataset/genero-nomes/grupos/

With this information, I can summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Brazilian Names Dataset**: Contains 100,787 names with gender labels, derived from the 2010 CENSO data.
2. **Subset with 100% Gender Ratio**: A filtered dataset consisting of 90,158 names where each name has a definitive gender classification.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as specified. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the relevant datasets and their sources from the paper.
