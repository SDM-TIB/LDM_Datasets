To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bivariate Beta-LSTM" by Kyungwoo Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for testing their models. This section is crucial as it usually contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, I will specifically look for any references to datasets used for tasks such as sentence classification, image caption generation, or polyphonic music modeling, as these are mentioned in the abstract and introduction.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions the **CR (Customer Reviews) dataset**, I will look for its citation in the references. If it is not explicitly cited, I will search for the original source of the dataset online to ensure I have the correct citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is accurate and complete.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, making sure to include all relevant details for each dataset extracted from the paper.
