To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stock Portfolio Optimization Using a Deep Learning LSTM Model" by Jaydip Sen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions analyzing historical prices of stocks from various sectors, which indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Data Acquisition and Methodology)**, where the authors describe the data collection process. They state that they extracted historical prices of the top five stocks from nine different sectors of the Indian stock market from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2020. This section is crucial as it provides specific details about the datasets.

The paper mentions using data from the **Yahoo Finance** website, which is a significant source for stock price data. I will note that the dataset consists of historical stock prices for 45 stocks across nine sectors.

Now, I will identify the specific sectors and their corresponding stocks as mentioned in the paper:

1. **Pharmaceuticals**: 
   - Stocks: Sun Pharmaceuticals (SNP), Dr. Reddy's Lab (DRL), Divi's Lab (DVL), Cipla (CPL), Lupin (LUP).

2. **Infrastructure**: 
   - Stocks: Reliance Industries (RIL), Larsen & Toubro (LNT), Bharti Airtel (BAT), Ultra Tech Cement (UTC), Power Grid Corporation (PGC).

3. **Realty**: 
   - Stocks: DLF (DLF), Godrej Properties (GPR), Oberoi Realty (OBR), Phoenix Mills (PHM), Prestige Estates Projects (PRE).

4. **Media**: 
   - Stocks: Zee Entertainment (ZEE), PVR (PVR), Sun TV Network (STN), TV18 Broadcast (TVB), Dish TV India (DTI).

5. **Public Sector Banks**: 
   - Stocks: State Bank of India (SBI), Bank of Baroda (BOB), Punjab National Bank (PNB), Canara Bank (CNB), Bank of India (BOI).

6. **Private Sector Banks**: 
   - Stocks: HDFC Bank (HDB), ICICI Bank (ICB), Axis Bank (AXB), Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB), IndusInd Bank (IIB).

7. **Large-Cap**: 
   - Stocks: Reliance Industries (RIL), HDFC Bank (HDB), Infosys (IFY), Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDF), ICICI Bank (ICB).

8. **Mid-Cap**: 
   - Stocks: Shriram Transport Finance Company (STF), Voltas (VLT), Cholamandalam Investment and Finance (CIF), AU Small Finance Bank (ASF), Max Financial Services (MFS).

9. **Small-Cap**: 
   - Stocks: Central Depository Services (CDS), Kajaria Ceramics (KJC), APL Apollo Tubes (AAT), Multi Commodity Exchange (MCE), IDFC (IDF).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets. The paper cites the **NSE Website** as the source for the stock data, which is crucial for proper citation.

The full citation for the dataset source is:
> NSE Website: http://www1.nseindia.com.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the source of the stock data. Each dataset will be described with its respective stocks and the time period covered.

Finally, I will prepare the structured output for the datasets, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and future reference.
