To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IIIDYT at IEST 2018: Implicit Emotion Classification With Deep Contextualized Word Representations" by Jorge A. Balazs, Edison Marrese-Taylor, and Yutaka Matsuo, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in the WASSA 2018 Implicit Emotion Shared Task (IEST), which suggests that there is a dataset associated with this task.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any specific mentions of datasets. The authors reference the IEST task and describe its objectives, but I need to look for explicit dataset names or descriptions.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for details about the data used for training and testing their model. The authors mention that their system was evaluated on the dataset provided for the WASSA 2018 IEST, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for their work.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to the dataset. The authors cite Klinger et al. (2018) regarding the IEST task, which likely contains the necessary details about the dataset used.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

1. **WASSA 2018 Implicit Emotion Shared Task Dataset**: This dataset is used for the task of predicting emotions from tweets, where specific trigger words are removed. The dataset includes various tweets with emotional content, specifically targeting emotions like sadness, joy, disgust, surprise, anger, and fear.

Next, I will find the full citation for the dataset:

- For the **WASSA 2018 IEST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Klinger, R., de Clercq, O., Mohammad, S. M., & Balahur, A. (2018). IEST: WASSA-2018 Implicit Emotions Shared Task. In Proceedings of the 9th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis, Brussels, Belgium. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries according to the required format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented for any future use or reference.
