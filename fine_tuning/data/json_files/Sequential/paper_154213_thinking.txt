To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ELMo and BERT in semantic change detection for Russian" by Julia Rodina et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that might be mentioned. The abstract indicates that the evaluation test sets consist of Russian nouns and adjectives annotated based on their occurrences in texts from different historical periods. This suggests that there are specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss their methodology and the datasets used for evaluation. They mention using human-annotated datasets for evaluating semantic change detection methods, which is a strong indication that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

I will then look at **section 3 (Data)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets. In this section, the authors specify that they used two human-annotated datasets for evaluation, which are part of a larger dataset called **RuSemShift**. They describe two specific subsets of this dataset:

1. **RuSemShift1**: This dataset covers the semantic changes from the pre-Soviet to the Soviet period and contains 48 words annotated by independent annotators.
2. **RuSemShift2**: This dataset covers the semantic changes from the Soviet to the post-Soviet period and contains 51 words annotated similarly.

The authors provide details about how the words were annotated and the methodology used for evaluation, confirming that these datasets are integral to their research.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that RuSemShift is part of a larger project, and I will need to ensure I have the correct citation for it. The citation for the RuSemShift dataset is:

- For **RuSemShift**:
  > Rodina, J., Trofimova, Y., Kutuzov, A., & Artemova, E. (2020). *RuSemShift: A dataset for diachronic semantic change detection in Russian*. Available at: https://github.com/juliarodina/RuSemShift

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that I have accurately captured the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations as required.
