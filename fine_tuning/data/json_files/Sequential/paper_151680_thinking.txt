To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Generative Modeling Approach to Limited Channel ECG Classification" by Deepta Rajan and Jayaraman J. Thiagarajan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments with the **Physionet dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any additional context about datasets. The authors reference **MIMIC-III** and the **Physionet CinC challenge**, which may also imply the use of datasets related to these benchmarks.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset used. They specifically mention the **Physionet PTBDB**, which is comprised of ECGs collected from healthy volunteers and patients with various heart diseases. This section includes important details about the dataset, such as the number of records, subjects, and the nature of the data.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **Physionet PTBDB**, the citation is:
   > A. L. Goldberger, L. A. N. Amaral, L. Glass, J. M. Hausdorff, P. C. Ivanov, R. G. Mark, J. E. Mietus, G. B. Moody, C.-K. Peng, and H. E. Stanley. *PhysioBank, PhysioToolkit, and PhysioNet: Components of a new research resource for complex physiologic signals*. Circulation, vol. 101, no. 23, pp. e215â€“e220, 2000.

2. The authors also mention **MIMIC-III**, which is a well-known dataset in healthcare research. The citation for MIMIC-III is:
   > G. D. Clifford, C. Liu, B. Moody, L.-w. H. Lehman, I. Silva, Q. Li, A. Johnson, and R. G. Mark. *AF Classification from a short single lead ECG recording: the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017*. Computing, vol. 44, p. 1, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
