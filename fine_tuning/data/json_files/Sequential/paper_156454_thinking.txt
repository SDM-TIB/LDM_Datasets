To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards an end-to-end artificial intelligence driven global weather forecasting system" by Kun Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors typically describe the data preparation process. Here, I will look for specific datasets that were utilized in their experiments. The authors mention using the **ERA5 dataset** as the ground truth and source of simulated observations, which is a key dataset for their study.

In addition, the authors refer to the **Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS)** for real observational data. This indicates that GDAS is another dataset relevant to their research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **ERA5 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Hersbach, H., Bell, B., Berrisford, P., Hirahara, S., Horányi, A., Muñoz-Sabater, J., Nicolas, J., Peubey, C., Radu, R., Schepers, D., et al. *The ERA5 global reanalysis*. Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 146(730), 1999–2049, 2020.

2. For the **GDAS**, the citation is:
   > National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). *Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS)*. Available at: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/has/HAS.DsSelect.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing.
