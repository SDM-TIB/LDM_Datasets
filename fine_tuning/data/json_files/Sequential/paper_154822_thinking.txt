To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SCINet: Time Series Modeling and Forecasting with Sample Convolution and Interaction" by Minhao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that SCINet achieves significant forecasting accuracy improvements across various real-world time series forecasting datasets, indicating that multiple datasets are used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a list of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention that they conducted experiments on **11 popular time series datasets**. I will carefully note each dataset's name and any relevant details provided.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Electricity Transformer Temperature (ETTh)**: This dataset consists of electric power data collected from two counties in China, with various features related to temperature and power load.

2. **Traffic**: This dataset contains hourly data describing road occupancy rates recorded by sensors on freeways in the San Francisco Bay area.

3. **Solar-Energy**: This dataset records solar power production from multiple photovoltaic plants in Alabama, sampled every 10 minutes.

4. **Electricity**: This dataset includes hourly electricity consumption records from various clients.

5. **Exchange-Rate**: This dataset collects daily exchange rates of several foreign countries.

6. **PEMS (PEMS03, PEMS04, PEMS07, PEMS08)**: These datasets are constructed from traffic network data in California, aggregated into 5-minute windows.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that each dataset is properly cited. This will facilitate further research and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
