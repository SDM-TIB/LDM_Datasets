To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Task Temporal Convolutional Networks for Joint Recognition of Surgical Phases and Steps in Gastric Bypass Procedures" by Sanat Ramesh et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on a dataset consisting of 40 surgical procedures, referred to as **Bypass40**. This is a clear indication that a dataset is present.

Next, I will look closely at the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the need for a dataset with hierarchical annotations for surgical activities. They introduce the **Bypass40 dataset**, which contains 40 endoscopic videos of gastric bypass procedures annotated with both phases and steps. This section provides essential details about the dataset's purpose and structure.

In the **methodology section**, the authors provide further details about the **Bypass40 dataset**, including the number of videos, the average duration of the surgeries, and the annotations for phases and steps. They mention that the dataset consists of 11 phases and 44 steps, which are crucial for understanding the dataset's complexity.

To ensure I have all the necessary information, I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors reference the dataset again, confirming its use in their experiments. They mention the dataset multiple times, reinforcing its significance in their research.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the Bypass40 dataset is newly introduced in this paper and does not have a separate publication, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Sanat Ramesh, Diego Dallâ€™Alba, Cristians Gonzalez, Tong Yu, Pietro Mascagni, Didier Mutter, Jacques Marescaux, Paolo Fiorini, Nicolas Padoy. *Multi-Task Temporal Convolutional Networks for Joint Recognition of Surgical Phases and Steps in Gastric Bypass Procedures*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Information Processing in Computer-Assisted Interventions (IPCAI), 2021.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
