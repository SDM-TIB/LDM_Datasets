To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Increasing the Interpretability of Recurrent Neural Networks Using Hidden Markov Models" by Viktoriya Krakovna and Finale Doshi-Velez, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The introduction discusses the importance of interpretability in recurrent neural networks, but I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention testing their methods on two text datasets: **Tiny Shakespeare** and **Linux Kernel**. They also refer to using **ICU medical data** from the 2014 Physionet challenge. This indicates that there are at least three datasets to extract.

Next, I will gather details about each dataset. The paper specifies:

1. **Tiny Shakespeare**: A dataset containing 1 million characters of text from Shakespeare's works, used for training and evaluating the models.
2. **Linux Kernel**: A dataset consisting of 5 million characters of text from the Linux kernel source code, also used for model evaluation.
3. **ICU medical data**: This dataset is described as containing physiological signal features aimed at detecting heart beat windows, specifically mentioning a single-patient dataset with 200,000 time points and a multi-patient dataset with 15 training and 5 test patients.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets themselves, as they are commonly known datasets in the field. Therefore, I will use the following citations based on the known sources:

- For **Tiny Shakespeare**, the citation is:
  > Karpathy, A., Johnson, J., and Fei-Fei, L. (2016). Visualizing and Understanding Recurrent Networks. International Conference for Learning Representations Workshop Track.

- For **Linux Kernel**, the citation is also:
  > Karpathy, A., Johnson, J., and Fei-Fei, L. (2016). Visualizing and Understanding Recurrent Networks. International Conference for Learning Representations Workshop Track.

- For **Physionet ICU data**, the citation is:
  > PhysioNet. (2014). The PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2014. Available at: https://physionet.org/challenge/2014/

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
