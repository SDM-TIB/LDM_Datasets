To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An unsupervised latent/output physics-informed convolutional-LSTM network for solving partial differential equations using peridynamic differential operator" by Arda Mavi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference datasets used in previous studies. I will look for any citations or mentions of datasets that are relevant to their work.

In the **methodology section**, I will pay close attention to any specific experiments or numerical methods described. The authors may mention datasets used for training or testing their models, particularly in the context of the numerical experiments they conduct.

In the **results section**, I will look for any comparisons made with existing methods or datasets. The authors may provide details about the datasets used for validation or performance evaluation of their proposed method.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

From the paper, I have identified the following datasets:

1. **Burgers’ Equation Dataset**: This dataset is used to verify numerical solvers and is commonly referenced in studies involving fluid dynamics. The authors mention that it can model various phenomena such as traffic flow and hydrodynamic turbulence.

   Citation:
   > R. Courant, K. Friedrichs, and H. Lewy. *On the partial difference equations of mathematical physics*. IBM Journal of Research and Development, 11:215–234, 1967.

2. **Reaction-Diffusion Equation Dataset**: The authors reference a dataset provided by Rudy et al. for simulating the reaction-diffusion equation using a spectral method.

   Citation:
   > S. H. Rudy, S. L. Brunton, J. L. Proctor, and J. N. Kutz. *Data-driven discovery of partial differential equations*. Science Advances, 3:e1602614, 2017. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.1602614.

3. **Gray-Scott Equation Dataset**: This dataset is used for modeling chemical reactions and is referenced in the context of the Gray-Scott equation.

   Citation:
   > T. A. Driscoll, N. Hale, and L. N. Trefethen. *Chebfun guide*, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
