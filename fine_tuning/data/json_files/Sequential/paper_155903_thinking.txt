To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Benchmarking optimality of time series classification methods in distinguishing diffusions" by Zehong Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the study benchmarks TSC algorithms using diﬀusion processes, which suggests that datasets related to these processes may be included. The introduction will provide context and possibly name specific datasets or types of data used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any section that discusses the methodology in detail, likely around **section 4**. This section typically contains explicit mentions of datasets used for benchmarking. I will pay close attention to any descriptions of the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and how they were generated.

In this paper, the authors describe the generation of datasets based on diﬀusion processes. They mention generating data from stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and provide specific examples of diﬀusion processes. I will note down the types of diﬀusions mentioned, such as:

1. **Brownian motions with constant drifts**: The authors describe how these processes are generated and their relevance to the study.
2. **Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes**: Another type of diﬀusion process discussed in detail, including its mathematical formulation.
3. **Nonlinear diﬀusions**: The paper outlines how these are constructed and their significance in the context of TSC.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm which datasets were actually used in the benchmarking tests. This section often provides insights into the specific configurations and parameters of the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or foundational papers mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

For example, if the paper cites foundational works for the Brownian motion or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, I will extract those citations. If the authors created new datasets, I will document their descriptions and any relevant details provided in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as required. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant dataset information accurately and comprehensively.
