To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compositional Neural Machine Translation by Removing the Lexicon from Syntax" by Tristan Thrush, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but the experiments section is likely where the datasets will be detailed.

In the **experiments section**, the author mentions several datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Sequences of Color**: This dataset consists of 14 training pairs and 10 test pairs, where inputs are sequences of words from an artificial language and outputs are sequences of colored dots. The dataset is referenced from Lake et al. (2019).

2. **Geoquery**: This dataset is used for semantic parsing, where inputs are English geography queries and outputs are structured parses. The standard test set consists of 250 pairs, and the dataset is cited from Zelle (1995) and the Geoquery Data (2020).

3. **Wall Street Journal (WSJ) Syntactic Parsing Dataset**: This dataset includes English sentences paired with human-generated phrase parses. The author uses a specific subset from Kim et al. (2019), which is noted in the paper.

4. **Tatoeba English to Chinese Translation Dataset**: This dataset is a product of a crowd-sourced effort to translate sentences into Mandarin Chinese. The dataset is processed by Kelly (2020) and is mentioned in the context of the experiments.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Sequences of Color**, the citation is:
  > Lake, B., Linzen, T., & Baroni, M. (2019). *Human few-shot learning of compositional instructions*. Proceedings of the 41st Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society.

- For **Geoquery**, the citation is:
  > Zelle, J. (1995). *Using inductive logic programming to automate the construction of natural language parsers*. Unpublished doctoral dissertation, Department of Computer Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX.

- For the **Geoquery Data**, the citation is:
  > Geoquery data. (2020, January 14). Retrieved from http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ml/nldata/geoquery.html

- For the **Wall Street Journal Syntactic Parsing Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marcus, M., Marcinkiewicz, M., & Santorini, B. (1993). *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19, 313-330.

- For the **Tatoeba English to Chinese Translation Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ho, T. (2020, January 14). *Tatoeba*. Retrieved from https://tatoeba.org

- For the processing of the Tatoeba dataset, the citation is:
  > Kelly, C. (2020, January 3). *Bilingual sentence pairs*. Retrieved from https://www.manythings.org/anki/

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be clearly documented with its name, description, and full citation to ensure proper attribution and clarity.
