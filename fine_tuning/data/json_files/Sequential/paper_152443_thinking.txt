To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Longitudinal detection of radiological abnormalities with time-modulated LSTM" by Ruggiero Santeramo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses both a simulated dataset and a large-scale chest x-ray dataset, which suggests that I need to look for specific names and details in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Motivating dataset and problem formulation)**, where the authors describe the dataset collected from the PACS archives at Guy’s and St. Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust. Here, they provide details about the dataset, including the number of chest radiographs, the patient population, and the time period of data collection. The dataset consists of 745,480 chest radiographs, which is a significant detail.

In this section, I will also note that they extracted a subset of 80,737 patients, resulting in 337,575 images, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's scale and application.

Additionally, I will look for the **simulated dataset** mentioned in **section 4 (Simulated data)**. The authors describe how they generated simulated data to assess the performance of their models. This dataset is characterized by sequences of images with varying lengths and specific patterns inspired by radiological abnormalities.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the large-scale chest x-ray dataset, but it is implied that it is derived from the PACS archives. I will need to cite the original source of the dataset if available.

For the simulated dataset, since it is generated by the authors, I will note that it does not have a formal citation but will describe it based on the details provided in the paper.

Here are the datasets I will extract:

1. **Chest X-ray Dataset**: 
   - Description: A dataset collected from the PACS archives at Guy’s and St. Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, consisting of 745,480 chest radiographs from 80,737 patients.
   - Citation: While the paper does not provide a specific citation, I will reference the PACS system and the institution.

2. **Simulated Dataset**: 
   - Description: A dataset generated by the authors consisting of sequences of images with varying lengths, designed to mimic radiological patterns.
   - Citation: No formal citation, as it is a synthetic dataset created for the study.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the descriptions and citations, ensuring that I accurately represent the datasets used in the research.
