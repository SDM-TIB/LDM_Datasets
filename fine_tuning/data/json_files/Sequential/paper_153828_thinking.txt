To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Supervised Contrastive Learning" by Prannay Khosla et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions achieving state-of-the-art performance on the **ImageNet dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4, the authors discuss their evaluation on several benchmarks, including:

1. **ImageNet**: This is a well-known large-scale dataset for image classification tasks. The authors report achieving a top-1 accuracy of 81.4% on this dataset using their proposed method.

2. **CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100**: These are smaller datasets commonly used for benchmarking image classification algorithms. The authors provide accuracy results for these datasets as well, indicating their use in the experiments.

3. **ImageNet-C**: This dataset is used to evaluate the robustness of the models against common image corruptions. The authors mention measuring performance on this dataset, which is crucial for understanding the robustness of their approach.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009.

- For **CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet-C**, the citation is:
  > Dan Hendrycks and Thomas Dietterich. *Benchmarking neural network robustness to common corruptions and perturbations*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.12261, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
