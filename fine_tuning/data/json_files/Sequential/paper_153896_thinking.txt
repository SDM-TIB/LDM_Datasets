To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sparse Mixture of Local Experts for Efficient Speech Enhancement" by Aswin Sivaraman and Minje Kim, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a deep learning approach for speech denoising, but it does not specify datasets. The introduction elaborates on the speech denoising problem but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **experiment setup section**. Here, the authors describe the training and testing processes, mentioning two specific datasets:

1. **LibriSpeech Corpus**: This dataset is used for training the models and is noted to contain clean speech recordings. The paper states that it is available for download at http://www.openslr.org/12/.

2. **MUSAN Corpus**: This dataset is used for noise recordings during training. The authors provide a link for this dataset as well, stating it is available at http://www.openslr.org/17/.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **LibriSpeech Corpus**, the citation is:
  > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *LibriSpeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2015, pp. 5206â€“5210.

- For the **MUSAN Corpus**, the citation is:
  > D. Snyder, G. Chen, and D. Povey. *MUSAN: A Music, Speech, and Noise Corpus*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1510.08484, 2015.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included as required. This will facilitate further processing or review of the dataset information.
