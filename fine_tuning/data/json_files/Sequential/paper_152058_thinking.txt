To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Encoding Sentences with Graph Convolutional Networks for Semantic Role Labeling" by Diego Marcheggiani and Ivan Titov, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved state-of-the-art results on the **CoNLL-2009** benchmark for both Chinese and English. This indicates that the CoNLL-2009 dataset is likely one of the primary datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention that they tested their model on the **English and Chinese CoNLL-2009 datasets** with standard splits into training, test, and development sets. This confirms that both datasets are indeed utilized in their research.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The CoNLL-2009 dataset is widely recognized in the NLP community, and its citation is as follows:

- For the **CoNLL-2009 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Johan Bos, et al. *The CoNLL-2009 Shared Task: Syntactic and Semantic Dependencies in Multiple Languages*. In Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL), pages 1-18, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **CoNLL-2009 English Dataset**: Used for semantic role labeling tasks, providing annotated sentences in English.
2. **CoNLL-2009 Chinese Dataset**: Similar to the English dataset but for Chinese sentences, also annotated for semantic role labeling.

I will ensure that the citations are included in the final output to maintain academic integrity and provide proper credit to the original sources.
