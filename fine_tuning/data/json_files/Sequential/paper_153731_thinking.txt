To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Localized Flood Detection With Minimal Labeled Social Media Data Using Transfer Learning" by Neha Singh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses using social media data for flood detection, which suggests that datasets from social media platforms like Twitter may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Data Collection and Processing section**. Here, the authors mention using the **CrisisLexT6 dataset**, which contains tweets related to various crisis events, specifically focusing on flood-related tweets from two events: the Queensland flood in Australia and the Alberta flood in Canada. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including its purpose and the specific tweets used for the study.

In this section, the authors also provide a breakdown of the data distribution, indicating that there are 5,414 related tweets and 4,619 unrelated tweets. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the **CrisisLexT6 dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Olteanu, A.; Castillo, C.; Diaz, F.; and Vieweg, S. 2014. Crisislex: A lexicon for collecting and filtering microblogged communications in crises. In Eighth International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media.

Additionally, I will note that the authors also mention using tweets from two specific flood events, but they do not provide separate citations for these events since they are part of the CrisisLexT6 dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation for the CrisisLexT6 dataset. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that all relevant information is included and accurately cited.
