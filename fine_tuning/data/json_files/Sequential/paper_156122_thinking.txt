To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Everybody Compose: Deep Beats To Music" by Conghao Shen, Violet Z. Yao, and Yixin Liu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the project, but I need to look for specific dataset references in the main body of the paper.

In **section 3 (Dataset and Features)**, the authors explicitly mention the **MAESTRO dataset**. They describe it as a large-scale collection of piano performances MIDI files compiled by the Magenta research team at Google. The dataset consists of over 200 hours of recordings and 6.18 million notes from competition virtuoso pianists. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's contents and its relevance to the study.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MAESTRO dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Curtis Hawthorne, Andriy Stasyuk, Adam Roberts, Ian Simon, Cheng-Zhi Anna Huang, Sander Dieleman, Erich Elsen, Jesse Engel, and Douglas Eck. *Enabling factorized piano music modeling and generation with the MAESTRO dataset*. In International Conference on Learning Representations. https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1lYRjC9F7, 2019.

Since the MAESTRO dataset is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete.
