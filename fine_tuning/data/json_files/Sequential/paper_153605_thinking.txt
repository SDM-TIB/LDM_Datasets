To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GridMask Data Augmentation" by Pengguang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on several datasets, specifically mentioning **ImageNet**, **COCO2017**, and **Cityscapes**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for the experiments and should be included.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) in detail, as it typically contains specific information about the datasets used. In section 4.1, the authors discuss their experiments on **ImageNet** for image classification, **COCO2017** for object detection, and **Cityscapes** for semantic segmentation. Each of these datasets is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the GridMask augmentation method.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the experiments.

1. **ImageNet**: The citation for the ImageNet dataset is:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

2. **COCO2017**: The citation for the COCO dataset is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Sergio F. Avidan, et al. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

3. **Cityscapes**: The citation for the Cityscapes dataset is:
   > Mario Fritz, et al. *The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its purpose in the experiments, and the corresponding citations. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly credited in any subsequent analysis or application of the research findings.
