To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine Learning for Classification of Protein Helix Capping Motifs" by Sean Mullane et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions using structural data and helix cap classification data from CAPS-DB, which indicates that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **data pre-processing section**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their study. They mention two primary data sources:

1. **Protein Data Bank (PDB)**: This is a comprehensive database of 3D biomolecular structures. The authors state that they extracted secondary structural information from the PDB, which is crucial for their analysis.

2. **CAPS-DB**: This is a relational database specifically containing helix cap information, which the authors used as ground truth for their classification task. They mention that CAPS-DB contains 67,530 helix caps across 7,390 proteins.

In addition, they reference a third data source, **FEATURE**, which computes various atomic features for each atom within a protein structure. This dataset is used to enhance their feature set for the machine learning models.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Protein Data Bank (PDB)**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation, I can reference the general citation for the PDB:
  > Berman, H. M., Westbrook, J., Feng, Z., Gilliland, G., Bhat, T. N., Weissig, H., & Shindyalov, I. N. (2000). The Protein Data Bank. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 28(1), 235-242.

- For **CAPS-DB**, the citation provided in the paper is:
  > Segura, J., Oliva, B., & Fernandez-Fuentes, N. (2012). CAPS-DB: a structural classification of helix-capping motifs. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 40(Database issue), D479-85.

- For **FEATURE**, the citation is:
  > Bagley, S. C., & Altman, R. B. (1995). Characterizing the microenvironment surrounding protein sites. *Protein Science*, 4(4), 622-635.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
