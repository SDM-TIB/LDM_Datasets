To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Language Modeling using Densely Connected Recurrent Neural Networks" by Frédéric Godin, Joni Dambre, and Wesley De Neve, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their architecture on the **Penn Treebank language modeling task**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the **Penn Treebank (PTB) corpus**. They describe the dataset in detail, noting that it contains 930,000 training words, 74,000 validation words, and 82,000 test words, with a vocabulary limited to 10,000 words. This section confirms that the PTB corpus is the primary dataset used for their evaluations.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Penn Treebank dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **Penn Treebank**:
  > Mikolov, T., & Zweig, G. (2012). Context dependent recurrent neural network language model. In Proceedings of the IEEE Workshop on Spoken Language Technology.

Since the paper does not mention any additional datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Penn Treebank dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Penn Treebank, ensuring that it is clear and complete for any downstream processing or review.
