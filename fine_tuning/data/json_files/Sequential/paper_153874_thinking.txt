To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Context-Sensitive Generation Network for Handling Unknown Slot Values in Dialogue State Tracking" by Puhai Yang, Heyan Huang, and Xian-Ling Mao, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the importance of dialogue state tracking and mentions experiments conducted on specific benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that their experiments are conducted on **DSTC2** and **MultiWOZ 2.1** datasets. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in this section.

In section 4.1, the authors provide specific details about the datasets:

1. **DSTC2**: This dataset is described as a traditional standard dialogue state tracking benchmark focused on a single restaurant domain. It contains 1,612 training dialogues, 506 development dialogues, and 1,117 test dialogues.

2. **MultiWOZ 2.1**: This dataset is noted as a corrected version of the MultiWOZ dataset, containing around 10,000 dialogues with an average of 6.85 turns per dialogue. It includes over 30 slots and 988 possible slot values.

Additionally, the authors mention a **modified MultiWOZ 2.1** dataset created for their experiments, which eliminates certain slots to focus on the extraction of unknown slot values.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **DSTC2**, the citation is:
  > M. Henderson, B. Thomson, and J. D. Williams. *The second dialog state tracking challenge*. In Proceedings of the 15th annual meeting of the special interest group on discourse and dialogue (SIGDIAL), 2014, pp. 263â€“272.

- For **MultiWOZ 2.1**, the citation is:
  > M. Eric, R. Goel, S. Paul, A. Sethi, S. Agarwal, S. Gao, and D. Hakkani-Tur. *MultiWOZ 2.1: Multi-domain dialogue state corrections and state tracking baselines*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.01669, 2019.

- For the **modified MultiWOZ 2.1**, since it is a variant of the original MultiWOZ dataset, I will reference the same citation as MultiWOZ 2.1.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
