To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Macroeconomic Forecasting with LSTM and Mixed Frequency Time Series Data" by Sarun Kamolthip, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the author mentions using a "vast array of macroeconomic indicators both quarterly and monthly" for forecasting the quarterly growth rate of Thai real GDP. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Empirical application to Thai GDP growth)**, where the author discusses the datasets used for the empirical analysis. Here, the author states that they collected all quarterly and monthly series available in the Bank of Thailand (BOT) database. The paper mentions that the final dataset contains five quarterly and 35 monthly series, but I need to extract the specific names and identifiers of these datasets.

In **Appendix B**, the author provides a detailed description of the datasets, including their identifiers and the first available observation period. I will compile this information to ensure I have the complete dataset details.

The datasets mentioned in the paper include:

1. **Quarterly GDP (QGDP)**: This dataset is crucial for the analysis and is sourced from the Office of the National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC). The growth rate is calculated directly from this series.

2. **Monthly and Quarterly Macroeconomic Indicators**: The paper lists various indicators such as:
   - Manufacturing production index
   - Gross value added tax (at 2000 prices)
   - Domestic automobiles sales
   - Business sentiment indexes
   - Retail sales indexes
   - Wholesales indexes
   - Number of foreign tourists
   - Various financial indicators (e.g., treasury bills, FX rates)

I will now retrieve the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper. For example, the quarterly GDP data citation would be:
> Office of the National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC). *Quarterly GDP series in chained volumes*. Available from: [insert URL or DOI if available].

For the other datasets, I will follow a similar approach, ensuring to document the source and any relevant details for each dataset.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its full citation, ready for further analysis or use in downstream applications.
