To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data Augmentation Using Pre-trained Transformer Models" by Varun Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on data augmentation techniques, but it does not specify datasets. The introduction discusses various data augmentation methods but does not name specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe three text classification datasets:

1. **SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)**: This dataset is used for sentiment classification on movie reviews, annotated with two labels (Positive and Negative).

2. **SNIPS**: This dataset contains 7 intents collected from the Snips personal voice assistant, which is used for intent classification.

3. **TREC**: This is a fine-grained question classification dataset sourced from TREC, containing six question types (e.g., person, location, etc.).

In this section, the authors also mention that they used specific versions of the SST-2 and TREC datasets provided by Wu et al. (2019) and that they used a specific version of the SNIPS dataset.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SST-2**, the citation is:
  > Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D Manning, Andrew Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing, pages 1631–1642, 2013.

- For **SNIPS**, the citation is:
  > Alice Coucke, Alaa Saade, Adrien Ball, Théodore Bluche, Alexandre Caulier, David Leroy, Clément Doumouro, Thibault Gisselbrecht, Francesco Caltagirone, Thibaut Lavril, et al. *Snips voice platform: an embedded spoken language understanding system for private-by-design voice interfaces*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.10190, 2018.

- For **TREC**, the citation is:
  > Xin Li and Dan Roth. *Learning question classifiers*. In Proceedings of the 19th international conference on Computational linguistics-Volume 1, pages 1–7. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2002.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
