To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NSGA-Net: Neural Architecture Search using Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm" by Zhichao Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that NSGA-Net is evaluated on the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, which is a clear indication that this dataset is used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the success of deep convolutional networks and mentions various architectures but does not introduce new datasets.

Moving on to the **experiments section (Section 4)**, I will focus on **subsection 4.1 (Performance Metrics)**, where the authors specify that they consider the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for their classification task. They also mention splitting the original training set to create training and validation sets, but the dataset remains the same.

In **subsection 4.2 (Implementation Details)**, the authors reiterate that they use the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for their architecture search and provide details about how they split the dataset for training and validation purposes.

Finally, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*. ([n. d.]). http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

The only dataset mentioned in this paper is the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, and I will ensure to include its full citation in my final output.
