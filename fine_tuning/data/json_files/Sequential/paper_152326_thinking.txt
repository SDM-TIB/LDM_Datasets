To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Open Knowledge Acquisition via Long Short-Term Memory Networks with Feedback Negative Sampling" by Byungsoo Kim, Hwanjo Yu, and Gary Geunbae Lee, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the construction of training samples for LSTM networks, which suggests that there may be datasets involved, particularly for training and evaluation purposes.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Automatically Constructing the Training Set)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for training the model. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this section, the authors mention that there are no prevalent datasets for training Open IE systems, which indicates that they may have created their own datasets or used existing ones. I will pay close attention to any descriptions of how they constructed their training samples, as this may lead to the identification of specific datasets.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if the authors report on any datasets used for evaluation purposes. This section often provides insights into the datasets that were utilized to validate the proposed methods.

After identifying any datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

If the authors created their own datasets, I will look for any references to prior works or methodologies that informed their dataset construction, as these may also need to be cited.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the full citation, as this is essential for academic integrity and for readers who may wish to explore the datasets further.
