To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CAN AI GENERATE LOVE ADVICE?: TOWARD NEURAL ANSWER GENERATION FOR NON-FACTOID QUESTIONS" by Makoto Nakatsuji, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their model using datasets from the Japanese QA site, Oshiete goo, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the author discusses the datasets used for the experiments. The paper mentions that the evaluation was conducted using a dataset containing approximately **5,000 question-conclusion-supplement sentences** extracted from the Oshiete goo platform. This is a significant dataset that I need to note.

Additionally, I will look for any specific details about the dataset in the **methodology section**. The author mentions that the dataset was built using **189,511 questions and 771,956 answers** stored in **16 categories**, including "Love Advice." This provides a clearer picture of the dataset's scope and size.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are derived from the Oshiete goo platform, I will cite the platform itself as the source of the dataset:

- For the dataset from **Oshiete goo**, the citation is:
  > Oshiete goo. *Japanese online question and answer service*. Available at: http://oshiete.goo.ne.jp

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself, I will use the citation for the platform where the dataset was sourced.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Oshiete goo dataset as required. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented for future reference or analysis.
