To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Relational Graph Learning on Visual and Kinematics Embeddings for Accurate Gesture Recognition in Robotic Surgery" by Yonghao Long et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **JIGSAWS dataset** for evaluation, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors explicitly state that they evaluated their method on the **public JIGSAWS dataset** and also validated their method on **in-house visual-kinematics datasets** collected with da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) platforms. This suggests that there are multiple datasets involved.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide specific details about the **JIGSAWS dataset**, which consists of 39 videos for suturing and 36 videos for knot typing, along with kinematics data from robotic arms. This dataset is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

Additionally, they mention the **in-house datasets** collected from CUHK and JHU, specifically for the peg transfer task, which includes 24 sequences of gestures. This dataset is also important for the validation of their method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **JIGSAWS dataset**, the citation is:
   > Y. Gao, S. S. Vedula, C. E. Reiley, N. Ahmidi, B. Varadarajan, H. C. Lin, L. Tao, L. Zappella, B. BÂ´ejar, D. D. Yuh, et al. "JHU-ISI Gesture and Skill Assessment Working Set (JIGSAWS): A Surgical Activity Dataset for Human Motion Modeling." In MICCAI Workshop: M2CAI, vol. 3, 2014, p. 3.

2. For the **in-house datasets**, since they are not formally published, I will note that they were collected from CUHK and JHU using the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) platforms. The authors do not provide a formal citation for these datasets, but I will mention them as in-house datasets for the peg transfer task.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that each dataset is properly referenced for clarity and completeness.
