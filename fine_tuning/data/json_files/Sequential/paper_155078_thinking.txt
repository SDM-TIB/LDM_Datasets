To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lookup or Exploratory: What is Your Search Intent?" by Manoj K Agarwal and Tezan Sahu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Heuristic-based Classification)**, as it appears to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the study. In this section, the authors mention that they obtained intent labels for **25 million queries from Bing logs**, which is a significant dataset. I will note this dataset and its context.

I will also check **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss their experimental setup and may provide additional details about the datasets used for training and testing their models. They mention a human-judged test dataset containing **302 representative queries**, which is another dataset of interest.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide formal citations for the datasets in the traditional sense, but I can construct them based on the information provided:

1. **Bing Logs Dataset**: This dataset consists of 25 million queries labeled for intent classification. The citation can be formatted as:
   > Agarwal, M. K., & Sahu, T. (2021). Lookup or Exploratory: What is Your Search Intent? *Proceedings of the Conference on Human Information Interaction & Retrieval*.

2. **Human-Judged Test Dataset**: This dataset includes 302 queries labeled by human judges. The citation can be similarly formatted:
   > Agarwal, M. K., & Sahu, T. (2021). Lookup or Exploratory: What is Your Search Intent? *Proceedings of the Conference on Human Information Interaction & Retrieval*.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have captured all relevant details and context surrounding their use in the research. This will help in accurately documenting the datasets for future reference or analysis.

Finally, I will summarize my findings and prepare to present the dataset information in a structured format, ensuring that the citations are clear and complete for each dataset identified.
