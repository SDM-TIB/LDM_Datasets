To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Long Short-Term Memory Adaptive Beamforming Networks for Multichannel Robust Speech Recognition" by Zhong Meng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved significant performance improvements using the **CHiME-3 dataset** for their experiments, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (specifically section 3.1) where the authors provide detailed information about the **CHiME-3 dataset**. They describe it as a dataset released with the 3rd CHiME speech separation and recognition challenge, which includes both real and simulated data. The authors detail the composition of the dataset, including the number of utterances and the environments in which they were recorded.

In section 3.1, the authors provide specifics about the dataset:
- The training set consists of 1600 real noisy utterances from 4 speakers and 7138 simulated noisy utterances from 83 speakers recorded in 4 noisy environments.
- The development set includes 3280 utterances, and the test set has 2640 utterances, with all speakers being mutually different across the sets.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the **CHiME-3 dataset**. The relevant citation is:
> J. Barker, R. Marxer, E. Vincent, and S. Watanabe. "The third CHiME speech separation and recognition challenge: Dataset, task and baselines." In Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding (ASRU), pages 504â€“511, Dec 2015.

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the dataset details and ensure that the full citation is included. The dataset entry will focus on the CHiME-3 dataset, as it is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all relevant details and citations are accurately represented.
