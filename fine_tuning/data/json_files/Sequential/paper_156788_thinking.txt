To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Natively neuromorphic LMU architecture for encoding-free SNN-based HAR on commercial edge devices" by Vittorio Fra et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for validation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in the study.

In the **introduction**, I notice that the authors mention the use of the **WISDM smartphone and smartwatch activity and biometrics dataset** as a specific use case for Human Activity Recognition (HAR). This indicates that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **results sections**. In the methodology, the authors describe the WISDM dataset in detail, stating that it includes recordings from sensors worn by 51 subjects performing 18 different tasks. This section provides valuable information about the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the WISDM dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **WISDM Smartphone and Smartwatch Activity and Biometrics Dataset**:
  > Weiss, G.M. (2019). *WISDM Smartphone and Smartwatch Activity and Biometrics Dataset*. UCI Machine Learning Repository. Retrieved from https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2940729

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the WISDM dataset, ensuring it is ready for any further processing or review.
