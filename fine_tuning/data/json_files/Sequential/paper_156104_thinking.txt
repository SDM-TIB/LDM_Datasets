To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Monotonic Location Attention for Length Generalization" by Jishnu Ray Chowdhury and Cornelia Caragea, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the exploration of position-based cross-attention and mentions the benefits of their approaches for length generalization in SCAN and CFQ, indicating that these might be datasets of interest.

Next, I will look into the **experiments** section, particularly focusing on any subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. The authors mention using SCAN and CFQ for their experiments, which suggests that these are the datasets they utilized.

In the **experiments section**, I will find specific details about each dataset:

1. **SCAN Dataset**: This dataset is used for testing systematic generalization and involves translating simple commands into sequences of actions. The authors reference Lake & Baroni (2018) as the source for this dataset.

2. **CFQ Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating compositional generalization in query-to-SQL translation tasks. The authors cite Keysers et al. (2020) as the source for this dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for SCAN and CFQ:

- For the **SCAN Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lake, B. M., & Baroni, M. (2018). Generalization without systematicity: On the compositional skills of sequence-to-sequence recurrent networks. In Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 80, 2873-2882.

- For the **CFQ Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Keysers, D., Sch√§rli, N., Scales, N., Buisman, H., Furrer, D., Kashubin, S., Momchev, N., Sinopalnikov, D., Stafiak, L., Tihon, T., Tsarkov, D., Wang, X., van Zee, M., & Bousquet, O. (2020). Measuring compositional generalization: A comprehensive method on realistic data. In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
