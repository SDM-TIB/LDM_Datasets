To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Approximate FPGA-based LSTMs under Computation Time Constraints" by Michalis Rizakis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not detail specific datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the introduction, where the authors often discuss related work and may reference datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the methodology or evaluation sections. In this paper, the authors mention using a subset of the **Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset** for their experiments. This is a significant finding, as it indicates the dataset used for evaluation.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the COCO dataset. The citation for the COCO dataset is as follows:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Sergio F. G. Vasconcelos, et al. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will focus solely on the COCO dataset for my extraction.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the COCO dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference.

In summary, the steps I will take are:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections for dataset mentions.
2. Identify the **Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset** as the primary dataset used.
3. Retrieve the full citation for the COCO dataset from the references.
4. Document the dataset information clearly, including the citation.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately extract and document the dataset used in the research paper.
