To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GM-TCNet: Gated Multi-scale Temporal Convolutional Network using Emotion Causality for Speech Emotion Recognition" by Jia-Xin Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on four commonly used datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets to identify.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **CASIA Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 1200 samples of Chinese speech emotion data, with emotions including Angry, Happy, Sad, and others.

2. **Berlin Emotional Dataset (EMODB)**: This dataset consists of 535 samples of German emotional speech, with emotions such as Angry, Boredom, and Fear.

3. **Ryerson Audio-Visual Dataset of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS)**: This dataset includes 1440 samples of English emotional speech, covering emotions like Angry, Calm, and Disgust.

4. **Surrey Audio-Visual Expressed Emotion Dataset (SAVEE)**: This dataset contains 480 samples of English emotional speech, with emotions including Angry, Disgust, and Fear.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Berlin Emotional Dataset (EMODB)**:

- **RAVDESS**:

- **SAVEE**:
  > Jackson, P., & Haq, S. (2012). Surrey audio-visual expressed emotion (SAVEE) database. University of Surrey: Guildford, UK.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
