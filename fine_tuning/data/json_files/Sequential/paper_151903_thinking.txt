To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Nested LSTMs" by Joel Ruben Antony Moniz and David Krueger, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate Nested LSTMs on various datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for their evaluations. This section is likely to provide explicit names and descriptions of the datasets.

In **section 4.1**, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Penn Treebank Corpus**: This dataset is described as containing around 1 million words and is used for character-level language modeling.

2. **Text8 Dataset**: This dataset comprises the first 100MB of a cleaned-up version of enwik8, which is derived from Wikipedia text.

3. **Chinese Poem Generation Dataset**: Specifically, the subset used consists of quatrains with 5 characters each, and it has a specified train/validation/test split.

4. **MNIST Glimpses Task**: This dataset involves images split into quadrants, where glimpses of each quadrant are fed sequentially into the model.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Penn Treebank Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Marcus, M. P., Marcinkiewicz, M. A., & Santorini, B. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313-330.

- For the **Text8 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mahoney, M. (2011). About the test data. Retrieved from http://mattmahoney.net/dc/textdata.

- For the **Chinese Poem Generation Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, S., & Lapata, M. (2014). Chinese poetry generation with recurrent neural networks. In *EMNLP* (pp. 670-680).

- For the **MNIST Glimpses Task**, the citation is:
  > Ba, J., Kiros, J. R., & Hinton, G. E. (2016). Layer normalization. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1607.06450*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets along with their full citations, which is crucial for any downstream applications or analyses.
