It is a very challenging dataset since it contains more than 1000 speakers and large variations in head pose and illumination. For each target word, it has a training set of 1000 segments, a validation and an evaluation set of 50 segments each. The total duration of this corpus is 173 hours. The corpus with 500 words is also much larger than previous lip-reading databases used for word recognition.",
