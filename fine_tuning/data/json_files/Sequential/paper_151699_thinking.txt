To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Handwriting Trajectory Recovery using End-to-End Deep Encoder-Decoder Network" by Ayan Kumar Bhunia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used the **LIPI Toolkit dataset** for their experiments, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they used the **LIPI Toolkit dataset**, which contains character-level online data from three Indic scripts: Tamil, Telugu, and Devanagari. This confirms the dataset's relevance to their research.

I will also check the **implementation details** and **results** sections to gather more information about how the dataset was utilized. The authors describe how they generated their dataset by converting online data to offline images, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and application.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the **LIPI Toolkit dataset**. The paper mentions that the dataset can be found at the following URL:
> LIPI Toolkit dataset. Available at: http://lipitk.sourceforge.net/hpl-datasets.htm

Since the dataset is hosted online and does not have a traditional citation format, I will note it as an online resource.

In summary, I have identified the following dataset from the paper:

1. **LIPI Toolkit Dataset**: This dataset contains character-level online data from Tamil, Telugu, and Devanagari scripts, which was used for training the proposed handwriting trajectory recovery model.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> LIPI Toolkit dataset. Available at: http://lipitk.sourceforge.net/hpl-datasets.htm

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
