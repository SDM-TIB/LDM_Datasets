To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recursive Graphical Neural Networks for Text Classification" by Wei Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "widely used benchmark datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiment section**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two tasks: single label classification and multiple label classification. They provide a list of datasets for each task.

For the **single label classification task**, the datasets mentioned are:
1. **Ohsumed**: A dataset from the MEDLINE database with 7,400 documents, each associated with one of 23 disease categories.
2. **R8**: A subset of the Reuters21578 dataset with 8 categories.
3. **R52**: Another subset of the Reuters21578 dataset with 52 categories.
4. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**: An extension of the Movie Review dataset with fine-grained sentiment labels.
5. **Movie Review (MR)**: A dataset for binary sentiment classification.

For the **multiple label classification task**, the datasets mentioned are:
1. **Reuters21578**: A dataset consisting of documents from the Reuters Newswire in 1987.
2. **Ohsumed**: The full version of the Ohsumed dataset, which includes all abstracts and their corresponding labels.

Now, I will look in the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the experiments.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:
- **Ohsumed**: 
  > Hersh, W., et al. "Ohsumed: A dataset for research in information retrieval." *Proceedings of the 1994 ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval*, 1994.
  
- **Reuters21578**: 
  > Lewis, D. D., et al. "Reuters-21578 text categorization test collection." *Linguistic Data Consortium*, 1997.
  
- **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**: 
  > Socher, R., et al. "Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank." *Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing*, 2013.
  
- **Movie Review (MR)**: 
  > Pang, B., and Lee, L. "Seeing stars: Exploiting class relationships for sentiment categorization with respect to rating scales." *Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics*, 2005.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all datasets are accurately represented and properly cited.
