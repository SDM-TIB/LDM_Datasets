To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Best of Both Worlds: Combining Recent Advances in Neural Machine Translation" by Mia Xu Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on benchmark datasets, specifically the **WMT’14 English→French** and **WMT’14 English→German** tasks. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 3) to confirm the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, the authors explicitly state that they train their models on the **WMT’14 En→Fr** and **WMT’14 En→De** datasets, which consist of 36.3 million and 4.5 million sentence pairs, respectively. This provides clear confirmation of the datasets utilized in their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The WMT datasets are commonly referenced in the literature, so I will look for the appropriate citations:

1. For the **WMT’14 English→French** dataset, the citation is:
   > Bojar, O., et al. (2014). *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 1-30.

2. For the **WMT’14 English→German** dataset, the citation is:
   > Bojar, O., et al. (2014). *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 1-30.

Since both datasets are part of the same workshop proceedings, they share the same citation.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will summarize the findings:

1. **WMT’14 English→French**: A dataset consisting of 36.3 million sentence pairs used for machine translation tasks.
2. **WMT’14 English→German**: A dataset consisting of 4.5 million sentence pairs used for machine translation tasks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference or processing.
