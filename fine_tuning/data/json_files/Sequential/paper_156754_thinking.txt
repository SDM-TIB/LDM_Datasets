To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling of New Energy Vehicles' Impact on Urban Ecology Focusing on Behavior" by Run-Xuan Tang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the impact of new energy vehicles on urban ecology and mentions behavioral analysis, which may suggest the presence of datasets related to vehicle usage patterns.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the author discusses various studies and their findings related to new energy vehicles and battery management. I will look for any references to specific datasets used in these studies or any data that the author may have collected for their own analysis.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in the **Urban Ecosystem Modeling** and **Data Extending** subsections, I will look for any mention of datasets that were utilized for modeling or simulation purposes. The author describes using an LSTM model and mentions data collection and processing, which indicates that there are datasets involved in the analysis.

I will also check the **results section** for any tables or figures that summarize data findings, as these often indicate the datasets used for analysis. The paper includes various metrics and evaluation indicators, which may be derived from specific datasets.

After identifying potential datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the paper refers to existing datasets from other studies, I will ensure to include those citations as well.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset related to electric vehicle charging behavior, I will look for the original source of that dataset and provide the full citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
