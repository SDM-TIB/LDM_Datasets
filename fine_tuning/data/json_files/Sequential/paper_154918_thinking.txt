To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MOHAQ: Multi-Objective Hardware-Aware Quantization of Recurrent Neural Networks" by Nesma M. Rezk et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their method to a speech recognition model using the **TIMIT dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is relevant to their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to confirm the use of the TIMIT dataset and check if there are any additional datasets mentioned. In the introduction, the authors state that they selected the TIMIT dataset due to its popularity in speech recognition research, which reinforces its significance in their experiments.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the model used for their experiments and explicitly mention the TIMIT dataset as the dataset for training and evaluation. This confirms that the TIMIT dataset is indeed the primary dataset utilized in their research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the TIMIT dataset. The citation for the TIMIT dataset is as follows:
> J. Garofolo et al., “DARPA TIMIT acoustic-phonetic continuous speech corpus cd-rom. NIST speech disc 1-1.1,” NASA STI/Recon Technical Report N, vol. 93, p. 27403, 1993.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information regarding the TIMIT dataset into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry includes the full citation, as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference in future work. After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entry for the TIMIT dataset, ready for inclusion in any required output format.
