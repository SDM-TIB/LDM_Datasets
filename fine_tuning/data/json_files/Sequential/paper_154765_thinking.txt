To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pouring Dynamics Estimation Using Gated Recurrent Units" by Qi Zheng, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to delve deeper into the body of the paper for specific dataset details.

In **section II (Data and Preprocessing)**, the author describes a dataset that contains a total of **688 pouring sequences** along with their corresponding weight measurements. This section outlines the features of the dataset, which include:

- Rotation angle at time t (degree)
- Weight at time t (lbf)
- Weight before pouring (lbf)
- Weight aimed to be poured in the receiving cup (lbf)
- Height of the pouring cup (mm)
- Diameter of the pouring cup (mm)
- Velocity of the pouring cup (rad/s)

The author also mentions that the sequences are padded with zeros to fit a standard length of 700, and that masking is used during training to exclude these padded zeros. This indicates that the dataset is well-structured for training a neural network.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. The author refers to a detailed data collection process in reference [18], which is crucial for providing the full citation of the dataset used.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Yongqiang Huang, Yu Sun. *A Dataset of Daily Interactive Manipulation*. SAGE Journals, 2019. Available at: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0278364919849091.

Since this dataset is the primary one discussed in the paper, I will ensure to include it in my final output.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the necessary details, including the full citation, ensuring that it is ready for downstream processing or review.
