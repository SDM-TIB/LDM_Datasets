To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The NU Voice Conversion System for the Voice Conversion Challenge 2020: On the Effectiveness of Sequence-to-sequence Models and Autoregressive Neural Vocoders" by Wen-Chin Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the systems developed for the Voice Conversion Challenge 2020 (VCC2020), which suggests that datasets are involved, particularly for training and evaluation purposes.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Task 1: VTN with synthetic parallel data)** and **section 3 (Task 2: CycleVAE and WaveNet vocoder)**, as these sections detail the systems and methodologies used. In these sections, the authors mention specific datasets used for training and evaluation.

In **section 2.3 (Implementation)**, the authors state that they used the **CMU ARCTIC dataset** for generating synthetic speech. This dataset is crucial for their task as it provides the necessary speech data for training their TTS systems.

Additionally, in **section 3.3 (Training and conversion process)**, the authors mention using the **VCTK corpus**, which contains speech data from 24 speakers, to train the CycleVAE-based spectral model and WaveNet vocoder. This dataset is also significant for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **CMU ARCTIC dataset**, the citation is:
   > Kominek, J., & Black, A. W. (2004). The CMU ARCTIC speech databases. In Fifth ISCA Workshop on Speech Synthesis.

2. For the **VCTK corpus**, the citation is:
   > Veaux, C., Yamagishi, J., & MacDonald, K. (2017). CSTR VCTK corpus: English multi-speaker corpus for CSTR voice cloning toolkit.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation.

This process ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper, along with their proper citations, which is essential for any further analysis or application of the research findings.
