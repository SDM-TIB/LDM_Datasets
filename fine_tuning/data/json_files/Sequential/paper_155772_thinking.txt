To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Phrase-based Sequence-to-Sequence Learning" by Bailin Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, including any datasets used. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will move on to the introduction.

Next, I will look for any references to datasets in the **experiments** section, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. The experiments section mentions several tasks and datasets, including:

1. **SVO→SOV Translation Task**: This task uses a synthetic dataset generated with a specific synchronous grammar. However, the paper does not provide a formal citation for this dataset since it is generated by the authors.

2. **English-Chinese Translation Dataset**: The authors mention using a subset of the dataset from Li et al. (2021) designed for testing compositional generalization in machine translation. I will need to find the full citation for this dataset.

3. **German-English Translation Dataset**: The paper refers to the TED talks dataset from the IWSLT 2014 DE-EN translation task, which is a well-known dataset in the field. I will also need to find the full citation for this dataset.

4. **Cherokee-English Translation Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as being used for low-resource translation tasks, and it is sourced from Zhang et al. (2020). I will look for the full citation for this dataset as well.

After identifying these datasets, I will consult the **References section** of the paper to retrieve the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **English-Chinese Translation Dataset** from Li et al. (2021), the citation is:
  > Li, Y., Yin, Y., Chen, Y., & Zhang, Y. (2021). On compositional generalization of neural machine translation. In Proceedings of the 59th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 11th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 4767–4780.

- For the **German-English Translation Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cettolo, M., Niehues, J., Stüker, S., Bentivogli, L., & Federico, M. (2014). Report on the 11th IWSLT evaluation campaign. In Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation: Evaluation Campaign, pages 2–17.

- For the **Cherokee-English Translation Dataset** from Zhang et al. (2020), the citation is:
  > Zhang, S., Frey, B., & Bansal, M. (2020). ChrEn: Cherokee-English machine translation for endangered language revitalization. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 577–595.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be documented with its name, description, and full citation to ensure clarity and proper attribution.
