To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-to-end Keyword Spotting using Neural Architecture Search and Quantization" by David Peter, Wolfgang Roth, and Franz Pernkopf, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions conducting experiments on the **Google speech commands dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely central to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section** where the authors discuss various models evaluated on the Google speech commands dataset. This reinforces the importance of this dataset in their experiments.

In the **experimental setup section (Section 3)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. They mention that the dataset consists of **65,000 1-second long audio files** sampled at **16 kHz**, containing utterances of English words grouped into **30 different classes**. They specifically highlight the use of **10 classes** for their experiments, including "Yes", "No", "Up", "Down", "Left", "Right", "On", "Off", "Stop", and "Go", along with an "unknown" class and a "silence" class.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Google speech commands dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **Google speech commands dataset**, the citation is:
  > P. Warden, “Speech Commands: A Dataset for Limited-Vocabulary Speech Recognition,” CoRR, vol. abs/1804.03209, 2018.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details clearly.

The only dataset mentioned in this paper is the **Google speech commands dataset**, which is crucial for the experiments conducted by the authors. 

Now, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
