To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quality-Gated Convolutional LSTM for Enhancing Compressed Video" by Ren Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Preliminary)**, where the authors mention using the **Vid-70 database**. This is a key dataset used in their experiments, and I will take note of its details. The paper states that Vid-70 consists of 70 videos encoded by various standards, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's scope.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors describe their experimental setup and mention that they use the **Vid-70 database** for training and testing their QG-ConvLSTM approach. This confirms that Vid-70 is the primary dataset utilized in their research.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the **Vid-70 database** in the **References section**. The relevant citation is:
> Ren Yang, Mai Xu, Zulin Wang, and Tianyi Li. *Multi-frame quality enhancement for compressed video*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the **Vid-70 database** is the only dataset referenced in this research.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the study.
