To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Interpretable Systematic Review of Machine Learning Models for Predictive Maintenance of Aircraft Engine" by Abdullah Al Hasib et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a "very well-known dataset CMAPSS by NASA," which indicates that there is a specific dataset being utilized.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the CMAPSS dataset in detail. They mention that it consists of several multivariate time series and provides operational parameters that impact engine performance. This section will give me the necessary details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

The authors specify that the CMAPSS dataset is divided into four sets: FD001, FD002, FD003, and FD004, each containing training, testing, and remaining useful life (RUL) data. This information is crucial for understanding how the dataset is organized and how it can be used for predictive maintenance tasks.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the CMAPSS dataset. The citation is typically provided in the references, and it is essential to include it for proper attribution.

The citation for the CMAPSS dataset is:
> NASA Ames Prognostics Center of Excellence. *C-MAPSS Aircraft Engine Simulator Data*. Available at: https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/C-MAPSS-Aircraft-Engine-Simulator-Data/xaut-bemq.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and its citation in a structured format, ensuring that I include all relevant information for clarity and completeness. This will allow for easy reference and understanding of the dataset's significance in the context of the research paper.
