To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Circumventing Outliers of AutoAugment with Knowledge Distillation" by Longhui Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were performed on standard image classification benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail their experimental setup. In this section, they mention using two specific datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, uniformly distributed over 10 classes. It is commonly used for validating learning algorithms.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset also contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, but it is distributed over 100 classes. It serves as a more challenging benchmark for image classification tasks.

The authors provide a brief description of each dataset, confirming their relevance to the experiments conducted.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

This citation is applicable to both datasets as they are part of the same foundational work.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will prepare the information for any further processing or review.
