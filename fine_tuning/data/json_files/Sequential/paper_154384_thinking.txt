To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparison of Attention-based Deep Learning Models for EEG Classification" by Giulia Cisotto et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their models on different EEG datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Research Methodologies and Evaluation)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. Within this section, the authors explicitly mention three EEG datasets provided by the Temple University Hospital of Philadelphia:

1. **TUH EEG Abnormal**: This dataset includes recordings with annotations of patients' clinical history and EEG abnormalities. The authors note that it contains 1472 positive samples (abnormalities) and 1521 negative samples (normal EEG).

2. **TUH EEG Artifact**: This dataset consists of normal EEG signals and signals affected by various types of artifacts. The authors report 1259 positive samples (artifacts) and 1940 negative samples (clean EEG).

3. **TUH EEG Seizure**: This dataset contains EEG recordings affected by different types of seizures, with 4240 samples of focal non-specific seizures (negative class) and 1717 samples of generalized non-specific seizures (positive class).

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **TUH EEG Seizure**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
