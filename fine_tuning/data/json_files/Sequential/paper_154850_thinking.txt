To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Short-Term Load Forecasting for Smart Home Appliances with Sequence to Sequence Learning" by Mina Razghandi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors used a "real dataset collected from four residential buildings," which suggests that a specific dataset is being referenced.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, there is a **Table I** that lists the monitored appliances across different buildings, but it does not provide a dataset name. However, in the **evaluation study** section, the authors mention using a publicly available dataset called **GreenD**.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the GreenD dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **GreenD Dataset**: 
  > A. Monacchi, D. Egarter, W. Elmenreich, S. D’Alessandro, and A. M. Tonello. "GREEND: an energy consumption dataset of households in Italy and Austria." In Proceedings of SmartGridComm, 2014, pp. 511–516.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **GreenD Dataset**: This dataset contains appliance-level energy consumption data collected from eight different households, including apartments and detached houses, from December 2013 to October 2014 in Austria and Italy. It includes data for an average of nine appliances per household at a frequency of 1Hz.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset details along with the necessary citations for proper attribution.
