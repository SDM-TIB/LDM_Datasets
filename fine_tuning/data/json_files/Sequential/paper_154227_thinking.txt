To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Grid Tagging Scheme for Aspect-oriented Fine-grained Opinion Extraction" by Zhen Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for validation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Metrics)**, where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant statistics provided.

In this paper, the authors mention four datasets used for aspect-oriented opinion pair extraction, which are:

1. **14res**: This dataset is from the restaurant domain and includes a total of 1,259 training sentences, 315 development sentences, and 493 test sentences. It contains annotations for aspect terms, opinion terms, opinion pairs, and opinion triplets.

2. **14lap**: This dataset is from the laptop domain, with 899 training sentences, 225 development sentences, and 332 test sentences. Similar to the 14res dataset, it includes annotations for aspect terms, opinion terms, opinion pairs, and opinion triplets.

3. **15res**: Another dataset from the restaurant domain, consisting of 603 training sentences, 151 development sentences, and 325 test sentences, with the same types of annotations.

4. **16res**: This dataset is also from the restaurant domain, containing 863 training sentences, 216 development sentences, and 328 test sentences, with annotations for aspect terms, opinion terms, opinion pairs, and opinion triplets.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The authors reference the original sources of the datasets, which are based on the SemEval Challenges. The citations for these datasets are:

- For **14res** and **15res** datasets, the citation is:

- For **14lap** dataset, the citation is:

- For **16res** dataset, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
