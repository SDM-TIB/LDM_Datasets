To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepSwarm: Optimising Convolutional Neural Networks using Swarm Intelligence" by Edvinas Byla and Wei Pang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the method was evaluated on three datasets: **MNIST**, **Fashion-MNIST**, and **CIFAR-10**. This is a strong indication that these datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In Section 4, they state that they conducted experiments on three different datasets: 

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits.
2. **Fashion-MNIST**: A dataset designed as a drop-in replacement for MNIST, consisting of fashion items.
3. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.

The authors also reference the original sources for these datasets, which is crucial for providing full citations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the complete citations for each dataset:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y. "The MNIST database of handwritten digits." http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ (1998).

- For **Fashion-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Xiao, H., Rasul, K., and Vollgraf, R. "Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms." arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747 (2017).

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Nair, V., and Hinton, G. "The CIFAR-10 dataset." http://www.cs.toronto.edu/kriz/cifar.html (2014).

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or integration into a database.
