To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Extremely Compact RNNs for Video Recognition with Fully Decomposed Hierarchical Tucker Structure" by Miao Yin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the experimental results are based on "several popular video recognition datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any explicit mentions of datasets. Here, the authors reference the **UCF11 dataset** and the **Youtube Celebrities Face dataset**, which are likely the datasets used for their experiments.

I will then navigate to the **experiments section** to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, the authors provide specific information about the datasets:

1. **UCF11 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,600 video clips across 11 action classes, with each class containing at least 4 action clips. The authors mention that the dataset is used for training and evaluation, and they provide details about the preprocessing steps.

2. **Youtube Celebrities Face Dataset**: This dataset contains 1,910 video clips from 47 subjects. The authors also describe the preprocessing steps taken for this dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **UCF11 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jingen Liu, Jiebo Luo, and Mubarak Shah. *Recognizing realistic actions from videos “in the wild”*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 1996–2003, 2009.

- For the **Youtube Celebrities Face dataset**, the citation is:
  > Minyoung Kim, Sanjiv Kumar, Vladimir Pavlovic, and Henry Rowley. *Face tracking and recognition with visual constraints in real-world videos*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 1–8, 2008.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
