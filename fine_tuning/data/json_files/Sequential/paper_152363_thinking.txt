To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Larger-Context Language Modelling with Recurrent Neural Network" by Tian Wang and Kyunghyun Cho, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their model on three corpora: **IMDB, BBC, and Penn TreeBank**. This suggests that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** where the authors provide more details about the datasets. In **section 5.2 (Datasets)**, they describe the three datasets used for evaluation:

1. **IMDB Movie Reviews**: This dataset consists of 75,000 training reviews and 25,000 test reviews, with a total of 21 million words. It is prepared by Maas et al. (2011).

2. **BBC Corpus**: This dataset contains news articles with 152,987 sentences and 3 million words. It is prepared by Greene & Cunningham (2006).

3. **Penn TreeBank**: This dataset includes 42,068 sentences and 888,000 words. The authors preprocess this corpus according to Mikolov et al. (2011).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **IMDB Movie Review Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Maas, Andrew L., Daly, Raymond E., Pham, Peter T., Huang, Dan, Ng, Andrew Y., and Potts, Christopher. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies-Volume 1, pp. 142–150. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2011.

- For the **BBC Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Greene, Derek, and Cunningham, Pádraig. *Practical solutions to the problem of diagonal dominance in kernel document clustering*. In Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), pp. 377–384. ACM Press, 2006.

- For the **Penn TreeBank**, the citation is:
  > Mikolov, Tomas, Karaﬁ´at, Martin, Burget, Lukas, Cernock`y, Jan, and Khudanpur, Sanjeev. *Recurrent neural network based language model*. In INTERSPEECH 2010, 11th Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association, pp. 1045–1048, 2010.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets and their citations for inclusion in the final output.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
