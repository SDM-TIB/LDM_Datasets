To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Electronics and Sensor Subsystem Design for Daedalus 2 on REXUS 29: An Autorotation Probe for Sub-Orbital Re-Entry" by Jan M. Wolf et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the Daedalus 2 mission and its objectives, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Electronics)** and **section 5 (Pre-Flight Evaluation)**, as these sections may contain information about the data collected during experiments or tests. In section 3, the authors discuss various sensors and their configurations, but they do not specify any datasets. However, in section 5, they mention performing tests and collecting data, which could imply the existence of datasets.

I will also check the **References section** for any cited works that may contain datasets relevant to the Daedalus 2 project. The references include works related to the Daedalus 1 project, which may provide insights into datasets used in previous experiments.

After reviewing the paper, I find that there are no specific datasets explicitly named or described in the text. However, the authors refer to data collected from the Spaceseeds during their descent and recovery, which could be considered a dataset in a broader sense.

Since no formal datasets are provided, I will note that the data collected during the Daedalus 2 mission includes telemetry data from the Spaceseeds, which consists of measurements from various sensors (e.g., accelerometers, barometers, GNSS modules) during the flight.

Now, I will compile the relevant information and citations for any referenced works that may provide context or additional datasets related to the Daedalus 2 project:

1. **Daedalus 1 Project**: The authors reference the previous Daedalus 1 project, which may have datasets related to autorotation and descent mechanisms. The citation for this project is:
   > Clemens Riegler et al. “PROJECT DAEDALUS, ROTOR CONTROLLED DESCENT AND LANDING ON REXUS23”. In: 23rd ESA PAC. June 2019. URL: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337819783_PROJECT_DAEDALUS_ROTOR_CONTROLLED_DESCENT_AND_LANDING_ON_REXUS23.

2. **RODOS Real-Time Kernel**: The authors mention the RODOS real-time operating system, which may have associated datasets or performance metrics. The citation is:
   > Sergio Montenegro and Frank Dannemann. “RODOS - real time kernel design for dependability”. In: DASIA 2009 - DAta Systems in Aerospace 669 (2009), p. 66.

Since the paper does not provide explicit datasets, I will summarize the findings and note the absence of formal datasets while providing the relevant citations for context. This will ensure that any future references to datasets related to the Daedalus 2 project are properly attributed.
