To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recurrent Highway Networks" by Julian Georg Zilly et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted several language modeling experiments, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using the **Penn Treebank dataset** for word-level language modeling and the **Wikipedia datasets** (specifically **text8** and **enwik8**) for character prediction tasks. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

In section 5.2.1, the authors provide details about the **Penn Treebank dataset**, stating it is a standard benchmark in language modeling. They also mention the preprocessing steps taken, which further confirms its use in their experiments.

In section 5.2.2, the authors describe the **Wikipedia datasets** (text8 and enwik8), detailing how they were split into training, validation, and test sets. This section provides additional context about the datasets used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Penn Treebank Dataset**:
   > Marcus, Mitchell P., Marcinkiewicz, Mary Ann, and Santorini, Beatrice. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Comput. Linguist., 19(2):313â€“330, June 1993.

2. **Text8 Dataset**:
   > Hutter, Martin. *The human knowledge compression contest*. http://prize.hutter1.net/, 2012.

3. **Enwik8 Dataset**:
   > Hutter, Martin. *The human knowledge compression contest*. http://prize.hutter1.net/, 2012.

Both text8 and enwik8 datasets are derived from the same source, so they share the same citation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets from the paper along with their proper references.
