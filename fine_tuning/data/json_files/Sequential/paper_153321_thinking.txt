To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Critical Analysis of Biased Parsers in Unsupervised Parsing" by Chris Dyer, Gábor Melis, and Phil Blunsom, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often discusses prior work and may reference datasets used in those studies.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In this paper, the authors describe their methodology and results, which may include specific datasets used for evaluation. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize results, as they often indicate the datasets involved.

In the **experimental details section**, the authors mention training their models on the **Penn Treebank (PTB)** language modeling dataset. This is a crucial dataset for their experiments, and I will note its details.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. For the **Penn Treebank**, the citation is:
> Marcus, M. P., Marcinkiewicz, M. A., & Santorini, B. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313–330.

Since the paper does not mention any additional datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **Penn Treebank** dataset.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are included and accurately represented.
