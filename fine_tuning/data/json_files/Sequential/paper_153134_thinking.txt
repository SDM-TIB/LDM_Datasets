To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Video Generation on Complex Datasets" by Aidan Clark et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on the **Kinetics-600 dataset** and the **UCF-101 dataset**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets in detail. In this paper, the **Background** section provides a description of the **Kinetics-600 dataset**, stating that it consists of 600 classes with at least 600 videos per class, totaling around 500,000 videos. This dataset is used for human action recognition and is noted for its diversity and complexity.

The paper also mentions the **UCF-101 dataset** in the **Experiments and Analysis** section, describing it as a smaller dataset with 13,320 videos across 101 classes. This dataset is used for video synthesis and prediction tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Kinetics-600 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Joao Carreira and Andrew Zisserman. *Quo vadis, action recognition? A new model and the Kinetics dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2017.

2. For the **UCF-101 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Khurram Soomro, Amir Roshan Zamir, and Mubarak Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.
