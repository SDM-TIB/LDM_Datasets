To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structured Sentiment Analysis as Transition-based Dependency Parsing" by Daniel Fernández-González, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the model is evaluated on "five standard benchmarks in four languages," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically subsection A titled "Datasets." Here, the author lists the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **NoReCFine**: This dataset is described as the largest, consisting of multi-domain professional reviews in Norwegian.
2. **MultiBEU**: This dataset collects hotel reviews in Basque.
3. **MultiBCA**: This dataset collects hotel reviews in Catalan.
4. **MPQA**: This dataset is composed of news wire text in English.
5. **DSUnis**: This dataset is derived from reviews of online universities and e-commerce in English.

The paper also mentions that results are reported on two versions of the MPQA dataset, indicating that the original version and an extension (MPQAv2) are both utilized.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately for future reference or analysis.
