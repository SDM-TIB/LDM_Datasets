To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Actions and Control of Focus of Attention with a Log-Polar-like Sensor" by Robin Göransson and Volker Krueger, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of log-polar-like image data and mentions evaluating the method on Atari games, which suggests that datasets related to these games may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the specific Atari games used for evaluation. They mention that they trained their models on three Atari games: **Pong**, **Breakout**, and **Beam Rider**. This indicates that these games serve as the datasets for their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets used. The Atari games are part of the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**, which is a well-known benchmark for reinforcement learning. The citation for the ALE is:

- **Arcade Learning Environment**:
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Munos, R. (2012). The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253–279.

Since the paper does not provide separate datasets for each game but rather uses the ALE as a platform to evaluate the performance of their models on these games, I will note that the dataset is the ALE itself, which encompasses the three games mentioned.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment, which serves as the dataset for the experiments conducted in this paper.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for further processing or review.
