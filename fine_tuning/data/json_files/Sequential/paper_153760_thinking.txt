To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sampled Training and Node Inheritance for Fast Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search" by Haoyu Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed algorithm on "widely used datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section V (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention three benchmark datasets:

1. **CIFAR10**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images across 10 categories, with each image having a dimension of 32 Ã— 32 pixels.

2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10, this dataset also contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, but it is a 100-category classification problem.

3. **SVHN (Street View House Numbers)**: This dataset contains 630,420 RGB color images of digits, with 73,257 samples used for training, 26,032 for validation, and the rest for testing.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR10 and CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. "Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images." Technical Report, 2009.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Y. Netzer, T. Wang, A. Coates, A. Bissacco, B. Wu, and A. Y. Ng. "Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning." 2011.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
