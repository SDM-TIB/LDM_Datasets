To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Open-domain Keyphrase Generation" by Lam Thanh Do et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method using **eight benchmark datasets from different domains**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically section 3.1, where the authors list the datasets used for testing. They mention the following datasets:

1. **SemEval**: This dataset is used for keyphrase extraction and is categorized as scientific. The authors provide the number of valid/test documents (144/100) and additional statistics such as the average number of keyphrases per document and the percentage of absent keyphrases.

2. **Inspec**: Another scientific dataset with 1500 valid documents and 500 test documents. It has similar statistics regarding keyphrases.

3. **NUS**: This dataset also falls under the scientific category, with 50 valid documents and 161 test documents.

4. **Krapivin**: This dataset contains 1844 valid documents and 460 test documents, categorized as scientific.

5. **StackExchange**: A technical dataset with 16000 valid and test documents.

6. **DUC-2001**: This dataset is categorized as news, with 50 valid documents and 268 test documents.

7. **KPTimes**: Another news dataset with 10000 valid documents and 20000 test documents.

8. **OpenKP**: This dataset has 6616 valid documents and 6614 test documents, also categorized as news.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
