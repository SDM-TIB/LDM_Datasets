To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multistep Speed Prediction on Traffic Networks: A Graph Convolutional Sequence-to-Sequence Learning Approach with Attention Mechanism" by Zhengchao Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted numerical tests using a real-world dataset, which suggests that there is a dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Numerical Examples)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that the data was collected from A-map, a smartphone-based navigation application, and that the dataset pertains to the 2nd ring road in Beijing.

The authors provide specific details about the dataset:
- The dataset consists of traffic speed data collected from users of A-map.
- The data covers the entire 2nd ring road, which is 33 km long and divided into 163 road segments.
- The speed data is averaged over 5-minute intervals, and the dataset spans from October 1, 2016, to November 30, 2016.
- The training set includes data from October 1 to November 20, while the testing set includes data from November 21 to November 27.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset in the **References section**. The authors acknowledge A-map for providing the data, so I will note that as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the dataset is:
> A-map. (2018). A smartphone-based navigation application with the most active users in China. Retrieved from https://www.amap.com/

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information, including its name, description, and citation, ensuring that I have captured all relevant details for downstream processing.

The dataset entry will include:
- **Dataset Name**: A-map Traffic Speed Dataset
- **Description**: Traffic speed data collected from users of A-map, covering the 2nd ring road in Beijing, divided into 163 road segments, with 5-minute average speed data from October 1, 2016, to November 30, 2016.
- **Citation**: A-map. (2018). A smartphone-based navigation application with the most active users in China. Retrieved from https://www.amap.com/

With this structured approach, I will ensure that I have accurately extracted and documented the dataset from the research paper.
