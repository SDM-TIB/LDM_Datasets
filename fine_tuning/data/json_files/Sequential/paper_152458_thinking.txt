To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards a Deep Unified Framework for Nuclear Reactor Perturbation Analysis" by Fabio De Sousa Ribeiro et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions the use of a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for analyzing perturbations in nuclear reactors, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these analyses.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section III (The Examined Scenarios)** and **section V (Experimental Study)**. In these sections, the authors describe various scenarios and experiments, which often include details about the datasets used.

In **section III**, the authors discuss different perturbation scenarios, including "Absorber of Variable Strength" and "Propagating Perturbation," and mention the use of CORE-SIM to model induced neutron noise. They also describe the data preprocessing steps, indicating that they generated datasets with specific characteristics, such as the number of instances and the types of perturbations.

In **section V**, the authors provide detailed results of their experiments, including the datasets used for training, validation, and testing. They mention the number of samples and the conditions under which the data was collected, which is crucial for understanding the datasets.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or tools mentioned, such as CORE-SIM and Simulate-3K (S3K), which are used to generate the datasets. 

For the datasets identified, I will ensure to document the following details:
1. **Dataset Name**: The name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of what the dataset contains and its purpose.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete citation for the dataset or the tool used to generate it.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the necessary details for clarity and proper attribution.

After completing this process, I will have a structured list of datasets extracted from the paper, ready for further analysis or integration into a larger dataset repository.
