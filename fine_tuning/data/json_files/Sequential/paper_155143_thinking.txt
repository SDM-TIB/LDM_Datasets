To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transformer Based Bengali Chatbot Using General Knowledge Dataset" by Abu Kaisar Mohammad Masum et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the research is based on a **Bengali general knowledge Question Answer (QA) dataset**, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of the dataset in the **Methodology section**. Here, the authors mention that the dataset contains **two thousand questions and answers** related to Bangladesh and international affairs. They also specify that the dataset has three attributes, but only two (questions and answers) are used for the chatbot model.

In the **Dataset properties subsection**, the authors provide specific details about the dataset, including:
- Number of questions: 3738
- Number of question tokens: 2355
- Maximum input length: 15
- Maximum output length: 10
- Total data: 2000

This information confirms the dataset's structure and size.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the Bengali general knowledge QA dataset, as it states that the data was collected from online sources. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is not formally cited in the paper.

Since the dataset is crucial for the research, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Bengali General Knowledge Question Answering Dataset**: This dataset is used for training the chatbot and contains 2000 question-answer pairs related to general knowledge about Bangladesh and international affairs. The dataset is not formally cited in the paper.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I clearly indicate the lack of a formal citation for the dataset.
