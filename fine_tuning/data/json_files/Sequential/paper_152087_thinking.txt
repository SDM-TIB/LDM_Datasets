To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepTrend: A Deep Hierarchical Neural Network for Traffic Flow Prediction" by Xingyuan Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the experiments are based on traffic flow data, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), where the authors discuss the data sources and preprocessing. Here, they specify that the experimental data of traffic flow is obtained from the **Caltrans Performance Measurement Systems (PeMS)**, which collects data from 3941 stations every 5 minutes across California. This indicates that PeMS is a significant dataset used in their research.

I will also note that the authors mention selecting 1397 stations for analysis, which implies that they are working with a subset of the original dataset. However, the primary dataset remains the PeMS data.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** for the Caltrans Performance Measurement Systems (PeMS) in the references section. The citation is as follows:
> Caltrans, performance measurement system (PeMS). [Online]. Available: http://pems.dot.ca.gov

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the only dataset used in this research is the PeMS dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that the dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
