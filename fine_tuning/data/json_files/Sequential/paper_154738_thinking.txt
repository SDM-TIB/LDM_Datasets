To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepQAMVS: Query-Aware Hierarchical Pointer Networks for Multi-Video Summarization" by Assma Boughoula et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors achieve state-of-the-art results on the **MVS1K dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely central to their research.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe their experiments in detail. Here, they mention the **MVS1K dataset** again, providing specific details about its composition. The dataset consists of 1000 videos associated with 10 queries, along with web images, video titles, and descriptions. This section confirms that MVS1K is indeed the primary dataset used for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MVS1K dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:
> Ji, Zhong, Ma, Yaru, Pang, Yanwei, and Li, Xuelong. "Query-aware sparse coding for web multi-video summarization." *Information Sciences*, 2019.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **MVS1K Dataset**: This dataset is a collection of 1000 videos on 10 different queries, complete with associated web images, video titles, and descriptions. It serves as the primary dataset for evaluating the proposed DeepQAMVS model.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that the citation is included for proper attribution.
