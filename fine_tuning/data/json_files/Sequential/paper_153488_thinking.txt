To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-Time Emotion Recognition via Attention Gated Hierarchical Memory Network" by Wenxiang Jiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two emotion conversation datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they describe two datasets:

1. **IEMOCAP**: The IEMOCAP dataset is described as containing the acts of 10 speakers in a dyadic conversation format, providing text, audio, and video features. The authors specify that they use the first four sessions for training and the last one for testing, focusing on six emotion classes.

2. **MELD**: The MELD dataset is noted as an extended version of the EmotionLines dataset, derived from the Friends TV series. It includes multiple speakers and is split into training, validation, and testing sets, with each utterance labeled by one of seven emotion types.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. Here are the full citations for the datasets:

- For **IEMOCAP**, the citation is:
  > Busso, C., Bulut, M., Lee, C., Kazemzadeh, A., Mower, E., Kim, S., Chang, J. N., Lee, S., & Narayanan, S. (2008). IEMOCAP: Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture Database. *Language Resources and Evaluation*, 42(4), 335–359.

- For **MELD**, the citation is:
  > Poria, S., Hazarika, D., Majumder, N., Naik, G., Cambria, E., & Mihalcea, R. (2019). MELD: A Multimodal Multi-Party Dataset for Emotion Recognition in Conversations. In *Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)*, 527–536.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the research paper.
