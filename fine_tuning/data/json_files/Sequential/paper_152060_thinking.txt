To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Direct Load Control of Thermostatically Controlled Loads Based on Sparse Observations Using Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Frederik Ruelens et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of deep learning techniques for demand response applications, which suggests that datasets related to energy consumption or temperature might be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their simulation experiments. In this section, they mention two specific experiments: one involving a **heat pump** and the other involving an **electric water heater**. I will look for any datasets or data sources referenced in these experiments.

In the **heat pump experiment**, the authors refer to using a model that simulates temperature dynamics based on outside temperatures sourced from a specific dataset. They mention that the outside temperatures were obtained from the KMI Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium, which is a key dataset for this experiment.

In the **electric water heater experiment**, the authors describe the use of a non-linear stratified model to simulate temperature gradients and tap water profiles. They reference a previous paper that used temperature sensors, but for this experiment, they assume no sensors are available. However, they do not specify a new dataset for this experiment, which indicates that they might be using simulated data based on the model described.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **KMI Royal Meteorological Institute dataset**, the citation is:
   > KMI - Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium. "Ambient Temperatures." [Online]. Available: https://github.com/open-ideas/IDEAS/blob/master/IDEAS/Inputs/Uccle.TMY. Accessed: January 21, 2017.

Since the paper does not provide a specific dataset citation for the electric water heater experiment, I will note that it relies on simulated data rather than a publicly available dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the KMI dataset, and prepare them for structured output.
