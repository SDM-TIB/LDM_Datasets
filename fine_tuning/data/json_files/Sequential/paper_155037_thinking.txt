To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning with Kernel Flow Regularization for Time Series Forecasting" by Mahdy Shirdel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on various time series datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention five datasets:

1. **PJM power load**: This dataset includes hourly power load data from 28 regional zones in the northeastern USA over three years. The authors note that they added cyclical time features to this dataset.

2. **Solar data**: This dataset consists of 10-minute interval data from 137 photovoltaic plants in Alabama for the year 2006.

3. **Electricity data**: This dataset contains 15-minute kWh data from 321 clients collected between 2012 and 2014.

4. **Traffic data**: This dataset represents hourly traffic occupancy data from the Bay Area, California, spanning 48 months.

5. **Exchange-rate data**: This dataset includes daily exchange rates for eight countries from 1990 to 2006.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The authors reference the datasets as follows:

- For the **PJM power load dataset**, the citation is:
  > PJM website. [Online]. Available: http://www.pjm.com

- For the **Solar data**, **Electricity data**, and **Traffic data**, the citation is:
  > Lai, G., Chang, W.-C., Yang, Y., & Liu, H. (2018). Modeling long-and short-term temporal patterns with deep neural networks. In The 41st International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research & Development in Information Retrieval (pp. 95–104).

- For the **Exchange-rate data**, the citation is also:
  > Lai, G., Chang, W.-C., Yang, Y., & Liu, H. (2018). Modeling long-and short-term temporal patterns with deep neural networks. In The 41st International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research & Development in Information Retrieval (pp. 95–104).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be described with its name, a brief description, and the corresponding citation.
