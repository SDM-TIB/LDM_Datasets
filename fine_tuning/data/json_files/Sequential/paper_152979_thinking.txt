To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Neural Architecture Search with Deep Graph Bayesian Optimization" by Lizheng Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using five datasets for their experiments in section 4.2. I will list these datasets and gather details about their usage in the experiments.

The datasets mentioned are:
1. **Indoor Location**: This dataset is referenced in the context of regression problems for MLPs.
2. **Slice Localisation**: Another dataset used for regression tasks with MLPs.
3. **Cifar10**: A well-known dataset used for classification tasks with CNNs.
4. **MNIST**: A classic dataset for handwritten digit classification, also used for CNN tasks.
5. **Fashion MNIST**: A dataset similar to MNIST but with clothing items, used for classification tasks.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:
- **Indoor Location**:

- **Cifar10**: 
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

- **MNIST**: 
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- **Fashion MNIST**: 
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations to ensure that they are properly documented and ready for any further processing or review.
