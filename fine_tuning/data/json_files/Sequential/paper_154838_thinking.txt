To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Automated Agriculture Commodity Price Prediction System with Machine Learning Techniques" by Zhiyuan Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the research involves large historical datasets related to agricultural commodity prices, which suggests that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. They mention that the datasets are extracted from the FAMA official government website, which contains weekly data analysis reports from 2007 to 2020. This section provides crucial details about the datasets, including the time range and the types of data included.

The authors specify that two series of experiments were conducted:
1. A time-series dataset covering 11 years (December 2008 to March 2019).
2. A multivariable dataset that includes additional features such as Temperature, Humidity, Precipitation, and Crude Oil Price.

I will also look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, such as Table 1, which presents price statistics for selected commodities (Chicken, Chili, Tomato). This table provides mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation values for the datasets, confirming their relevance.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper mentions that the datasets are sourced from the FAMA website, so I will need to provide the citation for this source. The citation for the FAMA website is as follows:
> FAMA (Federal Agricultural Marketing Authority). *Weekly Data Analysis Reports*. Available at: https://sdvi.fama.gov.my/analisahargamingguan/DownloadPassword.asp.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the FAMA website as the source of the datasets.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
