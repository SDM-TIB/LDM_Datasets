To extract datasets from the research paper titled "In Nomine Function: Naming Functions in Stripped Binaries with Neural Networks" by Fiorella Artuso et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a new dataset, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (The UbuntuDataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of nearly 9 million functions extracted from 22,040 distinct software packages. This section provides crucial information about the dataset's composition and its intended use.

In this section, I will note the following details:
- **Dataset Name**: UbuntuDataset
- **Description**: A dataset composed of real-world binaries spanning various application fields, containing 8.8 million functions from 22,000 distinct software packages.
- **Availability**: The dataset is made available online for testing and evaluation.

I will also check the **References section** for any citations related to the dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the UbuntuDataset itself, but they reference other works that may have used similar datasets or methodologies.

The relevant citation for the dataset construction process is:
> UbuntuDataset (Artuso et al., 2023). Available at: https://github.com/gadiluna/in_nomine_function.

Now, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
