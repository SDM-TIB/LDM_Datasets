To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Adaptive Dual-level Reinforcement Learning Approach for Optimal Trade Execution" by Soohan Kimb et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 5.1.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they used millisecond trade and limit order book (LOB) tick data from the Korea Exchange (KRX) for four specific companies: Samsung Electronics (SE), SK Hynix (SH), Kia Corporation (KC), and POSCO Holdings Inc (PH). The authors specify the time frame for the data, which is from January 1st, 2021, to December 31st, 2021, and explain how they divided the data into training and test sets.

The details provided in this section are crucial for documenting the datasets. I will note the following information for each dataset:

1. **Dataset Name**: KRX Trade and LOB Data
   - **Description**: Millisecond trade and limit order book tick data for four companies.
   - **Companies**: Samsung Electronics (SE), SK Hynix (SH), Kia Corporation (KC), POSCO Holdings Inc (PH).
   - **Time Frame**: January 1st, 2021 to December 31st, 2021.
   - **Training/Test Split**: January 1st to September 30th for training, October 1st to December 31st for testing.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citation for the datasets. However, since the datasets are proprietary data from the Korea Exchange, they may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note the source as follows:

- **Source**: Korea Exchange (KRX), proprietary millisecond trade and limit order book data.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, time frame, and source. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive record of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
