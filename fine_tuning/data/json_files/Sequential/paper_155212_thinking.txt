To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spinning Language Models: Risks of Propaganda-As-A-Service and Countermeasures" by Eugene Bagdasaryan and Vitaly Shmatikov, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the concept of model spinning and its implications, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in the context of their experiments:

1. **CC-News Dataset**: This dataset is used for language generation tasks and contains 708,241 articles. The authors specify that they take 95% for training and 5% for testing.

2. **XSum Dataset**: This dataset is used for summarization tasks and consists of 204,045 training articles and 11,332 test articles from BBC.

3. **CNN/DailyMail Dataset**: This dataset contains 287,113 training articles and 11,490 test articles, used for summarization tasks.

4. **SAMSum Dataset**: This dataset has 14,372 training entries and 818 test entries, used for dialog summarization.

5. **BIGPATENT Dataset**: This dataset focuses on American patents and includes 174,134 training articles and 9,675 test articles.

6. **Newsroom Dataset**: This large dataset contains 995,041 training inputs and 108,862 test inputs from 38 news publishers.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations:

- **CC-News Dataset**:
  > Mackenzie, J., Benham, R., Petri, M., Trippas, J. S., Culpepper, J. S. (2020). *CC-News-En: A large English news corpus*. In CIKM.

- **XSum Dataset**:
  > Narayan, S., Cohen, S. B., & Lapata, M. (2018). *Donâ€™t give me the details, just the summary! Topic-aware convolutional neural networks for extreme summarization*. In EMNLP.

- **CNN/DailyMail Dataset**:
  > Hermann, K. M., Kocisky, T., Grefenstette, E., Espeholt, L., Kay, W., Suleyman, M., & Blunsom, P. (2015). *Teaching machines to read and comprehend*. In NIPS.

- **SAMSum Dataset**:
  > Gliwa, B., Mochol, I., Biesek, M., & Wawer, A. (2019). *SAMSum corpus: A human-annotated dialogue dataset for abstractive summarization*. Workshop at EMNLP.

- **BIGPATENT Dataset**:
  > Sharma, E., Li, C., & Wang, L. (2019). *BIGPATENT: A large-scale dataset for abstractive and coherent summarization*. In ACL.

- **Newsroom Dataset**:
  > Grusky, M., Naaman, M., & Artzi, Y. (2018). *Newsroom: A dataset of 1.3 million summaries with diverse extractive strategies*. In NAACL.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations for future use or verification.
