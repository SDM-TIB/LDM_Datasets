To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MAMI: Multi-Attentional Mutual-Information for Long Sequence Neuron Captioning" by Alfirsa Damasyifa Fauzulhaq et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not detail specific datasets. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Multi-Attentional Neuron Labeling)**, particularly **subsection 2.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they state that they utilized the **Places365 dataset** from Milannotations and describe three variants of it: AlexNet, ResNet-152, and BigGAN. This section provides key characteristics of each dataset, which is crucial for understanding their application in the study.

I will note the specific details provided for each dataset:
1. **AlexNet**: Contains 1,376 samples with a maximum sequence length of 21.
2. **ResNet-152**: Contains 3,904 samples with a maximum sequence length of 47.
3. **BigGAN**: Contains 4,992 samples with a maximum sequence length of 39.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the Places365 dataset or its variants. Therefore, I will look for the original source of the Places365 dataset to ensure accurate citation.

The citation for the **Places365 dataset** is:
> Zhou, B., & Torralba, A. (2017). Places: A 10 million Image Database for Scene Recognition. *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*, 40(6), 1452-1464. doi:10.1109/TPAMI.2017.2723009.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the Places365 dataset, which encompasses the three variants mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all relevant information is captured accurately.
