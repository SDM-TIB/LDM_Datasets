To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scalable Classifier-Agnostic Channel Selection for Multivariate Time Series Classification" by Bhaskar Dhariyal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **UEA MTSC benchmark**, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest. I will note this down as a potential dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss various applications of multivariate time series data. They mention specific datasets like the **Heartbeat dataset** from the UEA MTSC benchmark, which I will document as it is explicitly named.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they worked with a subset of **26 datasets** from the UEA MTSC benchmark, which includes various multivariate time series data. I will need to extract the names of these datasets and any relevant details provided.

I will also look for any **figures or tables** that might summarize the datasets used, as these often contain concise information about dataset characteristics, such as the number of channels, classes, and other relevant metrics.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. For example, the UEA MTSC benchmark is cited as:
> Bagnall, A., Lines, J., Bostrom, A., Large, J., & Keogh, E. (2017). The great time series classification bake off: a review and experimental evaluation of recent algorithmic advances. *Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery*, 31(3), 606-660.

For the **Heartbeat dataset**, I will look for its specific citation, which may be included in the references or can be found through a search for the dataset's original publication.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes its name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted datasets are clearly documented and ready for further processing or review.
