To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LSTM Easy-first Dependency Parsing with Pre-trained Word Embeddings and Character-level Word Embeddings in Vietnamese" by Binh Duc Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors achieved certain accuracy scores on the **Vietnamese Dependency Treebank (VnDT)**, indicating that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors reference the **VnDT** multiple times, particularly in the context of their experiments and comparisons with other methods. This reinforces the importance of this dataset in their research.

In the **results section**, the authors provide details about their experiments using the **VnDT**, confirming its role as the primary dataset for their evaluation. They also mention using two pre-trained word embeddings datasets, specifically **skip-gram** and **subword**, which were trained on Vietnamese text. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Vietnamese Dependency Treebank (VnDT)**:
   - The citation for the VnDT is:
     > Nguyen, D. Q., Thi, L. N., Pham, S. B., Nguyen, P. T., & Le Nguyen, M. (2013). *Building a treebank for Vietnamese dependency parsing*. In Computing and Communication Technologies, Research, Innovation, and Vision for the Future (RIVF), 2013 IEEE RIVF International Conference on. IEEE.

2. **Skip-gram** and **Subword** pre-trained word embeddings:
   - The citations for these datasets are:
     > Mikolov, Tomas, et al. (2013). *Distributed representations of words and phrases and their compositionality*. Advances in neural information processing systems.
     > Bojanowski, Piotr, et al. (2016). *Enriching word vectors with subword information*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1607.04606.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
