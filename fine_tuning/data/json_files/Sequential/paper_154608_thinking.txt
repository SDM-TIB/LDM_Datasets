To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Jointly Modeling Heterogeneous Student Behaviors and Interactions Among Multiple Prediction Tasks" by Haobing Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any subsections that detail the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention that they collected digital footprints from 10,000 students over an academic year, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a summary of the dataset statistics in Table 2. This table includes important details such as:

1. **Library Entrance Records**: The dataset contains 867,571 records of students entering the library.
2. **Dormitory Entrance Records**: There are 1,783,595 records of students entering the dormitory.
3. **Demographic Records**: The dataset includes demographic information for 10,000 students.
4. **Courses**: The dataset encompasses 2,482 courses.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets that are referenced. However, in this case, the datasets are derived from the authors' own data collection efforts rather than external datasets, so there may not be formal citations for them.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper itself, as it is essential to attribute the source of the datasets correctly.

The full citation for the paper is:

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring that I include the relevant details such as the number of records and the context in which they were collected. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
