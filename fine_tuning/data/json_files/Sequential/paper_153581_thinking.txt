To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Focusing and Diffusion: Bidirectional Attentive Graph Convolutional Networks for Skeleton-based Action Recognition" by Jialin Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on two public benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Setting)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **NTU RGB+D Dataset**: This dataset is collected using Microsoft Kinect v2 and contains 56,880 video samples across 60 categories of human actions, with annotations for 25 joints. The authors provide details about the dataset's structure and evaluation protocols.

2. **Skeleton-Kinetics Dataset**: This dataset consists of 400 human action classes, with at least 400 video clips for each action. The authors explain how they obtained skeleton data from this dataset using OpenPose and provide details about the evaluation metrics.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **NTU RGB+D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Amir Shahroudy, Jun Liu, Tian-Tsong Ng, and Gang Wang. *NTU RGB+D: A Large Scale Dataset for 3D Human Activity Analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 1010â€“1019, 2016.

- For the **Skeleton-Kinetics Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Will Kay, Joao Carreira, Karen Simonyan, Brian Zhang, Chloe Hillier, Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan, Fabio Viola, Tim Green, Trevor Back, Paul Natsev, et al. *The Kinetics Human Action Video Dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.06950, 2017.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
