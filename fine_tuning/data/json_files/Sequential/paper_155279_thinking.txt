To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RESCOREBERT: Discriminative Speech Recognition Rescoring with BERT" by Liyan Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on multiple datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that they evaluated their approach on four datasets, which include:

1. **LibriSpeech**: This is a well-known public dataset for automatic speech recognition (ASR) that contains audio recordings of read English speech. The authors mention that they used the decoded 100-best hypotheses from the dev and test sets of LibriSpeech.

2. **Internal Datasets**: The authors describe three internal datasets based on a conversational agent. These datasets are categorized as follows:
   - **Info (en)**: This dataset consists of approximately 100 hours of utterances in English for the information domain.
   - **Info (ja)**: This dataset contains around 220 hours of utterances in Japanese for the information domain.
   - **Nav (ja)**: This dataset includes utterances in Japanese for the navigation domain.

In section 3.1, the authors provide additional details about the datasets, including the number of utterances and the context in which they were used. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope and application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citation for **LibriSpeech** is as follows:
- **LibriSpeech**: 
  > Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. *LibriSpeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proc. IEEE ICASSP, 2015, pp. 5206â€“5210.

For the internal datasets, since they are not publicly available, I will note that they are based on de-identified live user interactions with a conversational agent and do not have formal citations.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citation for LibriSpeech and note the internal datasets appropriately.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
