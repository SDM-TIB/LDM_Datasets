To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Mention Detection" by Juntao Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their models on the **CONLL** and **CRAC** datasets, which suggests that these are key datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Data Set)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **CONLL 2012 English Corpus**: This dataset is used for coreference resolution and consists of 2802 documents for training, 342 for development, and 348 for testing. It is noted that this dataset is not ideal for mention detection as it only annotates mentions involved in coreference chains.

2. **CRAC 2018 Corpus**: This dataset is derived from the ARRAU corpus and is more suitable for studying mention detection as it includes all mentions. The authors specify that they used the RST portion of the corpus, which consists of news texts.

3. **GENIA Corpus**: This corpus is used for nested named entity recognition and is mentioned in the context of evaluating their models. The authors refer to GENIA v3.0.2 and discuss its preprocessing.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **CONLL 2012 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pradhan, S., Moschitti, A., Xue, N., Uryupina, O., and Zhang, Y. (2012). CoNLL-2012 shared task: Modeling multilingual unrestricted coreference in OntoNotes. In Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL 2012), Jeju, Korea.

- For the **CRAC dataset**, the citation is:
  > Poesio, M., Grishina, Y., Kolhatkar, V., Moosavi, N., Roesiger, I., Roussel, A., Simonjetz, F., Uma, A., Uryupina, O., Yu, J., and Zinsmeister, H. (2018). Anaphora resolution with the ARRAU corpus. In Proc. of the NAACL Workshop on Computational Models of Reference, Anaphora and Coreference (CRAC), pages 11–22, New Orleans, June.

- For the **GENIA corpus**, the citation is:
  > Kim, J.-D., Ohta, T., Tateisi, Y., and Tsujii, J. (2003). GENIA corpus: A semantically annotated corpus for bio-text mining. Bioinformatics, 19(suppl 1):i180–i182, 07.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
