To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Progressive DARTS: Bridging the Optimization Gap for NAS in the Wild" by Xin Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on a proxy dataset (CIFAR10) and several target problems (ImageNet classification, COCO detection, and three ReID benchmarks). This suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for architecture search and evaluation. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **CIFAR10**: A dataset with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, distributed over 10 classes. The authors state that they achieve state-of-the-art performance on this dataset.

2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes, containing 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The authors also mention that they perform architecture search on this dataset.

3. **ImageNet**: The authors indicate that they conduct architecture search directly on the ImageNet dataset, which contains 1.28 million training images across 1,000 object categories.

4. **MS-COCO**: The authors evaluate their architectures on the MS-COCO dataset for object detection tasks.

5. **Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and MSMT17**: These datasets are used for person re-identification tasks, and the authors report results on these datasets.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Tech. rep., Citeseer.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., et al. (2015). ImageNet large scale visual recognition challenge. IJCV, 115(3), 211â€“252.

- For **MS-COCO**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T. Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollar, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). Microsoft coco: Common objects in context. In ECCV.

- For **Market-1501**, the citation is:
  > Zheng, L., Shen, L., Tian, L., Wang, S., Wang, J., & Tian, Q. (2015). Scalable person re-identification: A benchmark. In ICCV.

- For **DukeMTMC-reID**, the citation is:
  > Zheng, Z., Zheng, L., & Yang, Y. (2017). Unlabeled samples generated by GAN improve the person re-identification baseline in vitro. In ICCV.

- For **MSMT17**, the citation is:
  > Wei, L., Zhang, S., Gao, W., & Tian, Q. (2018). Person transfer GAN to bridge domain gap for person re-identification. In CVPR.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their corresponding citations from the paper.
