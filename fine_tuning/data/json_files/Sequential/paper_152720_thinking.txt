To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Artificial Neural Networks Condensation: A Strategy to Facilitate Adaptation of Machine Learning in Medical Settings by Reducing Computational Burden" by Dianbo Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract indicates that the authors used the **MIMIC-III database** for their analysis, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods section**, specifically subsection A, where the authors describe the **Intensive Care Unit data**. They provide details about the MIMIC-III database, including the number of patients, the time frame of the data collection, and the criteria for patient selection. This section confirms that the MIMIC-III dataset is indeed the primary dataset used in their study.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MIMIC-III dataset. The authors reference it as follows:

- **MIMIC-III Database**: 
  > Johnson, A. E., Pollard, T. J., Shen, L., Li-wei, H. L., Feng, M., Ghassemi, M., ... & Mark, R. G. (2016). MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database. *Scientific Data*, 3, 160035.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **MIMIC-III Database**: This dataset includes data from 53,423 distinct adult patients admitted to critical care units between 2001 and 2012. The final cohort consists of 33,798 unique patients with a total of 42,276 hospital admissions and ICU stays. It contains various features related to patient vital signs, laboratory tests, and demographics, which are essential for the study's focus on in-hospital mortality prediction.

With this information, I am ready to compile the dataset entry into the required format for further processing or review.
