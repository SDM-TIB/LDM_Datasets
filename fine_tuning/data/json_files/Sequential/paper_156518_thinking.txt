To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stability Analysis of Various Symbolic Rule Extraction Methods from Recurrent Neural Network" by Neisarg Dave et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the study. The abstract mentions that the authors trained RNN models on datasets sampled from **7 Tomita grammars** and **4 Dyck grammars**, which indicates that these are the primary datasets of interest.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions in the **data and models** section, where the authors explain their dataset creation procedure. They provide specific information about the Tomita and Dyck grammars, including the number of samples for training, validation, and testing. 

1. **Tomita Grammars**: The paper states that they used 7 Tomita grammars for benchmarking grammatical inference algorithms. Each grammar has a specific definition, and the authors mention the number of samples used for training (10,000), validation (2,000), and testing (2,000) for each grammar. 

2. **Dyck Grammars**: The authors also describe the Dyck grammars, which are context-free languages characterized by balanced parentheses. They generated 20,000 samples for training and 4,000 samples each for validation and testing for Dyck-2, Dyck-3, Dyck-6, and Dyck-8.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the Tomita grammars and Dyck grammars are not explicitly provided in the references, but I can summarize the information based on the context given in the paper.

- For **Tomita Grammars**, the citation can be attributed to:
  > Masaru Tomita. *Learning of construction of finite automata from examples using hill-climbing*. Technical report, CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIV PITTSBURGH PA DEPT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE, 1982.

- For **Dyck Grammars**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation, it is common to reference foundational works in formal language theory. A general citation could be:
  > A context-free grammar can be defined as S → "(" S ")" | ε, where "(" and ")" are the left and right parentheses, respectively.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets and their citations, ready for further processing or review.
