To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analyzing Neuroimaging Data Through Recurrent Deep Learning Models" by Armin W. Thomas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions the application of the DeepLight framework to a large fMRI dataset from the Human Connectome Project, which indicates that this dataset is significant for the study.

Next, I will look into the **Methods** section, particularly the **fMRI data acquisition & preprocessing** subsection, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they specify that the functional MRI data comes from the Human Connectome Project, specifically mentioning that it includes data from 100 participants performing an N-back task. This is a crucial dataset for the analysis.

I will also check the **Results** section to see if any additional datasets are mentioned or if there are any comparisons made with other datasets. However, the focus seems to remain on the Human Connectome Project dataset.

Finally, I will refer to the **References** section to find the full citation for the Human Connectome Project dataset. The authors reference the original project and its principal investigators, which will help in constructing the citation.

The full citation for the Human Connectome Project dataset is:
> Van Essen, D. C., Smith, S. M., Barch, D. M., Behrens, T. E., Yacoub, E., Ugurbil, K., Consortium, W.-M. H., et al. (2013). The Wu-Minn Human Connectome Project: An overview. *NeuroImage*, 80:62â€“79.

Now, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation for the Human Connectome Project dataset as it is the primary dataset used in the study. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
