To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KARL-Trans-NER: Knowledge Aware Representation Learning for Named Entity Recognition using Transformers" by Avi Chawla et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three publicly available NER datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In this case, they mention three datasets: **CoNLL 2003**, **CoNLL++**, and **OntoNotes v5**. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their structure, size, and any relevant statistics.

In the **table provided in the experiments section**, the authors summarize the statistics for the datasets, including the number of training, testing, and development samples, as well as the number of tags. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' characteristics.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

1. **CoNLL 2003**:
   > Sang, E. F. T. K., & Meulder, F. D. (2003). Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 Shared Task: Language-Independent Named Entity Recognition. CoRR, cs.CL/0306050.

2. **CoNLL++**:

3. **OntoNotes v5**:

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
