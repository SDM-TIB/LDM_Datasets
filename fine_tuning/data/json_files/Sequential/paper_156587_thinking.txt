To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Graph Expansion in Pruned Recurrent Neural Network Layers Preserve Performance" by Suryam Arnav Kalra et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments conducted, and it mentions that results were obtained for benchmark sequences, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Sequential MNIST**: This dataset is derived from the MNIST digit dataset, where each row of a 28x28 image is presented as a sequence of length 28. The authors also mention variations of this dataset with added noise.

2. **Sequential CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which has 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. The authors describe how they constructed a sequential version of this dataset.

3. **Google Speech Commands**: This dataset contains 65,000 one-second long utterances of 10 short words, designed for training and evaluating keyword spotting systems.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **Sequential MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Quoc V. Le, Navdeep Jaitly, and Geoffrey E. Hinton. *A simple way to initialize recurrent networks of rectified linear units*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.00941, 2015.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Shiyu Chang, Yang Zhang, Wei Han, Mo Yu, Xiaoxiao Guo, Wei Tan, Xiaodong Cui, Michael Witbrock, Mark A Hasegawa-Johnson, and Thomas S Huang. *Dilated recurrent neural networks*. Advances in neural information processing systems, 30, 2017.

- For **Google Speech Commands**, the citation is:
  > Pete Warden. *Speech commands: A dataset for limited-vocabulary speech recognition*. 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all necessary details are captured accurately and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
