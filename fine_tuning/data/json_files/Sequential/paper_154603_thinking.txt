To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating Adversarial Computer Programs Using Optimized Obfuscations" by Shashank Srikant et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses evaluating the proposed methods on Python and Java programs, which suggests that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention using a well-maintained dataset of roughly 150K Python programs (Raychev et al., 2016) and 700K Java programs (Alon et al., 2018) for their experiments. This is a crucial finding as it provides the names and sizes of the datasets used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Python dataset**, the citation is:
   > Veselin Raychev, Pavol Bielik, and Martin Vechev. *Probabilistic model for code with decision trees*. ACM SIGPLAN Notices, 51(10):731â€“747, 2016.

2. For the **Java dataset**, the citation is:
   > Uri Alon, Shaked Brody, Omer Levy, and Eran Yahav. *code2seq: Generating sequences from structured representations of code*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1808.01400, 2018.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now compile this information into a structured format for further use.

This process ensures that I have accurately extracted the relevant datasets from the paper, along with their full citations, which is essential for proper referencing and validation in future work.
