To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Future Sales of Retail Products using Machine Learning" by Devendra Swami et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors are working with a time-series dataset consisting of daily sales data provided by Kaggle, which suggests that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** and **data** sections. In the **data section**, the authors refer to the dataset as a combination of time series and static data, specifically mentioning that it consists of daily sales data. They also note that this dataset is part of a Kaggle competition titled "Predict Future Sales."

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their approach to using this dataset for forecasting sales, but they do not mention any additional datasets. Therefore, it appears that the primary dataset used in this research is the one provided by Kaggle.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Kaggle dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **Predict Future Sales dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kaggle. *Predict future sales*. Online, 2018. URL https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/overview.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Kaggle dataset, ensuring it is ready for any further processing or review.
