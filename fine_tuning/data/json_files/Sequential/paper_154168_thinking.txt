To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Convolutional LSTM based Residual Network for Deepfake Video Detection" by Shahroz Tariq et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **FaceForensics++ dataset**, which indicates that there are datasets involved in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the importance of datasets for deepfake detection. They specifically mention the **FaceForensics++ dataset** and its various components, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in **section 3.4 (Implementation Details)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. They list the following datasets:

1. **FaceForensics++**: This dataset includes various types of manipulated videos, specifically:
   - **Pristine (Real)**: 1,000 videos
   - **DeepFake (DF)**: 1,000 videos
   - **FaceSwap (FS)**: 1,000 videos
   - **Face2Face (F2F)**: 1,000 videos
   - **NeuralTextures (NT)**: 1,000 videos

   Additionally, they mention the **DeepFakeDetection (DFD)** dataset, which contains 3,363 videos (363 real and 3,000 fake).

The authors also provide a breakdown of how they used these datasets for training, validation, and testing, which confirms their relevance to the experiments conducted.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citation for the **FaceForensics++ dataset** is as follows:
- Rössler, A., Cozzolino, D., Verdoliva, L., Riess, C., Thies, J., & Nießner, M. (2019). FaceForensics++: Learning to Detect Manipulated Facial Images. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019.

For the **DeepFakeDetection dataset**, the citation is:
- Deepfake Detection Challenge. (2019). Deepfake Detection Challenge. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research along with their proper citations.
