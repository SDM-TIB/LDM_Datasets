To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DoMo-AC: Doubly Multi-step Off-policy Actor-Critic Algorithm" by Yunhao Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are referenced. The abstract mentions that the proposed algorithm shows improvements on **Atari-57 game benchmarks**, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these benchmarks.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to find specific mentions of datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors discuss the performance of their algorithm on the **Atari-57 games**, which is a well-known benchmark in reinforcement learning. I will confirm whether they provide any details about the dataset or its source.

Upon reviewing the **references section**, I will check for any citations that pertain to the Atari-57 dataset. The Atari-57 games are typically associated with the following citation:

- For the **Atari-57 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marc G. Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253â€“279, 2013.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the primary dataset referenced is the Atari-57 games.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Atari-57 dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **Atari-57 Games**: A benchmark dataset used for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms, with the citation provided above.

This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
