To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Empirical Analysis on the Vulnerabilities of End-to-End Speech Segregation Models" by Rahil Parikh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract hints at the use of end-to-end learning models for speech segregation, but I need to find specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference the **WSJ-2-Mix dataset** as a benchmark for evaluating their models. This is a clear indication that this dataset is significant for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly mention that they perform their analysis on **ConvTasnet and DPT-Net trained on the WSJ-2-Mix data**. They also describe how they filter the validation set of this dataset to analyze the network's performance under different conditions.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the WSJ-2-Mix dataset, I will check the **References section**. The citation for the WSJ-2-Mix dataset is as follows:
> J. R. Hershey, Z. Chen, J. Le Roux, and S. Watanabe. "Deep clustering: Discriminative embeddings for segmentation and separation." In 2016 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 31â€“35, 2016.

Since the paper primarily discusses the WSJ-2-Mix dataset, I will note that this is the main dataset used for their experiments.

Now, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the WSJ-2-Mix dataset as required.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
