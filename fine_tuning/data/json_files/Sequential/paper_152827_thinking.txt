To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Persona-Aware Tips Generation" by Piji Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions that the authors use five datasets from different domains for evaluation, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets. They specifically mention using five datasets from different domains, including:

1. **Electronics**: A dataset from Amazon 5-core, which includes user ratings and reviews related to electronic products.
2. **Movies & TV**: Another dataset from Amazon 5-core, containing ratings and reviews for movies and TV shows.
3. **Clothing, Shoes and Jewelry**: This dataset is also from Amazon 5-core, focusing on fashion-related products.
4. **Home and Kitchen**: A dataset from Amazon 5-core that includes ratings and reviews for home and kitchen items.
5. **Yelp Challenge**: A large-scale dataset consisting of restaurant reviews and tips.

The paper provides a brief description of each dataset, including the number of users, items, reviews, and vocabulary size.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are commonly used in research and may not have specific papers associated with them, I will note that the Amazon datasets can be cited as follows:

- For the **Amazon 5-core datasets** (Electronics, Movies & TV, Clothing, Shoes and Jewelry, Home and Kitchen), the citation is:
  > Julian McAuley and Jure Leskovec. *Hidden Factors and Hidden Topics: Understanding Rating Dimensions with Review Text*. In Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys), pages 165â€“172, 2013. Available at: http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon

- For the **Yelp Challenge dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yelp. *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. Available at: https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
