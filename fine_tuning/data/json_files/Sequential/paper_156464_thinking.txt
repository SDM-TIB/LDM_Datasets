To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Aspect Category Learning and Sentiment Analysis Using Weakly Supervised Learning" by Kalpa Subbaiha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of the **Amazon Reviews for Sentiment Analysis** dataset, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will examine the **Research Methodology** section, specifically **section 3.1 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they describe the dataset as containing millions of customer reviews and corresponding star ratings, specifically mentioning that it includes 3,600,000 reviews collected for products sold by Amazon. This section confirms the dataset's significance in their research.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- **Amazon Reviews for Sentiment Analysis**:
  > Amazon Reviews for Sentiment Analysis. Kaggle. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews (accessed September 22, 2023).

Since this is a dataset from Kaggle, the citation format is slightly different from traditional academic papers, but it is still important to include the access date.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Amazon Reviews for Sentiment Analysis**: This dataset includes millions of customer reviews and corresponding star ratings, with a total of 3,600,000 reviews collected for products sold by Amazon. It is utilized for sentiment analysis and aspect category learning in the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
