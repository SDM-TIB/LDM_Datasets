To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Power Data Classification: A Hybrid of a Novel Local Time Warping and LSTM" by Yuanlong Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the classification of power consumption series for energy monitoring, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to power consumption.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any explicit references to datasets. The introduction outlines the problem of energy consumption monitoring and mentions the collection of power data, indicating that a dataset is likely involved.

I will then look into **section III (Power Series Data Collection and Preliminary Analysis)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors describe the collection of power series data, specifying that they collected data from 13 classes of power data, including web server power data and Spark/Hadoop MapReduce programs. They also mention the number of sequences collected for each class.

In this section, I will note the following datasets:

1. **Web Server Power Data**: This dataset includes power consumption data from web servers, which typically exhibit continuous fluctuation patterns.

2. **Spark/Hadoop MapReduce Programs**: This dataset includes power consumption data from various programs run on Spark and Hadoop platforms. The authors specify that they collected data from 13 classes, with specific programs like "Word Count," "Sorting," and "MLlib."

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are derived from the authors' own experiments, they may not have formal citations like published datasets. Instead, I will summarize the datasets based on the information provided in the paper.

For the **Web Server Power Data**, I will note that it is a collection of power consumption sequences from web servers, but no formal citation is provided.

For the **Spark/Hadoop MapReduce Programs**, I will summarize that this dataset includes power consumption data from various programs, but again, no formal citation is provided.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly describe each dataset and include any relevant details such as the number of classes and types of programs involved. I will also note that while the datasets are not formally cited, they are integral to the research presented in the paper.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **Web Server Power Data**: Power consumption data from web servers.
2. **Spark/Hadoop MapReduce Programs**: Power consumption data from various programs on Spark and Hadoop platforms.

I will ensure to document the details of these datasets as described in the paper, even if they do not have formal citations.
