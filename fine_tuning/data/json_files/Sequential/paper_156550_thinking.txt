To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ArEEG_Chars: Dataset for Envisioned Speech Recognition using EEG for Arabic Characters" by Hazem Darwish et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors created an EEG dataset for Arabic characters named **ArEEG_Chars**, which is a clear indication that this dataset is central to the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe the dataset collection process in detail, including the number of participants, the EEG recording device used (Emotiv EPOC X), and the specifics of how the data was collected. They mention that they collected **930 EEG recordings**, which were analyzed to create a total of **39,857 recordings** of EEG signals.

I will also check the **conclusion** section to confirm that the dataset is intended to be made public for researchers, which reinforces its significance.

Now, I will compile the necessary information for the dataset:

1. **ArEEG_Chars**: This dataset is specifically created for EEG signals of Arabic characters. The authors emphasize that it is the first dataset of its kind for Arabic characters and will be publicly available for research purposes.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is created by the authors themselves, I will cite the paper as the source of the dataset:

- For **ArEEG_Chars**, the citation is:
  > Hazem Darwish, Abdalrahman Al Malah, Khloud Al Jallad, Nada Ghneim. *ArEEG_Chars: Dataset for Envisioned Speech Recognition using EEG for Arabic Characters*. Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Arab International University, Daraa, Syria.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare to create the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference in future research.
