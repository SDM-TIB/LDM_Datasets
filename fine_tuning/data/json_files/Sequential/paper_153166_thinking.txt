To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-time Visual Object Tracking with Natural Language Description" by Qi Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will pay particular attention to the introduction and experiments sections where datasets are likely to be discussed in detail.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the importance of standard datasets for visual object tracking and reference two specific datasets: **LaSOT** and **OTB-99-lang**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their evaluation.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Criteria)**, where the authors explicitly state that they are using two publicly available tracking datasets with natural language annotations: **LaSOT** and **OTB-99-lang**. They discuss the characteristics of these datasets and their relevance to the study.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For **LaSOT**, the citation is:
   > Heng Fan, Liting Lin, Fan Yang, Peng Chu, Ge Deng, Sijia Yu, Hexin Bai, Yong Xu, Chunyuan Liao, and Haibin Ling. *LaSOT: A high-quality benchmark for large-scale single object tracking*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.07845, 2018.

2. For **OTB-99-lang**, the citation is:
   > Zhenyang Li, Ran Tao, Efstratios Gavves, Cees G. M. Snoek, and Arnold W.M. Smeulders. *Tracking by natural language specification*. In The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), July 2017.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the key details for each dataset:

- **LaSOT**: A large-scale dataset for single object tracking that includes a diverse set of videos and is designed to facilitate the evaluation of tracking algorithms.
  
- **OTB-99-lang**: A dataset that includes natural language annotations for tracking, allowing for the evaluation of trackers conditioned on language descriptions.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or processing.
