To extract datasets from the research paper titled "InitialGAN: A Language GAN with Completely Random Initialization" by Da Ren and Qing Li, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any subsections that detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets in the experiments section:

1. **COCO Image Caption Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as being used for training, and it consists of 50,000 sentences. I will note the details provided about the dataset, including its purpose and any specific characteristics mentioned.

2. **EMNLP 2017 News Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned as being used for training, with a total of 200,000 sentences. Again, I will capture any relevant details provided in the paper.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For the **COCO Image Caption Dataset**, the citation is:
  > T. Lin, M. Maire, S. J. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: common objects in context*. In Computer Vision - ECCV 2014 - 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V, ser. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 8693. Springer, 2014, pp. 740–755.

- For the **EMNLP 2017 News Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Li, W. Monroe, T. Shi, S. Jean, A. Ritter, and D. Jurafsky. *Adversarial learning for neural dialogue generation*. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, EMNLP 2017, Copenhagen, Denmark, September 9-11, 2017, pp. 2157–2169.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
