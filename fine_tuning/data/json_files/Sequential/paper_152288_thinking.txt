To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Faster Training of Very Deep Networks Via p-Norm Gates" by Trang Pham et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on "large sequence and vector datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section III), where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **MiniBooNE Dataset**: This dataset is used for a binary classification task involving particle identification. The authors provide a brief description of the dataset, including its dimensions and the number of training and validation samples.

2. **Sensorless Drive Diagnosis Dataset**: This dataset is used for classifying motor current data into 11 different classes. Similar to the MiniBooNE dataset, the authors provide details about its dimensions and the number of training and validation samples.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the datasets as follows:

- For the **MiniBooNE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > "MiniBooNE particle identification." UCI Machine Learning Repository. [Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/MiniBooNE+particle+identiﬁcation).

- For the **Sensorless Drive Diagnosis Dataset**, the citation is:
  > "Dataset for Sensorless Drive Diagnosis." UCI Machine Learning Repository. [Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dataset+for+Sensorless+Drive+Diagnosis).

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. 

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
