To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TorchBeast: A PyTorch Platform for Distributed RL" by Heinrich Küttler et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the implementation of the IMPALA algorithm and mentions the use of environments provided by the OpenAI Gym interface, which suggests that datasets related to reinforcement learning environments may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors describe their testing of TorchBeast on the classic Atari suite. This indicates that the Atari environments are likely the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for specific mentions of the Atari games or datasets utilized in their experiments.

In the experiments section, the authors refer to the **Atari task suite** as the environment for their experiments. They also mention that they used the OpenAI Gym API to access these environments. This confirms that the Atari environments are indeed the datasets they are working with.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Atari dataset. The relevant citation for the Atari environments is:

- For the **Atari Learning Environment**, the citation is:
  > M. G. Bellemare, Y. Naddaf, J. Veness, and M. Bowling. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253–279, Jun 2013.

Additionally, the authors mention using the **OpenAI Gym** for their environments, which is another important dataset reference. The citation for OpenAI Gym is:
- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
