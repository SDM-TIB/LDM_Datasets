To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EKT: Exercise-aware Knowledge Tracing for Student Performance Prediction" by Qi Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset, which indicates that there is at least one dataset used in their research. I will look for specific names or descriptions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 7) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention that the dataset was collected from **Zhixue**, an online learning system, and provides statistics about the dataset, including the number of records, students, exercises, and knowledge concepts.

The paper provides detailed statistics about the dataset, which includes:
- **Original dataset**: 68,337,149 records, 1,100,726 students, 1,825,767 exercises, and 37 knowledge concepts.
- **Pruned dataset**: 5,596,075 records, 84,909 students, and 15,045 exercises.

The authors also mention that the dataset is specifically focused on mathematics exercises, which is crucial for understanding the context of the data.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from a specific online learning platform (Zhixue), I will treat it as a unique dataset and provide a citation that reflects its source.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> Zhixue. *Zhixue Online Learning System*. Available at: http://www.zhixue.com (accessed October 2023).

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation accurately.

In summary, the key steps I will take are:
1. Review the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Examine the experiments section for detailed descriptions and statistics of the datasets.
3. Identify the source of the dataset and prepare a citation.
4. Compile the information into a structured format for clarity and completeness.
