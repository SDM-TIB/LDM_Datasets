To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequential Late Fusion Technique for Multi-modal Sentiment Analysis" by Debapriya Banerjee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of the **MOSI dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is central to the research. The introduction may provide additional context or details about the dataset.

Next, I will examine the **method** section, specifically **section 3.1 (Uni-modal Feature Extraction)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that they used **2199 short video utterances from the MOSI dataset**, which were annotated with sentiment labels ranging from -3 to +3. This confirms the dataset's relevance and provides insight into its structure.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **related work** or **discussion** sections. However, the primary focus appears to be on the MOSI dataset, as no other datasets are explicitly referenced in the provided text.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MOSI dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **MOSI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Amir Zadeh, Rowan Zellers, Eli Pincus, and Louis-Philippe Morency. *MOSI: Multimodal Corpus of Sentiment Intensity and Subjectivity Analysis in Online Opinion Videos*. arXiv:1606.06259 [cs.CL], 2016.

Since the paper primarily discusses the MOSI dataset, I will document this dataset's details and citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that all information is accurately represented for potential downstream processing or review.
