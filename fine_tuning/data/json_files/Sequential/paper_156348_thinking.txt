To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Feature Pyramid biLSTM: Using Smartphone Sensors for Transportation Mode Detection" by Qinrui Tang and Hao Cheng, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used data from the **2018 Sussex-Huawei Locomotion (SHL) challenge dataset** for their experiments, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically **section III (Mode Detection Using Locomotion Data)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They describe the SHL dataset as comprising eight primary modes of transportation (Still, Walk, Run, Bike, Car, Bus, Train, and Subway) and mention that it includes data collected from smartphones using various sensors.

In this section, the authors also provide specifics about the dataset, such as:
- The dataset contains 753 hours of locomotion data.
- It was collected by three users at four distinct positions (hand, hips, torso, and bag).
- The data includes measurements from accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers.

The authors also mention that they used a subset of the SHL dataset for their experiments, specifically the **SHL challenge 2018**, which consists of 271 hours for training and 95 hours for testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SHL dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> H. Gjoreski, M. Ciliberto, L. Wang, F. J. Ordonez Morales, S. Mekki, S. Valentin, and D. Roggen. *The university of sussex-huawei locomotion and transportation dataset for multimodal analytics with mobile devices*. IEEE Access, vol. 6, pp. 42 592–42 604, 2018.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Sussex-Huawei Locomotion (SHL) challenge dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset comprising eight primary modes of transportation (Still, Walk, Run, Bike, Car, Bus, Train, Subway) collected from smartphones using various sensors (accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers).
   - **Size**: 753 hours of locomotion data, with a subset of 271 hours for training and 95 hours for testing.
   - **Citation**: H. Gjoreski, M. Ciliberto, L. Wang, F. J. Ordonez Morales, S. Mekki, S. Valentin, and D. Roggen. *The university of sussex-huawei locomotion and transportation dataset for multimodal analytics with mobile devices*. IEEE Access, vol. 6, pp. 42 592–42 604, 2018.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset details into a structured format for further processing or review.
