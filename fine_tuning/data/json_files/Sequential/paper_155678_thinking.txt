To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TT-NF: Tensor Train Neural Fields" by Anton Obukhov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not mention specific datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in prior work, which could be relevant.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their usage in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **Blender dataset** for their neural rendering experiments. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its characteristics and how it was utilized in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Blender dataset. The citation is crucial for proper documentation and should include all necessary details such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

The citation for the Blender dataset is:
> Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P. Srinivasan, Matthew Tancik, Jonathan T. Barron, Ravi Ramamoorthi, and Ren Ng. *Nerf: Representing scenes as neural radiance fields for view synthesis*. In ECCV, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Blender dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured for future reference or processing.
