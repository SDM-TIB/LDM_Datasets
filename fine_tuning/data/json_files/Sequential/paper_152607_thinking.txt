To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ordered Neurons: Integrating Tree Structures into Recurrent Neural Networks" by Yikang Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed ON-LSTM model achieves good performance on four different tasks, which suggests that datasets may be involved in these evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors describe the tasks they evaluated their model on. They mention evaluating the ON-LSTM on tasks such as language modeling, unsupervised constituency parsing, targeted syntactic evaluation, and logical inference. I will look for specific datasets associated with these tasks.

In **Section 5.1 (Language Modeling)**, the authors state that they evaluated their model on the **Penn TreeBank (PTB)** dataset. This dataset is crucial for language modeling tasks, and I will note its details.

In **Section 5.2 (Unsupervised Constituency Parsing)**, the authors mention using the **WSJ10 dataset** and the **WSJ test set** for evaluating unsupervised constituency parsing. I will extract details about these datasets as well.

In **Section 5.3 (Targeted Syntactic Evaluation)**, the authors refer to a 90 million word subset of **Wikipedia** as the training data for their targeted syntactic evaluation tasks. This dataset is also relevant and should be included.

In **Section 5.4 (Logical Inference)**, the authors describe a logical inference task but do not specify a dataset name. However, they mention using a specific train/test split from the original codebase, which I will note for completeness.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **Penn TreeBank (PTB)**, the citation is:
   > Marcus, M. P., Marcinkiewicz, M. A., & Santorini, B. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313-330.

2. For the **WSJ10 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Klein, D., & Manning, C. D. (2002). A generative constituent-context model for improved grammar induction. In *Proceedings of the 40th Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics* (pp. 128-135).

3. For the **WSJ test set**, the citation is the same as for WSJ10 since it is derived from the same source.

4. For the **Wikipedia dataset**, there is no specific citation provided in the paper, but I will note that it is a 90 million word subset of Wikipedia.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
