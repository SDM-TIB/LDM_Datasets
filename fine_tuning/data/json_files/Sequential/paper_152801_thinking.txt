To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Neural Response Diversity with Frequency-Aware Cross-Entropy Loss" by Shaojie Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they refer to two datasets:

1. **OpenSubtitles database (OSDb)**: The authors describe this dataset as an online corpus of movie subtitles, specifically using the 2011 version, which contains approximately 30 million message-response pairs for training.

2. **Twitter**: This dataset is noted as a commonly used source for dialogue generation research, with the authors using a version that contains around 904,000 training examples formatted as context-message-response triples.

To confirm the details of these datasets, I will also check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **OpenSubtitles database (OSDb)**, the citation is:
  > Jörg Tiedemann. *News from OPUS-A Collection of Multilingual Parallel Corpora with Tools and Interfaces*. In Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing (RANLP ’09), Vol. 5, pages 237–248, 2009.

- For the **Twitter dataset**, the authors do not provide a specific citation in the references, but they mention using a version released by a previous study. I will note that the dataset is commonly referenced in dialogue generation literature, but I will not provide a specific citation since it is not included in the paper.

Now, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and citations:

1. **OpenSubtitles database (OSDb)**: An online corpus of movie subtitles, using the 2011 version with approximately 30 million message-response pairs for training.
   - Citation: Jörg Tiedemann. *News from OPUS-A Collection of Multilingual Parallel Corpora with Tools and Interfaces*. In Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing (RANLP ’09), Vol. 5, pages 237–248, 2009.

2. **Twitter dataset**: A dataset containing around 904,000 training examples formatted as context-message-response triples, commonly used in dialogue generation research.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided in the paper.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
