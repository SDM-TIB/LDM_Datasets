To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-level Product Category Prediction through Text Classification" by Wesley Ferreira Maia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study utilizes a "robust Brazilian retail dataset," which suggests that a specific dataset is being referenced.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data and Methodology)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their study. They refer to the dataset as "Classificação Produtos Varejo CPG PTBR," provided by Gilsiley Henrique Darú on Kaggle. This is a clear identification of the dataset being utilized.

In this section, the authors describe the dataset as comprising 153,445 items with various classifications, including segments, categories, subcategories, and product names. This detailed description confirms its relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors provide a reference for the dataset as follows:

- For the "Classificação Produtos Varejo CPG PTBR" dataset, the citation is:
  > G. H. Darú. *Classificação produtos varejo cpg ptbr*, 2022. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/dsv/4265348.

With this information, I have successfully identified the dataset and its citation. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the citation is included for proper attribution.
