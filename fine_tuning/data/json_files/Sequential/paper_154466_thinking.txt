To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Forecasting Commodity Prices Using Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the paper focuses on forecasting cotton and oil prices, which suggests that there are datasets related to these commodities.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Data)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their analysis. Here, they mention that they use international prices for two commodities: cotton and oil. They specify that the cotton price is derived from the Cotton A index and that the oil price is based on the average spot price of Brent, Dubai, and West Texas Intermediate.

In this section, the authors provide additional details about the datasets:
1. **Cotton Dataset**: This dataset consists of monthly prices of cotton, specifically the Cotton A index, with a total of 708 data points from January 1960 to December 2018.
2. **Oil Dataset**: This dataset includes the average spot prices of Brent, Dubai, and West Texas Intermediate, also containing 708 data points for the same time period.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from publicly available sources (World Bank commodity prices dataset), I will cite the source accordingly.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:
- For the **Cotton Dataset**:
  > World Bank. *World Bank Commodity Prices*. Retrieved from [World Bank website](https://www.worldbank.org).

- For the **Oil Dataset**:
  > World Bank. *World Bank Commodity Prices*. Retrieved from [World Bank website](https://www.worldbank.org).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or reference.
