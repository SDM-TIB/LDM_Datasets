To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Branch in Combinatorial Optimization with Graph Pointer Networks" by Rui Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed model is evaluated on benchmark problems, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will carefully review the **experiments section** (Section VI) to identify any datasets used for evaluation. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets.

In this paper, the authors mention three benchmark combinatorial optimization problems: 

1. **Set Covering Problem**: The instances contain 1,000 columns, and the model is trained on instances with 500 rows.
2. **Capacitated Facility Location Problem**: Instances are generated with 100 facilities, trained on instances with 100 customers.
3. **Maximum Independent Set Problem**: Instances are generated following a specific process, trained on instances of 500 nodes.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or benchmark problems mentioned. However, since these problems are well-known in the field, they may not have specific citations like datasets typically do.

For the **Set Covering Problem**, I will refer to the following citation:
- E. Balas and A. Ho. "Set covering algorithms using cutting planes, heuristics, and subgradient optimization: a computational study." In *Combinatorial Optimization*, Springer, 1980, pp. 37–60.

For the **Capacitated Facility Location Problem**, the citation is:
- G. Cornu´ejols, R. Sridharan, and J.-M. Thizy. "A comparison of heuristics and relaxations for the capacitated plant location problem." *European Journal of Operational Research*, vol. 50, no. 3, pp. 280–297, 1991.

For the **Maximum Independent Set Problem**, I will use:
- D. Bergman, A. A. Cire, W.-J. Van Hoeve, and J. Hooker. "Decision diagrams for optimization." Springer, 2016, vol. 1.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
