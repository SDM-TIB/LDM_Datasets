To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SAR Target Recognition Using the Multi-aspect-aware Bidirectional LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks" by Fan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information and provide full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a novel method for SAR target recognition, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors describe the data used for their experiments. In this section, they mention the **Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR)** program as the primary dataset for developing and evaluating their ATR algorithms. This is a significant dataset in the SAR community.

I will also look for any specific details about the dataset, such as the types of images, the number of classes, and the conditions under which the data was collected. The authors mention that the MSTAR dataset consists of X-band SAR images with a resolution of 1 foot by 1 foot and includes ten types of vehicle targets, which is crucial information for describing the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MSTAR dataset. The citation is typically provided in the context of the dataset's description or in the references to prior works that utilized the dataset.

The citation for the MSTAR dataset is:
> "Moving and stationary target acquisition and recognition (MSTAR) public dataset," tech. rep., 1995.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **MSTAR Dataset**: This dataset is used for developing and evaluating automatic target recognition algorithms. It includes a variety of SAR images of ground targets, specifically designed for ATR research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete for future reference or processing.
