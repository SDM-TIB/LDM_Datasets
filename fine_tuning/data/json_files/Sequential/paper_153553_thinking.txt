To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long-length Legal Document Classification" by Lulu Wan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study focuses on classifying lengthy legal documents and mentions the use of a dataset from an online public database, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Related Work)**, where the authors discuss commonly used datasets for document classification. They mention four datasets: **Reuters-21578**, **ArXiv Academic Paper Dataset (AAPD)**, **IMDB reviews**, and **Yelp 2014 reviews**. I will note these datasets and look for their descriptions and citations.

In **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they used for evaluation, which is sourced from the **EDGAR** database. They specify that this dataset includes various filing types and contains a total of 28,445 documents, with 5,689 documents for each filing type. This section will be crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and its significance in the study.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. I will refer to the **References section** for accurate citations:

1. **Reuters-21578**:
   > Chidanand, A., Fred, D., and M. Weiss, S. (1994). *Reuters-21578 Dataset*.

2. **ArXiv Academic Paper Dataset (AAPD)**:
   > Yang, P., Sun, X., Li, W., Ma, S., Wu, W., and Wang, H. (2018). *SGM: Sequence generation model for multi-label classification*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.04822.

3. **IMDB reviews**:
   > Maas, A. L., Daly, R. E., Pham, P. T., Huang, D., Ng, A. Y., and Potts, C. (2011). *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, volume 1, pages 142â€“150.

4. **Yelp 2014 reviews**:
   > Yelp (2014). *Yelp dataset challenge*.

5. **EDGAR**:
   > EDGAR (2019). *The electronic data gathering, analysis, and retrieval system*.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Reuters-21578**: A dataset commonly used for text classification tasks, consisting of news articles categorized into different topics.
- **AAPD**: A dataset containing academic papers from ArXiv, used for multi-label classification tasks.
- **IMDB reviews**: A dataset of movie reviews used for sentiment analysis, containing labeled reviews as positive or negative.
- **Yelp 2014 reviews**: A dataset from Yelp containing user reviews of businesses, used for various NLP tasks.
- **EDGAR**: A dataset of lengthy legal documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, categorized by filing types.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
