To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Ensemble Approach for Facial Expression Analysis in Video" by Hong-Hai Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW3) 2022 challenge, which suggests that datasets related to affective behavior analysis are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Related Work)**, where the authors summarize datasets related to their study. Here, they mention the **Aff-Wild2 dataset**, which is crucial for the tasks they are addressing. The description indicates that this dataset has been extended from Aff-Wild1 and includes various annotations for valence-arousal regression, basic emotions, and Action Units.

In **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, the authors provide specific details about the datasets used for their experiments. They mention:

1. **Aff-Wild2 Dataset**: This dataset contains 567 videos annotated for valence-arousal, 548 videos for expression categories, and 547 videos for Action Units, with a total of 172,360 images annotated for various emotional states.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Aff-Wild2 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **Aff-Wild2 Dataset**:
  > Dimitrios Kollias, Viktoriia Sharmanska, and Stefanos Zafeiriou. *Expression, affect, action unit recognition: Aff-wild2, multi-task learning and arcface*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1910.04855, 2019.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their citations, which are critical for proper referencing in any subsequent analysis or application of the research findings.
