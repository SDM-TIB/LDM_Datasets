To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identifying the Style by a Qualified Reader" by Boris Orekhov, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of character-based LSTM models trained on texts by famous Russian-speaking poets, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Experiment Design** and **Data Overview** sections. Here, the author describes the training of three LSTM models on different corpora of texts. I will extract the details of these datasets:

1. **Nekrasov Model Dataset**: This dataset consists of texts by Nikolay Nekrasov, with specific statistics provided (1,200,000 characters, 191,000 words, 54,000 lines). 

2. **Mandelshtam Model Dataset**: This dataset includes texts by Osip Mandelshtam, with the following statistics (265,000 characters, 39,000 words, 14,000 lines).

3. **Pasternak Model Dataset**: This dataset is based on the early works of Boris Pasternak, with the statistics (316,000 characters, 50,000 words, 7,000 lines).

In the **Data and Questions** section, the author provides further context about the datasets used for training the models, confirming their relevance to the experiments conducted.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. However, since the datasets are based on the works of specific poets, I will cite the original works or relevant literature that discusses these poets:

- For **Nikolay Nekrasov**, I will use:
  > Nekrasov, Nikolay. *Selected Poems*. Various editions available.

- For **Osip Mandelshtam**, I will use:
  > Mandelshtam, Osip. *The Complete Poems*. Various editions available.

- For **Boris Pasternak**, I will use:
  > Pasternak, Boris. *Selected Poems*. Various editions available.

Since the paper does not provide specific publication details for the datasets, I will reference the poets' works as the authoritative sources.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited, ready for structured output or further processing.
