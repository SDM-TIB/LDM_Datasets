To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pre-training for Abstractive Document Summarization by Reinstating Source Text" by Yanyan Zou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions experiments on two benchmark summarization datasets: **CNN/DailyMail** and **New York Times**. This indicates that these datasets are likely important for the study.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **CNN/DailyMail Dataset**: This dataset consists of news articles and their associated highlights (summaries) collected from CNN and Daily Mail websites. The authors mention that they used the non-anonymized version and provide specific statistics about the number of document-summary pairs for training, validation, and testing.

2. **New York Times Dataset**: This dataset includes articles from the New York Times along with multi-sentence summaries. The authors describe how they constructed the test set and provide the number of articles in the training and validation sets.

Additionally, the authors mention the **GIGA-CM Dataset**, which is used for pre-training their model. This dataset consists of unlabeled documents sampled from the English Gigaword dataset and the training documents in CNN/DailyMail.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **CNN/DailyMail Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hermann, K. M., Kocisky, T., Grefenstette, E., Espeholt, L., Kay, W., Suleyman, M., & Blunsom, P. (2015). Teaching machines to read and comprehend. In Proceedings of the NIPS.

- For the **New York Times Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sandhaus, E. (2008). The New York Times Annotated Corpus. Linguistic Data Consortium.

- For the **GIGA-CM Dataset**, since it is derived from the English Gigaword dataset, I will cite it as:
  > English Gigaword. (2012). Linguistic Data Consortium.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
