To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Image Captioning Algorithm Based on the Hybrid Deep Learning Technique (CNN+GRU)" by Rana Adnan Ahmad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of the **MS COCO dataset** for validation of the proposed model, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail. In this section, the authors describe the experimental setup and explicitly state that the **COCO dataset** was used for testing their model. They mention that the dataset contains **130,000 manually annotated images**, with each image having **4 descriptions** for training purposes, and **5,000 images** used for testing. This confirms the dataset's relevance and details.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the COCO dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Chen, X., Fang, H., Lin, T. Y., Vedantam, R., Gupta, S., Doll√°r, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2015). Microsoft COCO captions: Data collection and evaluation server. arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.00325.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **MS COCO Dataset**: This dataset is used for image captioning and contains 130,000 images with 4 descriptions each for training and 5,000 images for testing.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is accurately recorded, as it is essential for proper referencing in any subsequent work.
