To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PR Product: A Substitute for Inner Product in Neural Networks" by Zhennan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100** datasets, indicating that these are key datasets used in the research.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** for more details about these datasets. In section 4.2, the authors describe the CIFAR datasets, stating that CIFAR10 consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, while CIFAR100 has a similar structure but with 100 categories instead of 10. This confirms that both datasets are indeed utilized in their experiments.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper. In section 5.2, the authors refer to the **MS COCO dataset** for their image captioning experiments. This dataset is significant and should be included in the extraction.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **CIFAR10 Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, 2009.

2. **CIFAR100 Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, 2009. (Note: CIFAR100 is often referenced alongside CIFAR10 as they share the same source.)

3. **MS COCO Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft coco: Common objects in context*. In European conference on computer vision, pages 740–755. Springer, 2014.

With these citations in hand, I will now summarize the datasets:

- **CIFAR10**: A dataset containing 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images across 10 categories.
- **CIFAR100**: A dataset similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 categories, also containing 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
- **MS COCO**: A large-scale dataset containing 123,287 images, each labeled with at least 5 captions, used for image captioning tasks.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
