To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Evolutionary Approach to Bioinspired Classifier Optimisation for Brain-Machine Interaction" by Jordan J. Bird et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study involves EEG data classification and mentions three experiments, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly **section 3 (Data Acquisition)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets for mental and emotional state classification, along with a third dataset called "MindBigData" for digit classification.

1. **Mental State Dataset**: This dataset is used to classify three different states (relaxed, concentrative, neutral) and is sourced from Kaggle. The authors provide a link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/birdy654/eeg-brainwave-dataset-mental-state.

2. **Emotional State Dataset**: This dataset is used to classify emotional states (positive, neutral, negative) and is also sourced from Kaggle. The link provided is: https://www.kaggle.com/birdy654/eeg-brainwave-dataset-feeling-emotions.

3. **MindBigData Dataset**: This dataset is described as a large dataset collected from a single subject thinking of digits from 0 to 9. The authors provide a link to this dataset: http://www.mindbigdata.com/opendb/.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **references section** to ensure I have the full citations for each dataset. However, since the datasets are sourced from online repositories (Kaggle and MindBigData), I will use the provided links as the citations.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes the dataset name, description, and citation.

1. **Mental State Dataset**:
   - Description: A dataset for classifying three mental states (relaxed, concentrative, neutral) based on EEG data.
   - Citation: Bird, J. J., Ekárt, A., & Faria, D. R. (2019). Mental state classification using EEG-based brain-machine interface. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/birdy654/eeg-brainwave-dataset-mental-state.

2. **Emotional State Dataset**:
   - Description: A dataset for classifying emotional states (positive, neutral, negative) based on EEG data.
   - Citation: Bird, J. J., Ekárt, A., & Faria, D. R. (2019). Emotional state classification using EEG-based brain-machine interface. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/birdy654/eeg-brainwave-dataset-feeling-emotions.

3. **MindBigData Dataset**:
   - Description: A large dataset collected from a single subject thinking of digits from 0 to 9.
   - Citation: MindBigData. (2019). Open database. Retrieved from http://www.mindbigdata.com/opendb/.

With this information gathered, I will prepare to format the dataset entries according to the required structure for further processing.
