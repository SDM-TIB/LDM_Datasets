To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical LSTMs with Adaptive Attention for Visual Captioning" by Jingkuan Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors tested their method on various datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they describe three datasets:

1. **Microsoft Video Description Corpus (MSVD)**: This dataset consists of 1,970 short video clips, approximately 80,000 description pairs, and about 16,000 vocabulary words. The authors mention that they split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets with specific numbers of videos for each.

2. **MSR Video to Text (MSR-VTT)**: This dataset contains 10,000 web video clips, each annotated with approximately 20 natural language sentences. It covers 20 categories and includes a wide variety of visual content, totaling around 200,000 clip-sentence pairs.

3. **Large Scale Movie Description Challenge (LSMDC)**: This dataset consists of 118,114 sentences and 118,081 video clips sourced from movie scripts, divided into training, validation, public test, and blind test sets.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **Microsoft Video Description Corpus (MSVD)**, the citation is:
  > Xu, J., Mei, T., Yao, T., & Rui, Y. (2016). MSR-VTT: A large video description dataset for bridging video and language. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

- For **MSR Video to Text (MSR-VTT)**, the citation is:
  > Xu, J., Mei, T., Yao, T., & Rui, Y. (2016). MSR-VTT: A large video description dataset for bridging video and language. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

- For **Large Scale Movie Description Challenge (LSMDC)**, the citation is:
  > Rohrbach, A., Torabi, A., Rohrbach, M., Tandon, N., Pal, C., Larochelle, H., & Courville, A. (2017). Movie description. International Journal of Computer Vision, 123(1), 94-120.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
