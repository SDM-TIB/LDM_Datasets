To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Approximate LSTMs for Time-Constrained Inference: Enabling Fast Reaction in Self-Driving Cars" by Alexandros Kouris et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on a "state-of-the-art driving model for autonomous vehicle navigation," which suggests that a dataset is likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the importance of LSTMs in autonomous driving. They reference a "driving model presented in [31]," which indicates that a specific dataset is used for training or evaluation. I will need to find the corresponding reference in the bibliography.

In the **case study section (VI)**, the authors explicitly mention using the **Berkeley DeepDrive Video dataset (BDDV)**, which is described as a large-scale crowdsourced driving video dataset. This is a clear identification of a dataset used in their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the BDDV dataset. The citation is as follows:
> F. Yu, W. Xian, Y. Chen, F. Liu, M. Liao, V. Madhavan, and T. Darrell. "BDD100K: A Diverse Driving Video Database with Scalable Annotation Tooling." arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.04687, 2018.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: Berkeley DeepDrive Video dataset (BDDV)
   - **Description**: A large-scale crowdsourced driving video dataset used for training a driving model in autonomous vehicle navigation.
   - **Full Citation**: F. Yu, W. Xian, Y. Chen, F. Liu, M. Liao, V. Madhavan, and T. Darrell. "BDD100K: A Diverse Driving Video Database with Scalable Annotation Tooling." arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.04687, 2018.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entry for further processing or review.
