To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A VAE-Bayesian Deep Learning Scheme for Solar Generation Forecasting" by Devinder Kaur et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated using "highly granular solar generation data from Ausgrid distribution network measured using gross meters from 300 individual smart homes having rooftop solar panels." This indicates that there is a specific dataset being used for the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or results sections**. In this paper, **section 4.1 (Data Description)** provides detailed information about the dataset used. It states that the data consists of solar generation values sourced every 30 minutes in kWh, with one year of data from July 1, 2011, to June 30, 2012, for house number 2076. The dataset is divided into training and testing datasets with 14,052 and 3,288 observations, respectively.

Now, I will extract the relevant details about the dataset:

1. **Solar Generation Data from Ausgrid**: This dataset includes solar generation data from 300 individual smart homes, collected every 30 minutes. The data spans one year and is used to evaluate the proposed forecasting method.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper cites the source of the solar generation data as follows:

- For the Ausgrid solar generation data, the citation is:
  > Ausgrid. *Solar home electricity data*. URL: https://www.ausgrid.com.au/Industry/Our-Research/Data-to-share/Solar-home-electricity-data.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information and its citation into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, I have identified the dataset used in the research paper, described its characteristics, and retrieved the full citation. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary information regarding the datasets utilized in the study.
