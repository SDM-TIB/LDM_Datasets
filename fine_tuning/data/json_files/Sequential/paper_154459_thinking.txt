To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Intent Classification and Slot Filling for Privacy Policies" by Jianfeng Chi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the creation of a corpus called **PolicyIE**, which is a strong indication that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific details about the **PolicyIE corpus** in the **introduction** and **construction sections**. The introduction states that the corpus consists of **5,250 intent and 11,788 slot annotations spanning 31 privacy policies of websites and mobile applications**. This provides a clear description of the dataset's scope and purpose.

In the **construction section**, the authors detail the selection process for the privacy policies included in the dataset. They mention that they initially collected **7,500 mobile application privacy policies** and filtered them down to **50 policy documents** for annotation. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's origins and the criteria used for selection.

I will also check the **data statistics section**, which provides quantitative details about the dataset, including the number of policies, sentences, and slots. This section confirms the dataset's structure and the amount of data available for training and testing.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors do not provide a separate citation for the PolicyIE corpus, but they do mention the use of prior works and datasets in their methodology. Since the PolicyIE corpus is a new contribution, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Jianfeng Chi, Wasi Uddin Ahmad, Tu Le, Thomas Norton, Yuan Tian, Kai-Wei Chang. *Intent Classification and Slot Filling for Privacy Policies*. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1-12, 2021.

Finally, I will summarize the findings about the dataset in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. The dataset entry will include the name, description, and citation, ready for further processing or review.
