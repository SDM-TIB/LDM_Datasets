To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Subword Encoding in Lattice LSTM for Chinese Word Segmentation" by Jie Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on four segmentation benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In this section, they state that they evaluated their model on four standard Chinese word segmentation datasets: **CTB6**, **PKU**, **MSR**, and **Weibo**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their research.

I will then look for a **table or section that provides details about these datasets**. In this case, Table 1 presents statistics about the datasets, including the number of training, development, and test samples for each dataset. This information is essential for understanding the datasets' scope and usage.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The paper mentions the following datasets:

1. **Chinese Treebank 6.0 (CTB6)**: 
   - Citation:

2. **PKU Dataset**: 
   - Citation:

3. **MSR Dataset**: 
   - Citation:

4. **Weibo Dataset**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, statistics, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
