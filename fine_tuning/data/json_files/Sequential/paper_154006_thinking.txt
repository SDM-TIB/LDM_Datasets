To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DanHAR: Dual Attention Network For Multimodal Human Activity Recognition Using Wearable Sensors" by Wenbin Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "four public HAR datasets and a weakly labeled dataset," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments and Results)**, as this section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors explicitly mention the datasets they utilized:

1. **WISDM Dataset**: This dataset is described as a public benchmark HAR dataset provided by the Wireless Sensor Data Mining Lab, containing data from 29 participants performing various activities. 

2. **UNIMIB SHAR Dataset**: This dataset is designed for benchmarking multiple classification tasks related to human activities and falls, collected from 30 subjects using a smartphone.

3. **PAMAP2 Dataset**: This dataset includes data from 9 subjects performing 18 different physical activities, recorded using multiple Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs).

4. **OPPORTUNITY Dataset**: This dataset records daily life activities of 12 subjects in a sensor-rich environment, with data collected from various sensors.

5. **Weakly Labeled Dataset**: This dataset was collected using a smartphone and includes data from 10 participants performing daily activities, with a focus on reducing the burden of manual labeling.

After identifying the datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. Here are the citations I will extract:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
