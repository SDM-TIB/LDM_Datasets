To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Signal Alignment for Humanoid Skeletons via the Globally Optimal Reparameterization Algorithm" by Thomas W. Mitchel, Sipu Ruan, and Gregory S. Chirikjian, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of skeleton sequences for action recognition, which suggests that datasets related to skeleton sequences may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the importance of recognizing human actions and the use of skeleton sequences. They reference various signals but do not explicitly name datasets yet.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in the part discussing the GORA-S algorithm, the authors mention validating their algorithm using skeleton sequences from the **NTU RGB+D Action Recognition Dataset**. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will then look for the **experiments section** to confirm the dataset's application. The authors describe their experiments and state that they used the NTU RGB+D Action Recognition Dataset for their validation, which reinforces its significance in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the NTU RGB+D Action Recognition Dataset. The citation is as follows:
> A. Shahroudy, J. Liu, T.-T. Ng, and G. Wang. *NTU RGB+D: A large scale dataset for 3D human activity analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, 2016, pp. 1010â€“1019.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for context on datasets.
2. Identify specific datasets mentioned in the methodology and experiments sections.
3. Confirm the dataset's relevance and application in the research.
4. Retrieve the full citation from the references.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
