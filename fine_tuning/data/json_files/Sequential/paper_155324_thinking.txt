To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparison of LSTM autoencoder based deep learning enabled Bayesian inference using two time series reconstruction approaches" by Saumik Dana, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methods used, but I need to look for specific datasets in the main body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and results sections**, particularly where the author discusses the experiments and the data used for training and testing the LSTM autoencoder. I will look for any references to datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **results section**, the author describes the process of generating displacement time series data for various injection rates. This indicates that synthetic datasets are created for the experiments. I will note the details about these datasets, including how they were generated and any relevant parameters.

I will also check the **appendices and references** for any additional information about datasets or related works that might provide context or citations for the datasets used.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset details, ensuring to include full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the datasets are synthetic, I will note that they are generated based on the described methodology rather than sourced from an external repository.

Finally, I will format the extracted dataset information clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation, as this is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

Now, I will proceed to extract the datasets and their citations based on the information I have gathered from the paper.
