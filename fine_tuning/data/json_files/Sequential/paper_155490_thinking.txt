To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Action Recognition for American Sign Language" by Nguyen Huu Phong and Bernardete Ribeiro, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets. The authors state that they collected an initial dataset of 150 videos for 10 signs and an extension of 225 videos for 15 signs. This indicates that there are two datasets to consider.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the datasets. The introduction discusses the focus on dynamic hand gestures and the challenges in recognizing American Sign Language (ASL). However, it does not provide additional dataset details.

I will then move to **section 2 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe their dataset collection process. They mention that they gathered videos for 10 different signs, specifically referring to animals, and later extended this to 15 signs. The dataset consists of 150 videos (10 signs) and 225 videos (15 signs), with specific details about the number of videos per sign for training and testing.

In this section, the authors provide the following details:
1. **Initial Dataset**: 150 videos for 10 signs (15 videos per sign: 10 for training, 5 for testing).
2. **Extended Dataset**: 225 videos for 15 signs, which includes more general conversation terms.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are collected by the authors themselves and do not refer to external datasets, I will note that the citation for the dataset is essentially the paper itself.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Nguyen Huu Phong and Bernardete Ribeiro. *Action Recognition for American Sign Language*. CISUC â€“ Department of Informatics Engineering, University of Coimbra, 2023.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries based on the information gathered:
1. **Initial ASL Dataset**: 150 videos for 10 signs.
2. **Extended ASL Dataset**: 225 videos for 15 signs.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets and their citations, ready for any structured output or further processing.
