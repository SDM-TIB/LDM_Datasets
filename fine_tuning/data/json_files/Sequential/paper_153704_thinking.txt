To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Two-Level Attention-based Fusion Learning for RGB-D Face Recognition" by Hardik Uppal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two RGB-D face recognition datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **Section II (Related Work)**, where the authors discuss various RGB-D face recognition datasets. Here, they mention several datasets, including:

1. **IIIT-D RGB-D Dataset**: This dataset contains images from 106 subjects captured using a Microsoft Kinect, with a pre-defined protocol for cross-validation.
2. **CurtinFaces RGB-D Dataset**: This dataset includes over 5000 images of 52 subjects, also captured with a Microsoft Kinect.

In **Section IV (Experiments)**, the authors provide further details about these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments and elaborating on their characteristics, such as the number of images and subjects.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **IIIT-D RGB-D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gaurav Goswami, Samarth Bharadwaj, Mayank Vatsa, and Richa Singh. "On RGB-D face recognition using Kinect." In *International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications and Systems*, 2013, pp. 1â€“6.

- For the **CurtinFaces RGB-D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Billy Li, Ajmal Mian, Wanquan Liu, and Aneesh Krishna. "Using Kinect for face recognition under varying poses, expressions, illumination and disguise." In *IEEE Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision*, January 2013.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
