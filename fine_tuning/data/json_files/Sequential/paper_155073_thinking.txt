To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Iterative Decoding for Compositional Generalization in Transformers" by Luana Ruiz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions that the paper focuses on improving compositional generalization in transformers, specifically mentioning the **PCFG**, **Cartesian product**, and **CFQ** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Results and Discussion)**, where the authors detail their experiments with the datasets. In **section 4.1**, the authors describe the **PCFG dataset**, which is a string editing dataset generated by a probabilistic context-free grammar. They mention that it has various splits, including productivity and systematicity splits, which are used to measure compositional generalization.

In **section 4.2**, the authors discuss the **Cartesian product dataset**, which involves two vectors and aims to compute their Cartesian product. They describe the structure of the dataset and the challenges associated with compositional generalization in this context.

In **section 4.3**, the **CFQ dataset** is introduced, which consists of natural language questions paired with SPARQL queries. The authors highlight the challenges of this dataset, particularly regarding the ordering of clauses in the queries.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

1. **PCFG Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Dieuwke Hupkes, Verna Dankers, Mathijs Mul, and Elia Bruni. *Compositionality decomposed: how do neural networks generalise?* Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 67:757–795, 2020.

2. **Cartesian Product Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Santiago Ontañón, Joshua Ainslie, Vaclav Cvicek, and Zachary Fisher. *Making transformers solve compositional tasks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2108.04378, 2021.

3. **CFQ Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Daniel Keysers, Nathanael Schärli, Nathan Scales, Hylke Buisman, Daniel Furrer, Sergii Kashubin, Nikola Momchev, Danila Sinopalnikov, Lukasz Stafiniak, Tibor Tihon, et al. *Measuring compositional generalization: A comprehensive method on realistic data*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1912.09713, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for understanding the context and implications of the findings.
