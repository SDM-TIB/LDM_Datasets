To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Locality Sensitive Hashing-based Sequence Alignment Using Deep Bidirectional LSTM Models" by Neda Tavakoli, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors use the **human reference genome** as a training dataset and a set of **short reads generated using Illumina sequencing technology**. This suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions in the **case study** section, where the authors provide specifics about the datasets used. In this section, they mention using the **Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 38 patch release 13 (GRCh38.p13)** as the reference genome, which has a total sequence length of 3,099,734,149 base pairs and consists of 24 chromosomes. This is a significant dataset for their experiments.

Additionally, they describe the query sequences as **Illumina (HiSeq X Ten) short reads** of length 151, with a total of **401,747,042 spots**. Each spot generates two reads (forward and reverse), which indicates a substantial dataset for their analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 38 (GRCh38.p13)**, the citation is:
   > Human Genome, “Reference sequences.” [Online]. Available: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/000/001/405/GCA_000001405.28_GRCh38.p13

2. For the **Illumina sequencing technology**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, it is commonly referenced in the context of genomic studies. A general citation for Illumina technology could be:
   > Bennett, S. “Solexa Ltd,” Pharmacogenomics, vol. 5, no. 4, pp. 433–438, 2004.

With these details, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Dataset Name**: Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 38 (GRCh38.p13)
   - **Description**: A reference genome with a total sequence length of 3,099,734,149 base pairs, consisting of 24 chromosomes.
   - **Citation**: Human Genome, “Reference sequences.” [Online]. Available: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/000/001/405/GCA_000001405.28_GRCh38.p13

2. **Dataset Name**: Illumina (HiSeq X Ten) Short Reads
   - **Description**: A set of short reads generated using Illumina sequencing technology, totaling 401,747,042 spots, with each spot producing two reads (forward and reverse).
   - **Citation**: Bennett, S. “Solexa Ltd,” Pharmacogenomics, vol. 5, no. 4, pp. 433–438, 2004.

Finally, I will compile these dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
