To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep learning for quadratic hedging in incomplete jump market" by Nacira Agram et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and it may mention specific datasets used for testing the proposed deep learning algorithm.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the **data generation** subsection, as it is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors describe how they generate data for their models, which may include specific datasets or synthetic data generation methods.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any references to datasets used for training or testing the models. The authors may compare their results against standard datasets or benchmarks, which are crucial for understanding the context of their findings.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is important for proper attribution and for readers who may want to access the datasets themselves.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the **Merton model** or **Kou model**, I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these models to provide accurate citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation in the appropriate format.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for presentation or further processing, ensuring that all datasets are accurately represented with their respective citations.
