To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Recurrent-Reinforcement Learning Method for Intelligent AutoScaling of Serverless Functions" by Siddharth Agarwal, Maria A. Rodriguez, and Rajkumar Buyya, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using an **open-source function trace** for their experiments. I will look for specific details about this dataset, such as its name, size, and any relevant characteristics.

In the **system architecture and problem formulation section**, the authors describe the environment setup and mention the use of the **OpenFaaS framework** and **Prometheus monitoring service**. However, I need to ensure that I capture any specific datasets used for training or evaluation purposes.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The authors may refer to existing datasets or studies that provide datasets relevant to their research.

From my reading, I identify the following dataset:

1. **Open-source function trace**: This dataset is utilized for evaluating the proposed autoscaling method. It is referenced in the context of the experiments conducted in the paper.

Now, I will look for the full citation for this dataset in the references section. The authors reference a specific study that provides this dataset:

- For the **open-source function trace**, the citation is:
  > M. Shahrad, R. Fonseca, I. Goiri, G. Chaudhry, P. Batum, J. Cooke, E. Laureano, C. Tresness, M. Russinovich, and R. Bianchini. *Serverless in the wild: Characterizing and optimizing the serverless workload at a large cloud provider*. In Proceedings of the USENIX Annual Technical Conference (USENIX ATC 20), pages 205â€“218, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset details along with the necessary citations.
