To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Abstractiveness of Summarization Models through Calibrated Distillation" by Hwanjun Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on three summarization datasets: **CNNDM**, **XSUM**, and **SAMSum**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that provide detailed descriptions of these datasets. In this paper, the datasets are summarized in **Table 1**, which provides key statistics about each dataset, including the number of training, validation, and testing samples, as well as their abstractiveness scores.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **CNNDM**: This dataset consists of online news articles from CNN and DailyMail, with a total of 287,113 training samples, 13,368 validation samples, and 11,490 testing samples. The dataset is used for news summarization.

2. **XSUM**: This dataset contains articles from BBC News with single-sentence summaries. It has 204,045 training samples, 11,332 validation samples, and 11,334 testing samples, also used for news summarization.

3. **SAMSum**: This dataset includes dialogue data with summaries written by linguists. It consists of 14,732 training samples, 818 validation samples, and 819 testing samples, and is used for dialogue summarization.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CNNDM**:
  > Hermann, K. M., Kocisky, T., Grefenstette, E., Espeholt, L., Kay, W., Suleyman, M., & Blunsom, P. (2015). Teaching machines to read and comprehend. In *NeurIPS*.

- For **XSUM**:
  > Narayan, S., Cohen, S. B., & Lapata, M. (2018). Donâ€™t give me the details, just the summary! Topic-aware convolutional neural networks for extreme summarization. In *EMNLP*.

- For **SAMSum**:
  > Gliwa, B., Mochol, I., Biesek, M., & Wawer, A. (2019). SAMsum corpus: A human-annotated dialogue dataset for abstractive summarization. In *New Frontiers in Summarization*.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
