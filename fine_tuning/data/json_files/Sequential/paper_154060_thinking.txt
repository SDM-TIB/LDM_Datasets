To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cyber Threat Intelligence for Secure Smart City" by Najla Al-Taleb et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their proposed model on two IoT network traffic datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Background** and **Proposed Model** sections, as these are likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. In the **Proposed Model** section, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **BoT-IoT Dataset**: This dataset is designed for forensic analysis and intrusion detection systems (IDS). It contains normal IoT traffic and various types of attack traffic, with detailed subcategories for each type of attack.

2. **TON_IoT Dataset**: This dataset was generated for evaluating cyber threat intelligence in smart cities. It includes a total of 461,043 instances and nine types of attacks.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

- For the **BoT-IoT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > N. Koroniotis, N. Moustafa, E. Sitnikova, and B. Turnbull. "Towards the Development of Realistic Botnet Dataset in the Internet of Things for Network Forensic Analytics: Bot-IoT Dataset." *Futur. Gener. Comput. Syst.*, vol. 100, pp. 779â€“796, 2018.

- For the **TON_IoT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > N. Moustafa. "TON_IoT Datasets." 2020.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, including their descriptions and citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the details provided. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and facilitate further exploration by other researchers.
