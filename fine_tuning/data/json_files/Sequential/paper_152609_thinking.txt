To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Precipitation Nowcasting: Leveraging bidirectional LSTM and 1D CNN" by Maitreya Patel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data pipeline sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the research, but the specific datasets are likely detailed in the data pipeline section.

In **Section II (Data Pipeline)**, the authors describe two datasets used for training their models:

1. **Indian Weather Dataset**: This dataset consists of hourly time series data from Ahmedabad airport, covering the years 2010 to 2017, specifically focusing on the monsoon months from late July to early September. The parameters include temperature, wind speed, pressure, and humidity.

2. **North-America Weather Dataset**: This dataset is publicly available on Kaggle under the title "Historical Hourly Weather Data 2012-2017." It includes multiple weather parameters like humidity, pressure, temperature, wind speed, and wind direction for various cities, focusing on those with significant rainfall.

Next, I will confirm the details of these datasets by checking the **References section** for full citations. The references provide the necessary information to cite these datasets properly:

- For the **Indian Weather Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Time and Date. *Historical Weather Data for Ahmedabad*. Available at: https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/india/ahmadabad/historic?month=6&year=2017.

- For the **North-America Weather Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kaggle. *Historical Hourly Weather Data 2012-2017*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/selfishgene/historical-hourly-weather-data.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective sources.
