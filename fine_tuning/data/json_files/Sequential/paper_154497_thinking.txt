To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Short-term Daily Precipitation Forecasting with Seasonally-Integrated Autoencoder" by Donlapark Ponnoprat, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets used in the study.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study involves forecasting precipitation using data from specific locations, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that describe the data used for the experiments. In this paper, the **experiments section** provides detailed information about the datasets used for training and testing the proposed model.

I will identify the two datasets mentioned:

1. **Chiang Mai International Airport Dataset**: This dataset includes daily meteorological data collected from January 1, 1998, to July 31, 2019. The paper specifies that the data was provided by the Thai Meteorological Department and includes various meteorological variables.

2. **Theodore Francis Green State Airport Dataset**: This dataset consists of daily meteorological data collected from January 1, 2006, to October 31, 2019, and was obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper cites the datasets as follows:

- For the **Chiang Mai International Airport Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ponnoprat, D. (2020). Two daily weather datasets: Chiang Mai International Airport and Theodore Francis Green State Airport. Mendeley Data, v8. doi:10.17632/95mr7pr8rj.8.

- For the **Theodore Francis Green State Airport Dataset**, the same citation applies since both datasets are included in the same repository.

Now that I have the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper.
