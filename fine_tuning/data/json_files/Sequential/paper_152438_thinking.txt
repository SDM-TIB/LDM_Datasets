To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving on Q & A Recurrent Neural Networks Using Noun-Tagging" by Omar El-lakany et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract references the **SimpleQuestions dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. In this case, the **Baseline Experimental Setup** section explicitly mentions the **SimpleQuestions dataset**. Here, the authors describe it as containing 108,442 questions annotated by hand in English, derived from a subset of the FreeBase dataset. This section provides key details about how the dataset was used, including the training, validation, and test splits.

I will also check the **Results** section, where the authors discuss their inability to utilize the full SimpleQuestions dataset for entity detection, confirming its importance in their experiments. They mention using 20% of the dataset for entity detection and 100% for relation prediction, which further emphasizes the dataset's relevance.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the **SimpleQuestions dataset** from the **References section**. The citation is as follows:
> Antoine Bordes, Nicolas Usunier, Sumit Chopra, and Jason Weston. *Large-scale simple question answering with memory networks*. CoRR, abs/1506.02075, 2015.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the **SimpleQuestions dataset**, I will not need to extract additional datasets from this paper.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation in the appropriate format. This will allow for proper referencing and acknowledgment of the dataset used in the research.
