To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Memory Gym: Towards Endless Tasks to Benchmark Memory Capabilities of Agents" by Marco Pleines et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a suite of 2D partially observable environments designed to benchmark memory capabilities, which suggests that these environments may serve as datasets for the experiments. I will look for specific names of these environments.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly focusing on any sections that explicitly discuss the datasets or environments used. In this paper, the authors describe three environments: **Endless Mortar Mayhem**, **Endless Mystery Path**, and **Endless Searing Spotlights**. I will note down the details provided about each environment, including their purpose and characteristics.

In the **results** section, I will check if the authors mention any additional datasets or benchmarks that were used for comparison or validation of their methods. If they reference any external datasets or benchmarks, I will ensure to capture those as well.

After gathering the necessary information, I will refer to the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or environments mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide a complete context for each dataset.

For the environments mentioned:
1. **Endless Mortar Mayhem**: This environment is designed to test the agent's ability to memorize and execute an expanding list of commands.
2. **Endless Mystery Path**: This environment challenges the agent to navigate an endless path while recalling its previous steps.
3. **Endless Searing Spotlights**: This environment requires the agent to track its position while avoiding spotlights and collecting coins.

I will compile the full citations for these environments based on the information provided in the paper and any relevant references.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
