To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Image Generation from Layout" by Bo Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on the **COCO-Stuff** and **Visual Genome** datasets, indicating that these are the datasets used for their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this case, the authors provide a table (Table 1) that lists the statistics for both datasets, including the number of training, validation, and test images, as well as the number of object categories. This confirms the datasets used in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **COCO-Stuff**:
   - Citation:
     > Holger Caesar, Jasper Uijlings, and Vittorio Ferrari. *Coco-stuff: thing and stuff classes in context*. arXiv: 1612.03716, 2016.

2. **Visual Genome**:
   - Citation:
     > Ranjay Krishna, Yuke Zhu, Oliver Groth, Justin Johnson, Kenji Hata, Joshua Kravitz, Stephanie Chen, Yannis Kalandidis, Li-Jia Li, David A Shamma, et al. *Visual genome: connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations*. IJCV, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **COCO-Stuff**: A dataset that includes a variety of object categories and is used for evaluating image generation methods.
- **Visual Genome**: A dataset that provides dense annotations for images, facilitating the study of visual understanding and generation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured for future reference or processing.
