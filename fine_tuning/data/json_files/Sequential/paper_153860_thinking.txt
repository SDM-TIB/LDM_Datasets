To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributional Discrepancy: A Metric for Unconditional Text Generation" by Ping Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of generative models, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the importance of evaluating unconditional text generation models, but they do not specify datasets yet. I will continue to the **experimental setup section** where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments.

In **section 5.1 (Dataset)**, the authors mention two key datasets:

1. **EMNLP2017 WMT News**: This dataset is used as the real corpus for unconditional text generation. It consists of approximately 280,000 sentences for training and 10,000 sentences for testing.

2. **Synthetic Data from GPT-2**: The authors generated synthetic sentences using the GPT-2 model, which consists of 320,000 sentences, with specific splits for training, validation, and testing.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The EMNLP2017 WMT News dataset is a well-known benchmark, and I can find its citation in the literature. The citation for the WMT dataset is:

- For **EMNLP2017 WMT News**, the citation is:
  > "WMT 2017: Neural Machine Translation and Sequence-to-Sequence Models" in Proceedings of the Second Conference on Machine Translation (WMT), 2017.

The synthetic data generated by GPT-2 does not have a specific citation since it is derived from the model itself, but I will reference the original GPT-2 paper for context:

- For **GPT-2**, the citation is:
  > Alec Radford, Jeffrey Wu, Rewon Child, David Luan, Dario Amodei, and Ilya Sutskever. *Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners*. Technical report, OpenAI, 2019.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets and their sources for future reference or analysis.
