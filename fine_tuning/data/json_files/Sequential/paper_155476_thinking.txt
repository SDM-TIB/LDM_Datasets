To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ST-ExpertNet: A Deep Expert Framework for Traffic Prediction" by Hongjun Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on "a wide range of real-world taxi and bike datasets in Beijing and NYC," which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention four datasets:

1. **TaxiBJ**: This dataset consists of trajectory GPS data collected from taxis in Beijing over several time intervals. The authors specify the time periods for data collection, which are from 01/07/2013 to 10/04/2016, and mention that the map of Beijing is divided into 32 Ã— 32 uniform regions, with additional metadata features included.

2. **TaxiNYC**: This dataset contains taxi in-out flow data from NYC, collected from 01/01/2015 to 03/01/2015. The authors note that holidays and time information are used as external factors in this dataset.

3. **BikeNYC-I**: This dataset is published and covers the time interval from 07/01/2016 to 08/29/2016 in NYC-Bike. It is one of two datasets used to distinguish data released from different sources.

4. **BikeNYC-II**: Similar to BikeNYC-I, this dataset covers a different time interval, specifically from 04/01/2014 to 09/30/2014, and is also published in NYC-Bike.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **TaxiBJ**, the citation is:
  > Wang, H., Chen, J., Fan, Z., Zhang, Z., Cai, Z., & Song, X. (2021). *ST-ExpertNet: A Deep Expert Framework for Traffic Prediction*. Journal of Latex Class Files, vol. XX, no. X, August 201X.

- For **TaxiNYC**, the citation is:
  > Wang, H., Chen, J., Fan, Z., Zhang, Z., Cai, Z., & Song, X. (2021). *ST-ExpertNet: A Deep Expert Framework for Traffic Prediction*. Journal of Latex Class Files, vol. XX, no. X, August 201X.

- For **BikeNYC-I**, the citation is:
  > Wang, H., Chen, J., Fan, Z., Zhang, Z., Cai, Z., & Song, X. (2021). *ST-ExpertNet: A Deep Expert Framework for Traffic Prediction*. Journal of Latex Class Files, vol. XX, no. X, August 201X.

- For **BikeNYC-II**, the citation is:
  > Wang, H., Chen, J., Fan, Z., Zhang, Z., Cai, Z., & Song, X. (2021). *ST-ExpertNet: A Deep Expert Framework for Traffic Prediction*. Journal of Latex Class Files, vol. XX, no. X, August 201X.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
