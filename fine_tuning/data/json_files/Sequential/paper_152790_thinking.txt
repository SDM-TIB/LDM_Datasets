To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Intra- and Inter-epoch Temporal Context Network (IITNet) Using Sub-epoch Features for Automatic Sleep Scoring on Raw Single-channel EEG" by Hogeon Seo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the performance of the IITNet model was evaluated on three datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection labeled **"Datasets."** Here, the authors explicitly mention three public datasets used for evaluation: **SleepEDF, MASS, and SHHS**. I will take note of the descriptions provided for each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

1. **SleepEDF**: The SleepEDFx dataset (2013 version) includes PSG records from healthy subjects and those with sleep-related disorders. It contains two-channel EEGs and is labeled according to the Rechtschaffen and Kales (R&K) rules.

2. **MASS**: The Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies (MASS) dataset consists of PSG records from 200 subjects, with epochs labeled according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) rules.

3. **SHHS**: The Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) dataset includes PSG records from a multi-center cohort study, with epochs labeled according to the R&K rules.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

- For **SleepEDF**, the citation is:
  > Kemp, B., Zwinderman, A. H., Tuk, B., Kamphuisen, H. A., & Oberye, J. J. (2000). Analysis of a sleep-dependent neuronal feedback loop: the slow-wave microcontinuity of the EEG. *IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering*, 47(9), 1185-1194.

- For **MASS**, the citation is:
  > O’Reilly, C., Gosselin, N., Carrier, J., & Nielsen, T. (2014). Montreal archive of sleep studies: an open-access resource for instrument benchmarking and exploratory research. *Journal of Sleep Research*, 23(6), 628-635.

- For **SHHS**, the citation is:
  > Quan, S. F., Howard, B. V., Iber, C., Kiley, J. P., Nieto, F. J., O’Connor, G. T., Rapoport, D. M., Redline, S., Robbins, J., & Samet, J. M. (1997). The sleep heart health study: design, rationale, and methods. *Sleep*, 20(12), 1077-1085.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
