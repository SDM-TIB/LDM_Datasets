To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparative Study of Predicting Stock Index Using Deep Learning Models" by Harshal Patel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the study. The abstract mentions that the authors used the **NIFTY-50 dataset from Kaggle** to assess various forecasting models. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look into the **Research Methodology** section, specifically **section 2.1 (Dataset - Exploration)**, where the authors provide more details about the dataset. They describe the NIFTY 50 index as consisting of the closing values of stock indices from January 2011 to February 2022. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use in the study.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the NIFTY 50 dataset. However, since the dataset is sourced from Kaggle, I will need to provide a citation that reflects its origin. Kaggle datasets typically do not have formal citations like academic papers, but I can reference the Kaggle page for the NIFTY 50 dataset.

The citation for the NIFTY 50 dataset is:
> Kaggle. *NIFTY 50 Stock Market Dataset*. [Online]. Available: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/nifty-50-stock-market-dataset. Accessed: [insert access date].

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation.

In summary, the steps I took to extract the dataset were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Investigate the methodology section for detailed descriptions of the datasets.
3. Locate the full citation for the dataset in the references or through its source.

With this information, I can now create a complete entry for the NIFTY 50 dataset.
