To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Hybrid Approach to Measure Semantic Relatedness in Biomedical Concepts" by Katikapalli Subramanyam Kalyan and Sivanesan Sangeetha, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their hybrid approach on four publicly available datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the part where the authors discuss the datasets. In this section, they mention four datasets used for evaluation:

1. **MayoSRS**: This dataset is sourced from UMLS and contains 101 concept pairs with an annotation scale of 1-10. The percentage of multi-word concepts is 44%.

2. **UMNSRS-Rel**: Also sourced from UMLS, this dataset has 587 concept pairs with an annotation scale of 0-1600, and only 2% of the concepts are multi-word.

3. **UMNSRS-Sim**: This dataset, again from UMLS, includes 566 concept pairs with the same annotation scale as UMNSRS-Rel, and it also has 2% multi-word concepts.

4. **EHR-RelB**: This dataset is described as the largest publicly available relatedness dataset, containing 3630 concept pairs with an annotation scale of 0-3. Notably, 89% of the terms in this dataset are multi-word.

The authors emphasize that EHR-RelB is particularly challenging due to the high percentage of multi-word terms.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MayoSRS**, the citation is:
  > Pedersen, T., Pakhomov, S. V., Patwardhan, S., et al. (2007). Measures of semantic similarity and relatedness in the biomedical domain. *Journal of Biomedical Informatics*, 40(3), 288-299.

- For **UMNSRS-Rel** and **UMNSRS-Sim**, the citation is:
  > Pakhomov, S. V., Pedersen, T., McInnes, B., et al. (2011). Towards a framework for developing semantic relatedness reference standards. *Journal of Biomedical Informatics*, 44(2), 251-265.

- For **EHR-RelB**, the citation is:
  > Schulz, C., Levy-Kramer, J., Van Assel, C., et al. (2020). Biomedical Concept Relatednessâ€“A large EHR-based benchmark. In *Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Computational Linguistics* (pp. 6565-6575).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
