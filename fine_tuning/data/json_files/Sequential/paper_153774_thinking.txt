To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Class classification of vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts using AWD-LSTM" by Ajay K. Gogineni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of machine learning techniques for vulnerability detection in smart contracts, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly **section 2.1 (Data pre-processing)**, where the authors describe the dataset they used. Here, they mention that the smart contract data analyzed in the article is obtained from the work of Tann et al. This indicates that there is a specific dataset referenced.

In this section, the authors detail that the dataset consists of 892,913 distinct addresses labeled into five different types based on vulnerability categories. They specifically mention the types of vulnerabilities: Suicidal, Prodigal, Greedy, Normal, and a composite category. The authors also clarify that they processed 892,742 smart contracts, focusing on the first four types for their analysis.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors refer to the work of Tann et al. as the source of their dataset. The citation for this work is:

- Tann, A., Han, X. J., Gupta, S. S., & Ong, Y. S. (2018). *Towards safer smart contracts: A sequence learning approach to detecting vulnerabilities*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.06632.

Additionally, I will note that the authors mention using Google BigQuery to source the original data, which is relevant for understanding the dataset's origin.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the methods section, particularly the data preprocessing part, to identify the dataset used.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references for the dataset mentioned.

With this information, I will be able to create a comprehensive entry for the dataset used in the study.
