To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Quantum Search Decoder for Natural Language Processing" by Johannes Bausch et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions applying the quantum beam search decoder to Mozilla’s implementation of Baidu’s DeepSpeech neural net, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this application.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss experiments or applications of the proposed method. In the introduction, the authors reference the use of Mozilla’s DeepSpeech, which indicates that the dataset used for their experiments is likely related to this system.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for specific mentions of datasets. The authors state that they analyzed the output rank frequency of Mozilla’s DeepSpeech neural network and refer to the Mozilla Common Voice dataset, which consists of 3995 audio samples of spoken test sentences. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Mozilla Common Voice dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Mozilla. Common Voice. 2019.

Additionally, I will note that the paper discusses the output probabilities obtained from Mozilla’s DeepSpeech, which is based on the DeepSpeech model. However, since the DeepSpeech model itself is not a dataset but rather a system, I will focus on the Common Voice dataset as the primary dataset referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Mozilla Common Voice dataset in my output.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **Mozilla Common Voice Dataset**: A dataset consisting of 3995 audio samples of spoken test sentences.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Mozilla. Common Voice. 2019.

This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
