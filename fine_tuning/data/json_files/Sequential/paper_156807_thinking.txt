To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ECRTime: Ensemble Integration of Classification and Retrieval for Time Series Classification" by Fan Zhao and You Chen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **112 UCR datasets**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**. Here, the authors state that they evaluated their method on **112 datasets in the UCR univariate time series archive**. This is a clear indication that the UCR archive is the primary source of datasets used in their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the UCR archive, as it is essential to provide proper attribution for the datasets used. The UCR archive is referenced as follows:

- **UCR Time Series Archive**: 
  > H. A. Dau, A. Bagnall, K. Kamgar, C.-C. M. Yeh, Y. Zhu, S. Gharghabi, C. A. Ratanamahatana, E. Keogh. "The UCR Time Series Archive." IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica, 6(6), 1293â€“1305, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1109/JAS.2019.1911747.

Since the paper does not specify individual datasets from the UCR archive, I will note that the datasets are part of the larger collection available at the UCR archive.

Now, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets:

1. **UCR Time Series Archive**: This archive contains 112 datasets used for time series classification experiments in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name and its full citation, ensuring that all necessary information is included for proper referencing.
