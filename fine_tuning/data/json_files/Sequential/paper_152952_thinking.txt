To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Neural Architecture Search on Low-Dimensional Data for OCT Image Segmentation" by Nils Gessert and Alexander Schlaefer, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, but the methods section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used.

In the **methods section**, the authors mention using a publicly available OCT dataset with images from patients with mild age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and normal subjects. This indicates that a specific dataset is being utilized, and I need to gather more details about it.

Next, I will look for any specific names or identifiers for the dataset. The authors reference a study by Farsiu et al. (2014) that provides the dataset, which suggests that this is a well-known dataset in the field.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the OCT dataset, the citation is:
  > Sina Farsiu, Stephanie J Chiu, Rachelle V O’Connell, Francisco A Folgar, Eric Yuan, Joseph A Izatt, Cynthia A Toth, Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 Ancillary Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography Study Group, et al. *Quantitative classification of eyes with and without intermediate age-related macular degeneration using optical coherence tomography*. Ophthalmology, 121(1):162–172, 2014.

This citation provides the necessary details about the dataset, including the authors, title, journal, volume, issue, and page numbers.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation as it is crucial for proper attribution.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and completeness.
