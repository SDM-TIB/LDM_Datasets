To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scalable and Efficient Neural Speech Coding: A Hybrid Design" by Kai Zhen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and evaluation sections** of the paper. In these sections, the authors often describe the datasets used for training and testing their models. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

In the **data processing section**, the authors mention that the training dataset is created from the **TIMIT corpus**, which consists of 300 speakers contributing a total of 2.6 hours of training data. This is a clear indication of a dataset used in their research.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. For the TIMIT corpus, I will look for the original source or any relevant papers that describe the dataset in detail.

The citation for the TIMIT corpus is:
> Garofolo, J. S., Lamel, F. F., Fisher, W. M., Fiscus, J. G., Pallett, D. S., Dahlgren, N. L., & Zue, V. (1993). *TIMIT acoustic-phonetic continuous speech corpus*. Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
