To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Financial Market Trend Forecasting and Performance Analysis Using LSTM" by Jonghyeon Min, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the methodologies and datasets used. In this case, the introduction discusses the challenges of financial market forecasting and mentions the use of various financial data indicators, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Data Sets)**, as this section is specifically dedicated to datasets. Here, the author lists several indicators and data types used for analysis, including:

1. **PBR (Price Book Ratio)**: This is mentioned as a subsidiary indicator related to corporate value for fundamental analysis.
2. **PER (Price Earnings Ratio)**: Another key indicator for fundamental analysis.
3. **PSR (Price Sales Ratio)**: Also used in the context of corporate value analysis.
4. **Trading Volume**: This is used alongside adjusted prices and other indicators.
5. **Trend Deterministic Data (TDD)**: This data is derived from the difference between previous and current stock prices.

The section also discusses the use of normalized values for commodity price-related data, which indicates that the datasets are processed for analysis.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific external datasets or their citations, as it primarily discusses indicators derived from financial data rather than publicly available datasets.

Since the paper uses data from **Yahoo Finance** for stock prices and trading volumes, I will note that as a source. The relevant citation for this data source is:
> Yahoo Finance. *Yahoo Finance*. Retrieved from https://finance.yahoo.com (2017).

Additionally, the paper mentions using sentiment data extracted from social media and articles, which is processed using IBM Bluemix. The citation for this tool is:
> IBM Bluemix. *IBM Cloud Computing*. Retrieved from https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/ko (2017).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries and their citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that all relevant datasets and their sources are documented properly.
