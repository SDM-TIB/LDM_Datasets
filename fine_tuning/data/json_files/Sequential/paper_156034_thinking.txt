To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network Model for Citywide Air Pollution Forecasting" by Van-Duc Le et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the research involves a new dataset collected from Seoul city, which indicates that there is a dataset relevant to the study.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss their previous research and the need for a larger dataset. They mention that they have collected data from 2015 to 2019, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, specifically section 4.1, the authors provide detailed statistics about the new Seoul dataset, including the time period and the types of data it contains. They compare the new dataset with the existing one, highlighting that the new dataset is 75% larger and includes various air quality and meteorological factors.

I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **Seoul Dataset (2015-2019)**: This dataset includes air pollution values from monitoring stations in Seoul, meteorological data, traffic volume, average driving speed, and external air pollution data from nearby regions in China. The dataset spans five years and is significantly larger than previous datasets.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the original dataset mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to their previous work, which is likely where the original dataset was first introduced.

The citation for the original dataset is:
> Van-Duc Le, Tien-Cuong Bui, and Sang-Kyun Cha. *Spatiotemporal Deep Learning Model for Citywide Air Pollution Interpolation and Prediction*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing (BigComp), 2020.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
