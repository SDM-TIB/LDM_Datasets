        "dcterms:description": "The dataset is generated based on traditional rate-and-state friction equations, specifically using the aging law for state evolution. It consists of 15000 random sequences simulating diverse frictional sliding scenarios, each designed to reflect a total sliding distance of 30Dc and completed within 0.013 seconds. The dataset includes features representing the velocity protocol sampled at 100 equally-spaced instants and targets corresponding to variations of the friction coefficient sequence at these same instants.",
