To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Universal Adversarial Perturbations for Speech Recognition Systems" by Paarth Neekhara et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of universal adversarial perturbations and mentions the application of their technique on the Mozilla DeepSpeech ASR system, which suggests that datasets related to this system might be involved.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experimental details** sections, as these typically contain explicit references to the datasets used for training and evaluation. In the **experimental details** section, the authors mention that they trained their algorithm on the **Mozilla Common Voice Dataset**, which contains 582 hours of audio across 400,000 recordings in English. This is a key dataset for their experiments.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **results** or **discussion** sections. However, the primary focus appears to be on the Mozilla Common Voice Dataset, as it is the main dataset used for training the universal adversarial perturbations.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Mozilla Common Voice Dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Mozilla. *Common Voice*. [Online]. Available: https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction process:

1. **Mozilla Common Voice Dataset**: This dataset is used for training the universal adversarial perturbations. It consists of 582 hours of audio across 400,000 recordings in English.

Now, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Mozilla Common Voice Dataset in my final output.
