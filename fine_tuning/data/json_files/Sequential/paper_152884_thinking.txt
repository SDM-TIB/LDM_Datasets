To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VayuAnukulani: Adaptive Memory Networks for Air Pollution Forecasting" by Divyam Madaan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions that the authors forecast air quality for five prominent locations in Delhi based on historical and real-time data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). This indicates that there is a dataset involved, specifically related to air quality monitoring.

Next, I will focus on the **data collection section** (Section V) where the authors describe the data sources in detail. They state that they collected air quality data, meteorological data, and time data from five air quality monitoring sites in Delhi. The pollutants mentioned include SO2, NO2, PM2.5, PM10, CO, and O3, along with meteorological parameters like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and barometric pressure.

In this section, the authors also mention that the data was sourced from the **Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)**, which is a significant dataset for air quality monitoring in India. They highlight that CPCB has 703 operating stations across various cities, with 78 located in Delhi.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the CPCB dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, but they reference the CPCB website, which is crucial for accessing the data.

The citation for the CPCB dataset can be formatted as follows:
> Central Pollution Control Board. *Air Quality Data*. Available at: http://cpcb.nic.in/

Additionally, I will note that the paper mentions the use of historical data collected over a period of 1-3 years for the five locations, but does not specify individual datasets beyond the CPCB data.

Finally, I will summarize the findings:
1. **CPCB Air Quality Dataset**: This dataset includes air quality measurements for pollutants such as SO2, NO2, PM2.5, PM10, CO, and O3, along with meteorological data from five monitoring stations in Delhi.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
