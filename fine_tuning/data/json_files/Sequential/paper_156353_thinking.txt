To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Energy-Based Models for Speech Synthesis" by Wanli Sun, Zehai Tu, and Anton Ragni, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various models for speech synthesis but do not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed.

In **section 4.1 (Experimental setup)**, the authors mention the **LJSpeech dataset**. They describe it as containing 13,100 audio clips totaling approximately 24 hours from one female speaker. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets, which is important for understanding its structure.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the LJSpeech dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

> Keith Ito and Linda Johnson, “The LJ Speech Dataset,” https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/, 2017.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **LJSpeech Dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation in the experiments. It consists of 13,100 audio clips from a single female speaker, totaling around 24 hours of speech. The dataset is divided into training (10,000 clips), validation (1,800 clips), and test (1,300 clips) sets.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation is included for the LJSpeech dataset.
