It was compiled from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of 25 healthy subjects across multiple sessions to capture various intuitive movement tasks associated with the arms, hands, and wrists. The dataset comprises 82,500 trials across all subjects, averaging approximately 3,300 trials per subject.",
