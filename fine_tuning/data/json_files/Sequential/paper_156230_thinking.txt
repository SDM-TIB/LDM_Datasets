To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SwinLSTM: Improving Spatiotemporal Prediction Accuracy using Swin Transformer and LSTM" by Song Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or mentions of datasets. The introduction highlights the importance of spatiotemporal prediction and mentions that the proposed model was evaluated on multiple datasets, which I will need to identify.

I will then focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors explicitly list the datasets they evaluated their model on:

1. **Moving MNIST**: A synthetic dataset used for evaluating video prediction models. The authors describe it as containing sequences of moving handwritten digits.

2. **Human3.6m**: A dataset containing 3.6 million different human poses and corresponding images, specifically focusing on the 'walking' scenario for their experiments.

3. **KTH**: A dataset that includes videos of individuals performing various human actions, which the authors resized for their experiments.

4. **TaxiBJ**: A dataset consisting of real-world taxi trajectory data collected from GPS monitors in Beijing, used for predicting traffic flow.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Moving MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Nitish Srivastava, Elman Mansimov, and Ruslan Salakhudinov. *Unsupervised learning of video representations using lstms*. In International conference on machine learning, pages 843–852. PMLR, 2015.

- For **Human3.6m**, the citation is:
  > Catalin Ionescu, Dragos Papava, Vlad Olaru, and Cristian Sminchisescu. *Human3. 6m: Large scale datasets and predictive methods for 3d human sensing in natural environments*. IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence, 36(7):1325–1339, 2013.

- For **KTH**, the citation is:
  > Christian Schuldt, Ivan Laptev, and Barbara Caputo. *Recognizing human actions: a local svm approach*. In Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Pattern Recognition, 2004. ICPR 2004., volume 3, pages 32–36. IEEE, 2004.

- For **TaxiBJ**, the citation is:
  > Junbo Zhang, Yu Zheng, and Dekang Qi. *Deep spatio-temporal residual networks for citywide crowd flows prediction*. In Thirty-first AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
