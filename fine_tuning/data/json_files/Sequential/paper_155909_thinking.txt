To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A comparative study of statistical and machine learning models on near-real-time daily emissions prediction" by Xiangqian Li, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses **univariate daily time-series data** from January 1st, 2020, to September 30th, 2022, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.1 (Data description)**, where the author describes the dataset in detail. Here, it is stated that the data is collected from the **Carbon Monitor project** and consists of **1004 daily near-real-time time series of China’s carbon dioxide emissions** across various sectors (Power, Industry, Ground Transport, Residential, Domestic Aviation, and International Aviation). This section provides the necessary details about the dataset's scope and timeframe.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Carbon Monitor project, which is crucial for proper attribution. The relevant citation is:

- **Carbon Monitor project**: Liu, Z., et al. "Carbon Monitor, a near-real-time daily dataset of global CO2 emission from fossil fuel and cement production." *Scientific Data*, 7 (2020) 392.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Dataset Name**: Carbon Monitor Project
   - **Description**: A dataset containing 1004 daily near-real-time time series of China’s carbon dioxide emissions from January 1st, 2020, to September 30th, 2022, covering multiple sectors.
   - **Citation**: Liu, Z., et al. "Carbon Monitor, a near-real-time daily dataset of global CO2 emission from fossil fuel and cement production." *Scientific Data*, 7 (2020) 392.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and provided the necessary citations for proper acknowledgment in future work.
