To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dimensionality Reduction and Motion Clustering during Activities of Daily Living: 3, 4, and 7 Degree-of-Freedom Arm Movements" by Yuri Gloumakov et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets or prior works that might include datasets relevant to their study. The introduction discusses the need for representative arm joint angle trajectories and mentions the use of data-driven approaches, which suggests that they likely utilized specific datasets for their experiments.

In the **methods section**, particularly under **Data Acquisition**, the authors describe how they recorded motions using a Vicon Motion Capture System. This indicates that the data collected during the experiments is a primary dataset. I will note the details about the number of subjects and the types of tasks performed, as this information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets or provide insights into how the data was analyzed. They discuss clustering and the results of their analysis, which may include references to the datasets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or methodologies referenced in the paper. This is important for providing proper attribution and context for the datasets.

For example, if the authors reference a specific dataset like the AM-ULA (Activities Measure for Upper Limb Amputees), I will ensure to find the full citation for that dataset. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their descriptions and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for further processing or review.
