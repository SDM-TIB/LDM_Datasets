To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Representations with End-to-End Models for Improved Remaining Useful Life Prognostic" by Alaaeddine Chaoub et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed model is tested on the **NASA commercial modular aero-propulsion system simulation (C-MAPSS) dataset**, which indicates that this is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (The C-MAPSS Dataset overview)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. They explain that the C-MAPSS dataset is generated using a simulation program that monitors the degradation of multiple turbofan engines. The dataset is divided into four subsets (FD001 to FD004), each with different operating conditions and fault modes. This section confirms that the C-MAPSS dataset is the primary dataset used for the experiments.

In this section, the authors also provide specific details about the dataset, such as the number of training and test trajectories, the number of operating conditions, and the fault modes for each subset. This information is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's structure and usage.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the C-MAPSS dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **C-MAPSS Dataset**:

Since the paper primarily focuses on the C-MAPSS dataset, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that the full citation is included, and prepare it for structured output as required.
