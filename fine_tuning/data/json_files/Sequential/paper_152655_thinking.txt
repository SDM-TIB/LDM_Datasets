To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-cell LSTM Based Neural Language Model" by Thomas Cherian, Akshay Badola, and Vineet Padmanabhan, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed model on the Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Results and Observations)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. They describe the Penn Treebank dataset in detail, noting its origin and structure. The paper states that they used a variant of the original dataset distributed with the Chainer package for their experiments, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

In this section, the authors provide specific details about the dataset:
- The Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset is originally a corpus of English sentences with linguistic structure annotations, consisting of 2,499 stories sampled from the Wall Street Journal collection. The dataset is divided into training, test, and validation sets with specific word counts.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Penn Treebank dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Marcus, M., Kim, G., Marcinkiewicz, M. A., MacIntyre, R., Bies, A., Ferguson, M., Katz, K., & Schasberger, B. (1994). The Penn Treebank: Annotating predicate argument structure. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Human Language Technology, HLT ’94, pages 114–119. Association for Computational Linguistics.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset:

1. **Penn Treebank (PTB) Dataset**: A corpus of English sentences with linguistic structure annotations, consisting of 2,499 stories from the Wall Street Journal. The dataset is divided into training, test, and validation sets with a total vocabulary of 10,000 words.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included.
