To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Long Short-Term Memory Networks" by Ketaki Joshi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of their approach on LSTM networks for computer memory access prefetching and natural language processing, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 5), where the authors describe their methodology for evaluating their approach. Here, they mention using synthetic sequences for the memory access prefetching task, but I need to confirm if any specific datasets are referenced.

In the **language modeling section** of the experimental setup, the authors explicitly mention using the **Penn Tree Bank (PTB)** dataset for their word-level prediction task. They provide details about the dataset, including its vocabulary size and the number of training and test words, which confirms its relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Penn Tree Bank dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Mitchell P. Marcus, Beatrice Santorini, and Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2):313–330, 1993.

Additionally, while the authors describe synthetic sequences for the memory access prefetching task, they do not provide a formal dataset citation for these synthetic sequences, as they are generated for the purpose of the study.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Penn Tree Bank dataset, as it is crucial for proper attribution.

In summary, the identified dataset is:
1. **Penn Tree Bank (PTB)**: Used for language modeling tasks.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Mitchell P. Marcus, Beatrice Santorini, and Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2):313–330, 1993.

With this information, I am ready to create the dataset entries for further processing.
