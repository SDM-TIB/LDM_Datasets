To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MaxUp: A Simple Way to Improve Generalization of Neural Network Training" by Chengyue Gong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses testing MaxUp on various tasks, including image classification and language modeling, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically provide details about the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention testing MaxUp on three challenging tasks: image classification, language modeling, and adversarial certification. 

1. **ImageNet Dataset**: The authors state that they evaluate MaxUp on the ILSVRC2012 subset of the ImageNet dataset, which contains around 1.3 million training images and 50,000 validation images. This is a well-known dataset in the field of computer vision.

2. **CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 Datasets**: The authors also mention testing MaxUp on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, which are standard datasets for image classification tasks. CIFAR-10 consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, while CIFAR-100 has the same number of images but divided into 100 classes.

3. **Penn Treebank (PTB) Dataset**: For language modeling, the authors use the Penn Treebank dataset, which consists of 923k training, 73k validation, and 82k test words. This dataset is commonly used for benchmarking language models.

4. **Wikitext-2 (WT2) Dataset**: The authors also mention using the Wikitext-2 dataset, which contains pre-processed Wikipedia articles and has a training set of 2 million words.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., and Fei-Fei, L. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In CVPR, pp. 248â€“255. IEEE, 2009.

- For **CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **Penn Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Marcus, M., Santorini, B., and Marcinkiewicz, M. A. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. 1993.

- For **Wikitext-2**, the citation is:
  > Merity, S., Keskar, N. S., and Socher, R. *Regularizing and Optimizing LSTM Language Models*. ICLR, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
