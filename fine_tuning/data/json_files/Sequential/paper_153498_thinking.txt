To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Order Matters at Fanatics: Recommending Sequentially Ordered Products by LSTM embedded with Word2Vec" by Jing Pan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the work. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the experiments conducted, including any datasets utilized. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, the authors discuss a recommender system that utilizes a large number of product IDs (approximately half a million). However, they do not explicitly name any publicly available datasets. Instead, they describe their own dataset derived from user purchase history at Fanatics, which is not a standard dataset that can be cited.

Since the paper does not provide full citations for any external datasets, I will note that the dataset used is proprietary to Fanatics and does not have a formal citation. However, I will still document the dataset as follows:

1. **Fanatics Purchase History Dataset**: This dataset consists of user purchase sequences, including product IDs and timestamps, used to train the recommender system. The dataset is proprietary and not publicly available.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly indicate the proprietary nature of the dataset and the lack of a formal citation. This will help maintain clarity regarding the source and availability of the data used in the research.
