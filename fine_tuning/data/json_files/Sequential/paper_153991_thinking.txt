To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differentially-private Federated Neural Architecture Search" by Ishika Singh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of federated learning and neural architecture search, which suggests that datasets are involved, particularly in the context of training and validation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of using sensitive data for machine learning and mention that each party has a labeled dataset \(D_k\) containing input data and labels. This indicates that there are multiple datasets, but I need to identify their specific names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments sections**. In the methods section, the authors describe the datasets as being labeled and sensitive, but they do not provide specific names or citations yet.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for their experiments, which is a well-known dataset for image classification tasks. They specify that the dataset consists of 60,000 images across 10 classes, with 50,000 for training and 10,000 for testing. This is a clear indication of a dataset used in their work.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset is typically attributed to the following source:

- For **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2010. Available at: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

Since the paper does not mention any other specific datasets by name, I will conclude that the CIFAR-10 dataset is the primary dataset referenced in this research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for CIFAR-10, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will allow me to present the information in a structured manner for further processing or review.
