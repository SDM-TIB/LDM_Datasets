To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sentiment Analysis of Persian Language: Review of Algorithms, Approaches and Datasets" by Ali Nazarizadeh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets along with their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to get an overview of the paper's focus and to identify any datasets that may be mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper reviews various datasets used in sentiment analysis for the Persian language, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any subsections that discuss datasets used in the studies reviewed. In this paper, there is a section titled **5.1 Datasets**, which appears to provide detailed descriptions of the datasets referenced throughout the paper. I will carefully read this section to extract the names and descriptions of each dataset.

As I extract the datasets, I will note the following details for each one:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its contents and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of comments, classes).
3. **Citation**: The full citation for the original source of the dataset, which is crucial for proper attribution.

From the **5.1 Datasets** section, I will compile the following datasets:

1. **Digikala and Hellokish**: This dataset contains 1500 positive and 1500 negative comments from Digikala, and 1800 positive and 1800 negative hotel reviews from Hellokish.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided in the dataset description, but referenced in the paper.

2. **SentiPers**: A sentiment analysis corpus for Persian containing 26,000 annotations, with scores ranging from -2 to +2.
   - Citation: Hosseini, P., Ahmadian, R. A., Maleki, H., Anvari, M., & Mirroshandel, S. A. (2018). *SentiPers: A Sentiment Analysis Corpus for Persian*. arXiv:1801.07737.

3. **Pars-ABSA**: This dataset includes user feedback on products and services, with 5,114 positive, 3,061 negative, and 1,827 neutral comments.
   - Citation: Shangipour, A. T., Darvishi, K., Javdan, S., Minaei-Bidgoli, B., & Eetemadi, S. (2019). *Pars-ABSA: an Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis dataset for Persian*. arXiv:1908.01815.

4. **Persian Hotel Reviews**: A dataset containing 761 documents with various sentiment classes.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided in the dataset description, but referenced in the paper.

5. **Iranian Stock Market Dataset**: Contains 2,125 bearish and 6,248 bullish comments collected from a stock market social network.
   - Citation: Hatefi, G. A., & Shamsfard, M. (2020). *Tehran Stock Exchange Prediction Using Sentiment Analysis of Online Textual Opinions*. Intell. Sys. Acc. Fin. Mgmt.

6. **MirasOpinion**: This database includes user comments from the Digikala site, with a total of 93,000 unlabeled comments.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided in the dataset description, but referenced in the paper.

7. **Insta-Text**: Contains 9,000 comments from Instagram, labeled in three categories.
   - Citation: Heidari, M., & Shamsinejad, P. (2020). *Producing An Instagram Dataset for Persian Language Sentiment Analysis Using Crowdsourcing Method*. 2020 6th International Conference on Web Research (ICWR).

After gathering all the necessary information, I will ensure that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for proper attribution. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in sentiment analysis for the Persian language as discussed in the paper.
