To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning for Multilingual Task Oriented Dialog" by Sebastian Schuster et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions a new dataset of **57k annotated utterances** in English, Spanish, and Thai, which indicates that there is a significant dataset involved.

Next, I will look into the **Data section** (section 2) where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they describe the dataset as containing **57,000 utterances** across three languages (English, Spanish, and Thai) and across three domains (weather, alarm, and reminder). They also provide statistics about the number of utterances in each language and domain, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

In this section, I will note the specific breakdown of the utterances:
- **English**: 43,000 utterances
- **Spanish**: 8,600 utterances
- **Thai**: 5,000 utterances

The authors also mention that the dataset is annotated according to the same guidelines, which is important for ensuring consistency across languages.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors state that the dataset is publicly available at a specific URL: https://fb.me/multilingual_task_oriented_data. However, they do not provide a formal citation for the dataset in the references, which is common for datasets that are released online.

Since the dataset is a new contribution of the paper, I will create a citation entry for it based on the authors and the title of the paper. The citation will look like this:

> Schuster, S., Gupta, S., Shah, R., & Lewis, M. (2023). *Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning for Multilingual Task Oriented Dialog*. Retrieved from https://fb.me/multilingual_task_oriented_data.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and the full citation.

In summary, I have identified the dataset as follows:
1. **Dataset Name**: Multilingual Task Oriented Dialog Dataset
2. **Description**: A dataset of 57,000 annotated utterances in English (43k), Spanish (8.6k), and Thai (5k) across the domains of weather, alarm, and reminder.
3. **Citation**: Schuster, S., Gupta, S., Shah, R., & Lewis, M. (2023). *Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning for Multilingual Task Oriented Dialog*. Retrieved from https://fb.me/multilingual_task_oriented_data.

With this information, I am ready to create the final output that includes the dataset details and citation.
