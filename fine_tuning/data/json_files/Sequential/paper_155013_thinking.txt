To extract datasets from the research paper titled "College Student Retention Risk Analysis From Educational Database using Multi-Task Multi-Modal Neural Fusion" by Mohammad Arif Ul Alam, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data description sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their model on a large educational database consisting of 36,445 college students, which suggests that this database is a key dataset.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Data Description)**, where the author provides detailed information about the dataset. Here, I find that the dataset consists of 36,445 undergraduate students from a private university in a third-world country. The section describes the gender distribution, dropout rates, and the categorization of dropout causes, which are crucial details about the dataset.

The paper also mentions that the dataset includes demographic data, temporal performance data, and advising notes, which are essential components of the dataset. I will note these aspects as they contribute to the overall understanding of the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from a private university and not published in a separate paper, there may not be a formal citation available. Instead, I will summarize the dataset's details as follows:

1. **Educational Database**: A dataset consisting of 36,445 undergraduate students from a private university in a third-world country, including demographic data, temporal performance data, and advising notes. The dataset provides insights into student retention risks, dropout causes, and performance metrics.

Since there is no formal citation for this dataset, I will note that it is an internal dataset from the university and cannot be cited in the traditional sense.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that captures the essence of the dataset, ensuring that I highlight its significance in the context of the research conducted in the paper.
