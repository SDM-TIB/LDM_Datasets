To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Architectures, Data and Units for Streaming End-to-End Speech Recognition with RNN-Transducer" by Kanishka Rao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses training end-to-end speech recognition models and mentions the use of transcribed acoustic data, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 4), where the authors detail the data used for training their models. Here, they mention that the acoustic model is trained on a set of approximately **22 million hand-transcribed anonymized utterances** extracted from Google US English voice traffic, which corresponds to about **18,000 hours of training data**. This indicates a significant dataset used for the experiments.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **results section** or **conclusion** that might provide further insights into the datasets used. However, the primary dataset appears to be the one mentioned in the experimental setup.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. Since the dataset is derived from Google US English voice traffic, it may not have a formal citation like a published dataset, but I will note the context in which it is used.

The citation for the dataset can be summarized as follows:
- **Google US English Voice Traffic Dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately 22 million hand-transcribed anonymized utterances, which were used for training the acoustic model in the study.

Since this dataset is not formally published in a separate paper, I will note it as a proprietary dataset from Google.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the context and citation, ensuring that it is clear and complete for any future reference or processing.
