To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Adaptive Task Offloading in Edge Computing based on Meta Reinforcement Learning" by Jin Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (which is often where datasets are detailed). In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup, including the generation of synthetic Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to simulate various applications. This indicates that the datasets are not traditional datasets but rather generated data based on specific parameters.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for details about the datasets, including how they were generated, their characteristics, and any specific parameters used. The authors mention that they generated synthetic DAGs according to real-world applications, covering a wide range of topologies, task numbers, and transmission rates. This suggests that the datasets are created dynamically based on certain criteria.

I will also check the **references section** to see if there are any citations related to the methods or frameworks used to generate these datasets. If the authors refer to any specific methodologies or previous works that describe the dataset generation process, I will note those citations as well.

From the paper, I can identify the following datasets:

1. **Synthetic DAGs**: The authors generated synthetic DAGs to simulate various applications, with parameters controlling topologies and task profiles. This dataset is not a traditional dataset with a citation but is crucial for understanding the experiments.

2. **Training and Testing Datasets**: The paper mentions that the generated datasets are separated into "training datasets" and "testing datasets." However, specific citations for these datasets are not provided since they are generated based on the authors' methodology.

Since the datasets are generated rather than sourced from existing datasets, I will note that the authors did not provide traditional citations for these datasets. Instead, I will summarize the dataset generation process and the parameters used.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to highlight the nature of the datasets and the lack of traditional citations while summarizing the generation methodology.

In conclusion, while the paper does not provide traditional datasets with citations, it describes the generation of synthetic datasets based on specific parameters, which is essential for understanding the experimental results.
