To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hand gesture recognition using 802.11ad mmWave sensor in the mobile device" by Yuwei Ren et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their architecture on a "large multi-person dataset," which suggests that a specific dataset is used, but I need to find more details.

Next, I will look into **section III (System Design and Theoretical Model)**, particularly the subsection titled **B. Sequence frame dropping and recovery**. Here, the authors mention that they built a self-contained dataset with 21 participants, which is a crucial detail. They state that this dataset contains more than 20,000 sequences, each lasting roughly 60 seconds. This indicates the dataset's size and the nature of the data collected.

I will also check the **experiments section** (though not explicitly labeled in the provided text) to see if there are any additional details about the dataset's use or characteristics. The authors mention the performance evaluation of their models, but they do not provide further specifics about the dataset in this section.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the dataset:

1. **Self-contained dataset**: This dataset was created for the purpose of the study, involving 21 participants of varying genders, ages, and weights. It consists of over 20,000 sequences, each approximately 60 seconds long.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, since this dataset appears to be original and created by the authors for their experiments, it may not have a formal citation like established datasets. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is proprietary to this research.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information, ensuring to include the details about the dataset's creation and its characteristics, while also noting that it does not have a formal citation since it is an original dataset.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare to format it according to the required structure, ensuring clarity and completeness in the dataset description.
