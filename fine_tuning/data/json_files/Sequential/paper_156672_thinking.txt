To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine Learning-based NLP for Emotion Classification on a Cholera X Dataset" by Paul Jideani and Aurona Gerber, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that a dataset of **23,000 posts** was extracted and pre-processed, which suggests that this is a key dataset for the study.

Next, I will look closely at the **materials and methods section** where the authors describe the dataset collection process. They mention using the **Twitter API** to extract tweets related to the cholera outbreak using specific hashtags. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including the number of tweets collected and the time frame of the data collection (from April 2023 to July 2023).

In the **results section**, the authors analyze the emotions expressed in the dataset, confirming that the dataset consists of **23,000 tweets**. They also provide insights into the emotional distribution of these tweets, which further emphasizes the dataset's significance.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset mentioned in the paper. The dataset is derived from Twitter posts, and while the authors do not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself, I can reference the original source of the data collection:

- For the **Cholera X Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jideani, P., & Gerber, A. (2023). Machine Learning-based NLP for Emotion Classification on a Cholera X Dataset. *[Journal Name]*, *[Volume]*, *[Page Numbers]*. [DOI or URL if available].

Since the dataset is based on tweets, I will also note that the data is publicly available through the Twitter API, but specific citations for individual tweets are not typically provided in academic papers.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset entry:
1. **Cholera X Dataset**: A dataset of 23,000 tweets collected using the Twitter API, focusing on public sentiment regarding the cholera outbreak in Hammanskraal, South Africa.

After gathering this information, I will prepare to format the dataset entry according to the required structure for further processing.
