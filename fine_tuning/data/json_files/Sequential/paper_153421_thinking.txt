To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-Local ConvLSTM for Video Compression Artifact Reduction" by Yi Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on **two datasets**, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Settings)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe:

1. **Vimeo-90K**: This is a large-scale video dataset specifically designed for low-level video processing. The authors mention that all frames are resized to a fixed resolution of 448 Ã— 256 and that compressed clips were generated using x265 in FFmpeg with specific quantization parameters.

2. **Yang et al.'s dataset**: This dataset consists of 70 video sequences selected from other datasets, with varying resolutions. The authors specify that 60 sequences are used for training and 10 for testing, and they provide details about the encoding settings used.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Vimeo-90K**, the citation is:
  > Xue, T., Chen, B., Wu, J., Wei, D., & Freeman, W. T. (2019). Video enhancement with task-oriented flow. *International Journal of Computer Vision*, 127(8), 1106-1125.

- For **Yang et al.'s dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yang, R., Xu, M., & Wang, Z. (2018). Multi-frame quality enhancement for compressed video. In *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*, 6664-6673.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
