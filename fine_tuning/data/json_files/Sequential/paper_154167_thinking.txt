To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph-to-Sequence Neural Machine Translation" by Sufeng Duan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two translation tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In this case, they describe two datasets:

1. **IWSLT14 German-English Dataset**: This dataset contains 153K training sentence pairs, with a validation set derived from the training set and a test set comprising several specific datasets. The authors mention preprocessing steps and the use of a BPE algorithm.

2. **WMT14 English-German Dataset**: This dataset consists of 4.5M sentence pairs for training, with specific validation and test sets mentioned. The authors also describe preprocessing steps and the removal of sentences longer than 250 tokens.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **IWSLT14 German-English Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cettolo, M., Girardi, C., & Federico, M. (2012). *WIT3: Web Inventory of Transcribed and Translated Talks*. In Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC).

- For the **WMT14 English-German Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bojar, O., & Tamchyna, A. (2014). *The 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation: Proceedings of the Conference*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
