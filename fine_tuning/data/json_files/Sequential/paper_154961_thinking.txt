To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Regularizing Transformers With Deep Probabilistic Layers" by Aurora Cobo Aguilera et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (GMVAE) and its application in various models, which may imply the use of specific datasets for evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, I will specifically look for sections that discuss the datasets in detail, such as **section 3 (GMVAE as a regularizer in deep neural networks)** and **section 5 (Results)**. 

In **section 3**, the authors mention using the **Fashion MNIST** dataset for a basic example of applying their method. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its structure and the number of samples used.

In **section 5**, the authors discuss the **SNLI** dataset, which is used for evaluating their model's performance in terms of accuracy and BLEU score. I will extract the relevant details about this dataset, including the number of sentences in the training and test sets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The citations I will look for include:

1. For **Fashion MNIST**:
   > Xiao H, Rasul K, Vollgraf R. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

2. For **SNLI**:
   > Bowman S, Angeli G, Potts C, Manning CD. *A Large Annotated Corpus for Learning Natural Language Inference*. In: Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. 2015. p. 632â€“42.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their descriptions and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and use in future analyses or applications.
