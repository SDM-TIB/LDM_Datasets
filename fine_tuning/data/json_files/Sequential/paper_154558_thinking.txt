To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Delhi air quality prediction using LSTM deep learning models with a focus on COVID-19 lockdown" by Animesh Tiwari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on air quality prediction in Delhi, which suggests that there may be specific datasets related to air quality measurements.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Methodology)**, where the authors describe the data collection process. They mention that the air pollution dataset was collected from the **Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)** in India, which is a key dataset for this study. I will note the details provided about the dataset, including the parameters measured and the time frame of the data collection.

In **section 3.1**, the authors specify that they used data from four monitoring stations in Delhi: **Anand Vihar, Bawana, Delhi Technical University (DTU), and Vivek Vihar**. They provide a detailed description of the parameters measured, such as PM2.5, PM10, nitrogen oxides, and others, along with their ranges and means. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and content.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CPCB dataset. Since the dataset is sourced from a government agency, I will ensure to include the official website link for the CPCB as part of the citation.

The key datasets identified are:

1. **Air Quality Dataset from CPCB**: This dataset includes measurements from four monitoring stations in Delhi, covering various air quality parameters over a specified time period.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as follows:

- For the **CPCB dataset**, the citation is:
  > Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Government of India. *Air Quality Data*. Available at: https://app.cpcbccr.com/ccr/#/caaqm-dashboard/caaqm-landing

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured and cited.
