To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Voice Disorder Detection Using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Model" by Vibhuti Gupta, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not explicitly mention datasets. However, the introduction discusses the use of a dataset from the Far Eastern Memorial Hospital (FEMH) for voice disorder detection, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Method)**, where the author describes the dataset in detail. The paper states that the dataset comprises 200 training samples and 400 testing samples, with specific details about the types of voice disorders included. The training dataset consists of 50 normal voice samples and 150 samples of various voice disorders, including glottis neoplasm, Phonotrauma, and vocal paralysis.

In this section, the author also mentions that the dataset is part of the FEMH voice disorder detection challenge, which is crucial for identifying the dataset's source.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the FEMH dataset. The paper cites the FEMH challenge as a source, but it does not provide a detailed citation format. Therefore, I will need to construct a citation based on the information provided in the text and the URL mentioned.

The citation for the FEMH dataset is:
> FEMH challenge. Accessed August 2018, URL: https://femh-challenge2018.weebly.com/

Since the paper does not provide additional datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

The dataset entry will include:
1. The name of the dataset: **FEMH Voice Disorder Detection Dataset**
2. A description of the dataset: It includes 50 normal voice samples and 150 samples of common voice disorders (glottis neoplasm, Phonotrauma, and vocal paralysis).
3. The full citation for the dataset.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
