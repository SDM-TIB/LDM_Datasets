To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AS-ES Learning: Towards Efficient CoT Learning in Small Models" by Nuwa Xi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses a new training paradigm and mentions experiments on two tasks: Math Word Problems (MWP) and PET report summarization. This indicates that datasets related to these tasks are likely included.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Math Word Problems (MWP)**: The dataset is curated by Fu et al. (2023) and consists of chain-of-thought data generated by the code-davinci-002 model from OpenAI, sourced from the GSM8K dataset. This dataset is specifically mentioned as being enhanced with in-context examples.

2. **cPET-11K Dataset**: This is a novel compilation of 11.6k Chinese PET/CT report-impression pairs, derived from real clinical data of patients with pancreatic cancer. The authors emphasize that the dataset is anonymized and focuses on determining the presence of pancreatic cancer and its metastasis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Math Word Problems (MWP)** dataset, the citation is:
  > Yao Fu, Hao Peng, Litu Ou, Ashish Sabharwal, and Tushar Khot. *Specializing smaller language models towards multi-step reasoning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2301.12726, 2023.

- For the **cPET-11K Dataset**, since it is a novel dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:
  > Nuwa Xi, Yuhan Chen, Sendong Zhao, Haochun Wang, Bing Qin, and Ting Liu. *AS-ES Learning: Towards Efficient CoT Learning in Small Models*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year]. (Note: Replace with actual conference name and year if available).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations as required.
