To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Nepali Video Captioning using CNN-RNN Architecture" by Bipesh Subedi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves dataset collection and mentions enriching the **MSVD dataset** with Nepali captions. This suggests that the MSVD dataset is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look into the **Methodology** section, specifically the **Dataset Collection** subsection, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention the **MSVD dataset**, describing it as comprising 1970 distinct videos with over 80,000 text descriptions. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides additional context about its structure.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MSVD dataset. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

- For the **MSVD dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chen, D. L., & Dolan, W. B. (2011). Collecting Highly Parallel Data for Paraphrase Evaluation. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL-2011).

Additionally, I will note that the authors mention using Google Translate to enrich the dataset with Nepali captions, but this does not constitute a separate dataset. Therefore, I will focus solely on the MSVD dataset for my extraction.

After gathering all necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper referencing. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the dataset used in the research paper.
