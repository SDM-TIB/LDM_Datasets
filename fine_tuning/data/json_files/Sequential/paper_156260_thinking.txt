To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SymED: Adaptive and Online Symbolic Representation of Data on the Edge" by Daniel Hofst√§tter et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method using datasets from the UCR Time Series Classification Archive, which indicates that there are specific datasets used for their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup in section 4.1, where they mention using datasets from the UCR Time Series Classification Archive. They filtered the datasets to include only those with a minimum length of 1000 data points.

I will then carefully read through the **table** presented in section 4.1, which lists the selected datasets. The table includes the following datasets:

1. **ACSF1**: Size: 10, Length: 1460
2. **CinCECGTorso**: Size: 4, Length: 1639
3. **EOGHorizontalSignal**: Size: 12, Length: 1250
4. **EOGVerticalSignal**: Size: 12, Length: 1250
5. **EthanolLevel**: Size: 4, Length: 1751
6. **HandOutlines**: Size: 2, Length: 2709
7. **Haptics**: Size: 2, Length: 1092
8. **HouseTwenty**: Size: 7, Length: 2000
9. **InlineSkate**: Size: 8, Length: 1024
10. **Mallat**: Size: 5, Length: 1024
11. **MixedShapesRegularTrain**: Size: 5, Length: 1024
12. **MixedShapesSmallTrain**: Size: 5, Length: 1344
13. **PLAID**: Size: 2, Length: 1024
14. **Phoneme**: Size: 39, Length: 2000
15. **Hemodynamics**: Size: 52, Length: 2000
16. **PigAirwayPressure**: Size: 52, Length: 2000
17. **PigArtPressure**: Size: 52, Length: 2000
18. **PigCVP**: Size: 52, Length: 2844
19. **Rock**: Size: 4, Length: 1500
20. **SemgHandGenderCh2**: Size: 1500, Length: 1500
21. **SemgHandMovementCh2**: Size: 1500, Length: 1500
22. **SemgHandSubjectCh2**: Size: 1024, Length: 1024
23. **StarLightCurves**: Size: 4, Length: 1024

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. The paper cites the UCR Time Series Classification Archive as the source of the datasets. The citation for this archive is:

- Dau, H.A., et al. "The UCR Time Series Classification Archive." 2019. Available at: https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data_2018/

Now, I will compile the dataset entries along with their citations. Each dataset will be documented with its name, size, length, and the citation for the UCR Time Series Classification Archive.

After completing this process, I will have a comprehensive list of datasets extracted from the paper, ready for further analysis or processing.
