To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transferring Neural Speech Waveform Synthesizers to Musical Instrument Sounds Generation" by Yi Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the research. The introduction often discusses the background and may reference datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments and Results)**, particularly **subsection 3.1 (Database and protocols)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention the **University of Rochester Music Performance (URMP) database** and the **VCTK speech corpus**. I will extract details about these datasets, including their purpose and characteristics.

1. **University of Rochester Music Performance (URMP) database**: The authors state that this database is designed for audio-visual analysis of musical performances and provides recordings of musical instruments in separate tracks. It covers 13 instruments and includes 149 tracks with a total duration of around 4.5 hours. This dataset is crucial for their experiments on musical instrument sound generation.

2. **VCTK speech corpus**: This corpus is used for pre-training the neural waveform synthesizers. The authors mention that it consists of data from 87 speakers, totaling 17,400 speech utterances with a duration of around 21 hours. This dataset is essential for the zero-shot learning and fine-tuning scenarios discussed in the paper.

After identifying the datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **University of Rochester Music Performance (URMP) database**, the citation is:
  > Bochen Li, Xinzhao Liu, Karthik Dinesh, Zhiyao Duan, and Gaurav Sharma. "Creating a multitrack classical music performance dataset for multimodal music analysis: Challenges, insights, and applications." *IEEE Transactions on Multimedia*, vol. 21, no. 2, pp. 522â€“535, 2018.

- For the **VCTK speech corpus**, the citation is:
  > Christophe Veaux, Junichi Yamagishi, Kirsten MacDonald, et al. "CSTR VCTK corpus: English multi-speaker corpus for CSTR voice cloning toolkit." University of Edinburgh. The Centre for Speech Technology Research (CSTR), 2017.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their relevant details as presented in the research paper.
