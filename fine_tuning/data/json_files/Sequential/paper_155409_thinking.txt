To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parameter-Efficient Tuning by Manipulating Hidden States of Pretrained Language Models For Classification Tasks" by Haoran Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not specify datasets. The introduction discusses various tuning methods but does not list datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using several datasets for different tasks. Specifically, they list:

1. **IMDB**: Used for sentiment classification, with 45,000 training samples and 5,000 test samples.
2. **SST (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)**: Also for sentiment classification, with 67,350 training samples and 873 test samples.
3. **MRPC (Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus)**: Used for paraphrase detection, with 3,068 training samples and 1,721 test samples.
4. **QQP (Quora Question Pairs)**: Another dataset for paraphrase detection, with 363,868 training samples and 40,432 test samples.
5. **QNLI (Question Natural Language Inference)**: Used for natural language inference, with 105,000 training samples and 5,000 test samples.
6. **RTE (Recognizing Textual Entailment)**: Another natural language inference dataset, with 2,490 training samples and 277 test samples.
7. **SciTaiL (Science Tail)**: A dataset for natural language inference, with 23,596 training samples and 2,126 test samples.
8. **CB (CommitmentBank)**: Used for natural language inference, with 250 training samples and 56 test samples.
9. **BOOLQ (Boolean Questions)**: Another natural language inference dataset, with 94,276 training samples and 3,270 test samples.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
