To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Introducing the Hidden Neural Markov Chain Framework" by Elie Azeraf et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three reference datasets for sequence labeling tasks:

1. **Universal Dependencies English (UD En)**: This dataset is used for Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagging.
2. **CoNLL 2000**: This dataset is utilized for the Chunking task.
3. **CoNLL 2003**: This dataset is employed for Named Entity Recognition (NER).

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will look for are:

- For **Universal Dependencies English (UD En)**, the citation is:
  > Joakim Nivre, Marie-Catherine De Marneffe, Filip Ginter, Yoav Goldberg, Jan Hajic, Christopher D Manning, Ryan McDonald, Slav Petrov, Sampo Pyysalo, Natalia Silveira, et al. *Universal dependencies v1: A multilingual treebank collection*. In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’16), pages 1659–1666, 2016.

- For **CoNLL 2000**, the citation is:
  > Erik F. Tjong Kim Sang and Sabine Buchholz. *Introduction to the CoNLL-2000 shared task chunking*. In Fourth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning and the Second Learning Language in Logic Workshop, 2000.

- For **CoNLL 2003**, the citation is:
  > Erik F. Tjong Kim Sang and Fien De Meulder. *Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 shared task: Language-independent named entity recognition*. In Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Natural Language Learning at HLT-NAACL 2003, pages 142–147, 2003.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
