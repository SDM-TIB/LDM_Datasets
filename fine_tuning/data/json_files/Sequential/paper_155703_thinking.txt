To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tone prediction and orthographic conversion for Basaa" by Ilya Nikitin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of pre-trained Basaa missionary and official orthography corpora, which suggests that there are datasets involved. I will look for specific names and descriptions of these datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of different orthographies used by missionaries and the need for a unified dataset for training their model. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets here.

Next, I will focus on the **data section**. The authors state that their dataset includes a training set of 10,000 phrases, a validation set of 1,000 phrases, and a test set of 1,000 phrases. This indicates that they have created a custom dataset for their experiments, but they do not provide a specific name for it.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any external datasets are cited that might have been used in their work. However, the references primarily discuss methodologies and related works rather than specific datasets.

Since the authors do not provide a formal citation for their custom dataset, I will note that it is an in-house dataset created for the purpose of their study. I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

1. **Basaa Orthography Dataset**: This dataset consists of a training set of 10,000 phrases, a validation set of 1,000 phrases, and a test set of 1,000 phrases specifically designed for tone prediction and orthographic conversion tasks in the Basaa language.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the details of the dataset and any relevant citations from the references section that may support the methodology or context of the dataset.

After gathering all necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
