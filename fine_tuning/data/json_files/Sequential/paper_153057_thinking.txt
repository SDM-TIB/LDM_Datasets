To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Kernel-based Subsequence Search for User Identification from Walking Activity" by Candelieri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract states that the proposed approach has been validated on a benchmark dataset related to user identification from walking activity. This indicates that a specific dataset is being used, but I need to find its name and details.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the authors mention the dataset again, specifically naming it as the "User Identification From Walking Activity" dataset. This confirms that this is the dataset of interest.

In the **experimental setting** section (section 4), the authors provide more details about the dataset. They mention that it consists of accelerometer data collected from 22 participants walking along a predefined path, with specific information about the data structure (e.g., time-step, x, y, z acceleration). This section also includes a link to the dataset, which is hosted on the UCI Repository.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors cite the dataset as follows:

- For the "User Identification From Walking Activity" dataset, the citation is:
  > Casale, P., Pujol, O., & Radeva, P. (2012). Personalization and user verification in wearable systems using biometric walking patterns. *Personal and Ubiquitous Computing*, 16(5), 563-580.

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **User Identification From Walking Activity Dataset**: This dataset contains accelerometer data from 22 participants, recorded while walking along a predefined path. Each participant's data is stored in a separate file, with each row containing time-step, x acceleration, y acceleration, and z acceleration.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all necessary details are captured accurately and comprehensively.
