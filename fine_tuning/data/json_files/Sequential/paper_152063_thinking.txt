To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatiotemporal Modeling for Crowd Counting in Videos" by Feng Xiong, Xingjian Shi, and Dit-Yan Yeung, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments using four publicly available datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list the four datasets:

1. **UCF CC 50 dataset**: This dataset is noted for its challenging nature, containing 50 images of varying resolutions and high crowd density. The authors reference the original work by Idrees et al. (2013) for this dataset.

2. **UCSD dataset**: This dataset consists of a 2,000-frame video of pedestrians on a walkway, and the authors cite the original work by Chan et al. (2008) for this dataset.

3. **Mall dataset**: Provided by Chen et al. (2012), this dataset includes 2,000 annotated frames of pedestrians in a shopping mall environment.

4. **WorldExpo dataset**: Introduced by Zhang et al. (2016), this dataset contains 1,132 annotated video sequences from the 2010 Shanghai World Expo.

I will then verify the citations for these datasets in the **References section** of the paper to ensure I have the correct full citations:

- For the **UCF CC 50 dataset**:
  > Idrees, H., Saleemi, I., Seibert, C., & Shah, M. (2013). Multi-source multi-scale counting in extremely dense crowd images. In CVPR (pp. 2547–2554).

- For the **UCSD dataset**:
  > Chan, A. B., Liang, Z.-S. J., & Vasconcelos, N. (2008). Privacy preserving crowd monitoring: Counting people without people models or tracking. In CVPR (pp. 1–7).

- For the **Mall dataset**:
  > Chen, K., Loy, C. C., Gong, S., & Xiang, T. (2012). Feature mining for localized crowd counting. In BMVC (p. 3).

- For the **WorldExpo dataset**:
  > Zhang, C., Li, H., Wang, X., & Yang, X. (2016). Cross-scene crowd counting via deep convolutional neural networks. In CVPR (pp. 833–841).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant details for each dataset used in the research.
