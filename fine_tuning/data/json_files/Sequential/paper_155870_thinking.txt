To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning Approach for Interruption Attacks Detection in LEO Satellite Networks" by Nacereddine Sitouah et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created their own communication datasets using satellite traffic generated from simulation platforms, which suggests that there are specific datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe the construction of their datasets. In this section, they mention two datasets:

1. **SATCOM.LEO.NDBPO.#1**: This dataset is generated by extracting useful instances from the log file and enriching them with information from the vector file. The authors describe the process of data extraction and the features included in this dataset.

2. **SATCOM.LEO.NDBPO.#2**: This dataset is created using the PcapRecorder module of Omnet++ to record communication traffic. The authors detail how they capture and process the traffic to generate this dataset.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for any relevant citations related to these datasets. However, since these datasets are generated by the authors themselves, they may not have external citations. Instead, I will note that the datasets can be found at the provided GitHub link.

The full citations for the datasets will be as follows:

- For **SATCOM.LEO.NDBPO.#1**, the citation is:
  > Sitouah, N., Merazka, F., & Hedjazi, A. (2023). *Deep Learning Approach for Interruption Attacks Detection in LEO Satellite Networks*. [Dataset available at GitHub](https://github.com/NacereddineSitouah/InterruptionLEOSATmaster).

- For **SATCOM.LEO.NDBPO.#2**, the citation is:
  > Sitouah, N., Merazka, F., & Hedjazi, A. (2023). *Deep Learning Approach for Interruption Attacks Detection in LEO Satellite Networks*. [Dataset available at GitHub](https://github.com/NacereddineSitouah/InterruptionLEOSATmaster).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the necessary details and citations for each dataset in the final output.
