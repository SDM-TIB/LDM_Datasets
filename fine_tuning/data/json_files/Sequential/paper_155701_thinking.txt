To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Why Self-Attention is Natural for Sequence-to-Sequence Problems? A Perspective from Symmetries" by Chao Ma and Lexing Ying, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and relevant sections** of the paper to identify any references to datasets. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I will pay particular attention to sections that typically discuss datasets, such as the **background, experiments, or results sections**.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets. If the authors refer to specific datasets used in their experiments or analyses, I will note their names and any relevant details provided about them, such as the number of samples, types of data, or specific characteristics.

In this paper, I will specifically check for sections that might detail experiments or methodologies, as these often include dataset descriptions. If the authors mention using datasets for training or evaluation, I will extract those names.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

If the paper does not provide full citations directly, I will look for the original papers or sources where the datasets were introduced or described. This may involve searching for the dataset names in academic databases or repositories.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation in the appropriate format.

Finally, I will ensure that the extracted information is clear and organized, ready for any further processing or presentation.
