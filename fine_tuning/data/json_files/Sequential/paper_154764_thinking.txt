To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RAW-C: Relatedness of Ambiguous Words—in Context" by Sean Trott and Benjamin Bergen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of RAW-C, a dataset of graded human relatedness judgments for ambiguous words in context. This indicates that the dataset is central to the paper's contributions.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **related work** section (Section 2). Here, the authors discuss several existing datasets that relate to their work, including:

1. **Stanford Contextual Word Similarity (SCWS)**: This dataset contains similarity judgments for English word pairs in context.
   - Citation: Huang, E. H., Socher, R., Manning, C. D., & Ng, A. Y. (2012). Improving word representations via global context and multiple word prototypes. In Proceedings of the 50th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 873–882.

2. **Word in Context (WiC)**: This dataset includes sentence pairs with an overlapping English word, labeled according to whether the word corresponds to the same or different senses.
   - Citation: Pilehvar, M. T., & Camacho-Collados, J. (2018). WiC: the word-in-context dataset for evaluating context-sensitive meaning representations. arXiv preprint arXiv:1808.09121.

3. **CoSimLex**: This dataset contains graded similarity judgments for word pairs across multiple languages.
   - Citation: Armendariz, C. S., Purver, M., Pollak, S., Ljubešić, N., Ulčar, M., Vulić, I., & Pilehvar, M. T. (2020). SemEval-2020 Task 3: Graded word similarity in context. In Proceedings of the Fourteenth Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, pages 36–49.

4. **Haber and Poesio (2020)**: This dataset contains graded similarity judgments for polysemous words in distinct sentential contexts.
   - Citation: Haber, J., & Poesio, M. (2020a). Assessing polyseme sense similarity through co-predication acceptability and contextualised embedding distance. In Proceedings of the Ninth Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics, pages 114–124.

After identifying these datasets, I will then focus on the **RAW-C dataset** itself, which is the primary dataset introduced in this paper. The authors describe the dataset construction process in Section 3, detailing how they created sentence pairs for 112 ambiguous words, with a total of 672 sentence pairs.

The citation for the RAW-C dataset is not explicitly provided in the references, but I can create a citation based on the authors and title:
- Citation: Trott, S., & Bergen, B. (2023). RAW-C: Relatedness of Ambiguous Words—in Context. University of California, San Diego. [Dataset available at GitHub: https://github.com/seantrott/raw-c]

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
