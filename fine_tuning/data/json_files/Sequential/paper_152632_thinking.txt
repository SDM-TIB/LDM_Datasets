To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WaveGlow: A Flow-Based Generative Network for Speech Synthesis" by Ryan Prenger et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, but it does reference a PyTorch implementation that produces audio samples, which suggests that datasets may be discussed later.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3), as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors state that they trained their model on the **LJ Speech Dataset**. This dataset is described as consisting of 13,100 short audio clips of a single speaker reading passages from 7 non-fiction books, totaling approximately 24 hours of speech data.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the LJ Speech Dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- **LJ Speech Dataset**: 
  > Keith Ito et al., “The LJ speech dataset,” 2017.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **LJ Speech Dataset**: This dataset is used for training the WaveGlow model and consists of 13,100 audio clips recorded from a single speaker.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset details along with their full citations, which is crucial for proper attribution in research.
