To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parallel WaveGAN: A Fast Waveform Generation Model Based on Generative Adversarial Networks with Multi-Resolution Spectrogram" by Ryuichi Yamamoto et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Database)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention using a phonetically and prosaically balanced speech corpus recorded by a female professional Japanese speaker. They provide details about the number of utterances, duration, and sampling rate, which indicates that this is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

The details provided are:
- **Dataset Name**: Phonetically and Prosaically Balanced Speech Corpus
- **Description**: The dataset consists of 11,449 utterances (23.09 hours) recorded by a female professional Japanese speaker, sampled at 24 kHz, with 16-bit quantization. It includes training, validation, and evaluation splits.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for this dataset. However, it appears that the dataset is not attributed to a specific published source in the references. This is common for proprietary datasets or those created specifically for the study.

Since the dataset does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is an internal dataset used by the authors for their experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and any relevant details, while also noting the lack of a formal citation.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read through the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section to find detailed descriptions of datasets used.
3. Note the absence of formal citations for the dataset.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry based on the information gathered.
