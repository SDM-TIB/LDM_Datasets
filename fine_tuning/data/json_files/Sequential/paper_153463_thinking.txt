To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long-Span Language Modeling for Speech Recognition" by Sarangarajan Parthasarathy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **LibriSpeech corpus**, which suggests that this is a key dataset to note.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. They mention the **LibriSpeech dataset** explicitly, describing its characteristics and how it was utilized in their research. They also discuss the creation of a new paragraph-level corpus derived from the LibriSpeech data, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

In this section, the authors explain that they started with the raw text from the same books used to create the standard LibriSpeech LM training corpus and processed it to form a new paragraph-level corpus. This new corpus is significant for their study, so I will note it as a separate dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **LibriSpeech Dataset**: The citation is:
   > V. Panayotov et al. "Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books." In: 2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP). Apr. 2015, pp. 5206â€“5210.

2. **Paragraph-Level Corpus**: Since this corpus is derived from the LibriSpeech dataset and does not have a separate citation, I will reference it as a new dataset created by the authors based on the LibriSpeech data.

After identifying and confirming the datasets, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will include both the original LibriSpeech dataset and the newly created paragraph-level corpus.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and completeness.
