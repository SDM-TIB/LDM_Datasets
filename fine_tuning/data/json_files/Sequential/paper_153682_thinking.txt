To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An enhanced Tree-LSTM architecture for sentence semantic modeling using typed dependencies" by Jeena Kleenankandy and K A Abdul Nazeer, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 5)**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **SICK (Sentence Involving Compositional Knowledge)**: This dataset consists of 9,927 sentence pairs, each annotated with a real-valued score ranging from 1 to 5, indicating their semantic similarity. The authors note that the dataset is used for semantic relatedness scoring.

2. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**: This dataset contains 11,855 sentences parsed to obtain 215,154 unique phrases, each assigned sentiment labels (positive, negative, or neutral). The authors mention that they used a subset of this dataset for sentiment classification.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **SICK dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marelli, M., Menini, S., Baroni, M., Bentivogli, L., Bernardi, R., & Zamparelli, R. (2014). A SICK cure for the evaluation of compositional distributional semantic models. In Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’14) (pp. 216–223). Reykjavik, Iceland: European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

- For the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**, the citation is:
  > Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J., Chuang, J., Manning, C. D., Ng, A., & Potts, C. (2013). Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality Over a Sentiment Treebank. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 1631–1642). Seattle, Washington, USA: Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
