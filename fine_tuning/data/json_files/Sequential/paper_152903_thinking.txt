To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Human Text Comprehension through Semi-Markov CRF-based Neural Section Title Generation" by Sebastian Gehrmann et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to data sources.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of section titles and their impact on reading comprehension. They mention the need for datasets in low-resource environments, which suggests that they may have used specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that describe the training of the models. Here, the authors mention that the **SELECTOR** is trained on the **CNN-DM corpus** and the **COMPRESSOR** is trained on the **Google sentence compression dataset**. This is crucial information as it directly identifies the datasets used in their research.

In the **experiments section**, the authors may provide additional context or details about how these datasets were utilized, but the key information about the datasets has already been identified in the methods section.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **CNN-DM corpus**, the citation is:
   > Hermann, K. M., Kocisky, T., Grefenstette, E., Espeholt, L., Kay, W., Suleyman, M., & Blunsom, P. (2015). Teaching machines to read and comprehend. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (pp. 1693-1701).

2. For the **Google sentence compression dataset**, the citation is:
   > Filippova, K., & Altun, Y. (2013). Overcoming the lack of parallel data in sentence compression. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 1481-1491).

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets:

1. **CNN-DM corpus**: A dataset used for training the SELECTOR model, consisting of news articles and their corresponding summaries.
2. **Google sentence compression dataset**: A dataset used for training the COMPRESSOR model, comprising sentence-headline pairs from news articles.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
