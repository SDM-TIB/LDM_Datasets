To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Outfit Generation and Recommendation – An Experimental Study" by Marjan Celikik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the paper evaluates various algorithms using real-world user data from one of Europe’s largest fashion stores, which indicates that datasets are involved. The introduction further emphasizes the need for personalized outfit generation and mentions the use of datasets from Zalando, which is a good lead.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention several datasets:

1. **Zalando outfit dataset (GTL and STL)**: This dataset consists of around 250,000 hand-created outfits published on Zalando, containing a total of 1 million distinct items. The outfits are composed of a single item per body part, occasionally accompanied by fashion accessories.

2. **Zalon outfit dataset**: This dataset includes approximately 380,000 recent outfits, each handcrafted for a specific customer by a professional stylist. It is based on customer questionnaire answers regarding style preferences and contains about 30,000 distinct articles.

3. **Zalando click dataset**: This dataset consists of user click actions on articles and outfits, aggregating past actions per user over a month, resulting in around 6 million valid training samples.

4. **Zalon questionnaire dataset**: This dataset contains around 250,000 questionnaires filled out by customers, providing detailed information about their style preferences, body features, and price expectations.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for any datasets that are referenced in other works. However, since the datasets are proprietary and specific to Zalando, they may not have external citations. Instead, I will note that the datasets are derived from internal sources at Zalando.

Now, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and any relevant citations:

- **Zalando outfit dataset (GTL and STL)**: 
  > This dataset consists of around 250,000 hand-created outfits published on Zalando, containing a total of 1 million distinct items.

- **Zalon outfit dataset**: 
  > A dataset of approximately 380,000 recent outfits, each handcrafted for a specific customer by a professional stylist, based on customer questionnaire answers.

- **Zalando click dataset**: 
  > This dataset consists of user click actions on articles and outfits, aggregating past actions per user over a month, resulting in around 6 million valid training samples.

- **Zalon questionnaire dataset**: 
  > Contains around 250,000 questionnaires filled out by customers, providing detailed information about their style preferences, body features, and price expectations.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its description and any relevant citations, ensuring that the details are accurate and comprehensive for future reference or analysis.
