To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convolutional LSTM Networks for Subcellular Localization of Proteins" by Søren Kaae Sønderby et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves predicting the subcellular location of proteins, which suggests that a dataset related to protein sequences is likely used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of LSTM networks for analyzing biological sequences, hinting at the need for a dataset that contains protein sequences. However, I need to find specific details about the dataset.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.4 (Subcellular Localization Data)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for training and evaluation. They state that the model was trained and evaluated on the dataset used to train the MultiLoc algorithm published by Högland et al. This section provides crucial details about the dataset:

- The dataset contains **5,959 proteins** annotated to one of **11 different subcellular locations**. 
- The authors also mention that the protein sequences were truncated to a length of 1000 for computational efficiency.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the dataset. The authors reference the original source of the dataset as Högland et al. (2006). I will check the **References section** to find the complete citation for this work:

- The citation for the dataset is:
  > Högland, Annette, Dönnes, Pierre, Blum, Torsten, Adolph, Hans-Werner, and Kohlbacher, Oliver. *MultiLoc: prediction of protein subcellular localization using N-terminal targeting sequences, sequence motifs and amino acid composition*. Bioinformatics, 22(10):1158–65, May 2006. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btl002.

With this information, I have successfully identified the dataset used in the study and its citation. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation in the required format for further processing.
