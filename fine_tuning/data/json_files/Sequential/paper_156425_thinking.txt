To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Anonymous Jamming Detection in 5G with Bayesian Network Model Based Inference Analysis" by Ying Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the development of a jamming detection model based on signal parameters collected from a 5G testbed, which suggests that there may be datasets related to jamming detection and signal analysis.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and system description sections** to identify any specific datasets used for training or evaluation. I will look for mentions of data collection methods, types of data, and any specific datasets referenced.

In the **performance evaluation section**, the authors describe the performance of various machine learning models based on data collected from the 5G testbed. They mention that the jamming waveforms were generated in MATLAB and that statistical data was collected for model training and evaluation. However, I need to find explicit names of datasets or references to existing datasets.

I will also check the **tables and figures** for any additional information about datasets. For instance, Table I describes jamming waveforms, but it does not specify a dataset name. I will need to determine if this data is part of a larger dataset or if it is a custom dataset created for this study.

After gathering information from these sections, I will consult the **References section** to find citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to extract the full citation for each.

If no specific datasets are named, I will note that the authors created a custom dataset based on their 5G testbed setup, which includes various jamming signals and statistical data. In this case, I will describe the dataset in detail, including the types of data collected and the context of its use.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes a clear description and the full citation for any referenced datasets. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, ready for further processing or review.
