To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bipartite Flat-Graph Network for Nested Named Entity Recognition" by Ying Luo and Hai Zhao, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on "three standard nested NER datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention three datasets: **ACE2005**, **GENIA**, and **KBP2017**. I will note down the details provided about each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide statistics for each dataset, which helps confirm their relevance and usage in the study. They also mention the preprocessing steps taken for each dataset, which is important for understanding how the datasets were utilized.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **ACE2005 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Christopher Walker, Stephanie Strassel, Julie Medero, and Kazuaki Maeda. *ACE 2005 Multilingual Training Corpus*. Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia, 2006.

2. **GENIA Dataset**: The citation is:
   > J-D Kim, Tomoko Ohta, Yuka Tateisi, and Junichi Tsujii. *GENIA Corpus: A Semantically Annotated Corpus for Bio-text Mining*. Bioinformatics, 2003.

3. **KBP2017 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Heng Ji, Xiaoman Pan, Boliang Zhang, Joel Nothman, James Mayfield, Paul McNamee, and Cash Costello. *Overview of TAC-KBP2017 13 Languages Entity Discovery and Linking*. Theory and Applications of Categories, 2017.

After collecting the necessary information and citations, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further studies in the field.
