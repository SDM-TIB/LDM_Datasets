To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An LSTM Feature Imitation Network for Hand Movement Recognition from sEMG Signals" by Chuheng Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilized the **NinaPro dataset**, specifically Exercise B of the DB2 database, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Data and Methods)**, where the authors describe their data acquisition process. They explicitly mention using the **NinaPro DB2 dataset** for their experiments, detailing that it includes sEMG data collected from 40 subjects performing 17 hand movements. This section provides critical information about the dataset's structure and the experimental setup.

In the **data acquisition subsection**, the authors provide specifics about the dataset, including the number of subjects, the movements performed, and the data collection methodology. This confirms that the **NinaPro DB2 dataset** is indeed the primary dataset used in their study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the NinaPro dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For **NinaPro DB2 dataset**:
  > M. Atzori, A. Gijsberts, C. Castellini, B. Caputo, A.-G. M. Hager, S. Elsig, G. Giatsidis, F. Bassetto, and H. Müller. *Electromyography data for non-invasive naturally-controlled robotic hand prostheses*. Scientific Data, vol. 1, no. 1, pp. 1–13, 2014.

Since the paper primarily discusses the NinaPro dataset, I will ensure that this dataset is accurately represented in my final output.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that the full citation is included, and prepare it for structured output as required.
