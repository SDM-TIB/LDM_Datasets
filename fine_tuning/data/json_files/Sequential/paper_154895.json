        "dcterms:description": "The dataset used in this experiment is made of sensor measurements extracted from a steel processing conveyor belt. The prediction target is the temperature of a bridle motor, which should be forecasted 5 minutes in advance to allow the operators to take preventive actions before a possible overheat. The rest of the data consist of properties of the steel strip (i.e. width, thickness and yield), the speed of the line, the tension applied by the bridles, the current temperature measurements of the motor, among others. The sensors are sampled every 10 seconds, and there are in total about 2 million samples.",
