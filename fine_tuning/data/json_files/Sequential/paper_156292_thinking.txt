To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Memory-augmented conformer for improved end-to-end long-form ASR" by Carlos Carvalho and Alberto Abad, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions that experimental results were obtained using the **Librispeech train-clean-100 and train-960 sets**, which indicates that these are the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Data and Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they specifically mention:

1. **Librispeech train-clean-100**: This dataset contains 28,539 utterances and 585 speakers.
2. **Librispeech train-960**: This dataset includes 281,241 utterances and 5,466 speakers.
3. **Librispeech dev clean and dev other**: These are used for validation, with 5,567 utterances and 188 speakers.
4. **Librispeech test clean and test other**: These are the test sets with 2,620 and 2,939 utterances, respectively.

The authors also describe subsets created from the test sets for long and very long utterances, but the primary datasets for training and evaluation are the Librispeech datasets.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the Librispeech datasets. The relevant citation for the Librispeech corpus is:

- For **Librispeech**:
  > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *Librispeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206â€“5210, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
