To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Structural Model for Analyzing Correlated Multivariate Time Series" by Changwei Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, results, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, and I will look for specific references to datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of forecasting multivariate time series and mention that they will compare their model with several state-of-the-art methods using various datasets. This indicates that datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, where the authors describe their experiments. They mention using two real-world datasets: 

1. **Amazon AWS daily billing data** for different services (S3, EC2, RDS) from early 2018.
2. **Closing prices for stocks** of Verizon and T-Mobile from 2013 to 2017.

I will also check the **experimental setup** section for more details about these datasets, such as their characteristics and how they were used in the experiments. The authors specify that the AWS billing data has weekly seasonality and that the stock prices have yearly seasonality.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since these datasets are not original datasets created by the authors but rather publicly available datasets, I will provide citations for the original sources of these datasets:

- For the **Amazon AWS billing data**, there may not be a formal citation since it is proprietary data from Amazon. However, I can note that it is publicly accessible through AWS services.
  
- For the **Verizon and T-Mobile stock prices**, I will cite the original stock market data sources, which are typically available through financial data providers or stock exchanges. A common citation format for stock data might be:
  > Yahoo Finance. *Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) Stock Price, News, Quote & History*. Retrieved from https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VZ/
  
  > Yahoo Finance. *T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS) Stock Price, News, Quote & History*. Retrieved from https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TMUS/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
