To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search for Retinal Vessel Segmentation" by Zhun Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to their method achieving top performance on three datasets: **DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE_DB1**. This indicates that these datasets are significant for their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Material)**, specifically **subsection 4.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **DRIVE**: Contains 40 images with a resolution of 565 × 584, and it uses an official train-test split.
2. **STARE**: Contains 20 images with a resolution of 700 × 605, and it employs a leave-one-out split for training and testing.
3. **CHASE_DB1**: Contains 28 images with a resolution of 999 × 960, and the first 20 images are used for training while the last 8 are for testing.

The authors also note that the datasets contain manual annotations from two experts, but they only use the annotations from the first expert as the ground truth.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **DRIVE**, the citation is:
  > Staal, Joes, et al. "Ridge-based vessel segmentation in color images of the retina." *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging* 23.4 (2004): 501-509.

- For **STARE**, the citation is:
  > Fraz, Muhammad Moazam, et al. "An ensemble classification-based approach applied to retinal blood vessel segmentation." *IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering* 59.9 (2012): 2538-2548.

- For **CHASE_DB1**, the citation is:
  > Orlando, José Ignacio, Elena Prokofyeva, and Matthew B. Blaschko. "A discriminatively trained fully connected conditional random field model for blood vessel segmentation in fundus images." *IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering* 64.1 (2016): 16-27.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
