To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gate Recurrent Unit Network based on Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion for State-of-Health Estimation" by Ziyue Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted using datasets from the Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE) and NASA Ames Prognostics Center of Excellence, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In section III (Experiments), they state that three datasets are selected for evaluation: two from CALCE and one from NASA. They provide specific names for the datasets, which are crucial for my extraction.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **CS Dataset**: This dataset includes eight batteries (CS2_35, CS2_36, CS2_37, CS2_38) from the CALCE, which have the same polar materials and charging/discharging processes but different capacity ratings.

2. **CX2 Dataset**: This dataset also includes batteries (CX2_34, CX2_36, CX2_37, CX2_38) from CALCE, similar in structure to the CS dataset.

3. **NASA RW Dataset**: This dataset includes four random walk discharging batteries (RW13, RW14, RW15, RW16) from the NASA Ames Prognostics Center of Excellence.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following references for the datasets:

- For the **CALCE datasets**, the citation is:
  > B. Bole, C. Kulkarni, and M. Daigle. "Randomized battery usage data set, NASA Ames Prognostics Data Repository. NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA," 2014.

- For the **NASA RW dataset**, the citation is:
  > W. He, N. Williard, M. Osterman, and M. Pecht. "Prognostics of lithium-ion batteries based on Dempster–Shafer theory and the Bayesian Monte Carlo method," Journal of Power Sources, vol. 196, no. 23, pp. 10 314–10 321, 2011.

- Additionally, the authors reference another paper for the NASA dataset:
  > Y. Xing, E. W. Ma, K.-L. Tsui, and M. Pecht. "An ensemble model for predicting the remaining useful performance of lithium-ion batteries," Microelectronics Reliability, vol. 53, no. 6, pp. 811–820, 2013.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach allows me to accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
