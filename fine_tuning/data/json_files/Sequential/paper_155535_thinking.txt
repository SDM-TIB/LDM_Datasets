To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Intensity and Phase Stacked Analysis of Phase-OTDR System Using Deep Transfer Learning and Recurrent Neural Networks" by Ceyhun Efe Kayan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Methods)**, particularly the subsection **2.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the experimental setup and the data collection process. Here, they mention the use of a coherent detection-based Φ-OTDR setup and detail the parameters of the experiments, including the types of disturbances applied and the characteristics of the data collected.

In this section, the authors specify that they recorded **15 Φ-OTDR recordings** and applied various sinusoidal disturbances with different amplitudes and frequencies. They also mention that they increased the dataset size through data augmentation techniques, resulting in a total of **300 data samples**.

I will also check the **Acknowledgments** and **References sections** for any additional information regarding the datasets used or any related studies that might provide context or citations for the datasets.

Now, I will compile the relevant datasets identified in the paper:

1. **Φ-OTDR Dataset**: This dataset consists of recordings from a coherent detection-based Φ-OTDR setup, capturing various sinusoidal disturbances applied to an optical fiber. The dataset includes 15 recordings with different vibration amplitudes (1, 2, 3V) and frequencies (50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 Hz). The authors mention that they have shared this dataset to contribute to the literature.

For the full citation of the dataset, I will refer to the paper itself, as it is the primary source of the dataset information. The citation for the paper is:
> Ceyhun Efe Kayan, Kivilcim Yuksel Aldogan, Abdurrahman Gumus. *An Intensity and Phase Stacked Analysis of Phase-OTDR System Using Deep Transfer Learning and Recurrent Neural Networks*. Preprint submitted to Springer. Under review.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
