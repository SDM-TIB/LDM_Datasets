To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Short-Term Aggregated Residential Load Forecasting using BiLSTM and CNN-BiLSTM" by Bharat Bohara et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a publicly available dataset consisting of 38 homes, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically where the authors describe the dataset preparation. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of aggregated residential electrical load profiles measured in 38 single-family houses in Northern Germany. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including its temporal resolution and the time period covered (from May 2018 to December 2020).

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors refer to a dataset published by Schlemminger et al. in 2022, which is essential for proper citation.

The relevant dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **Aggregated Residential Load Dataset**: This dataset includes active and reactive power measurements from 38 single-family houses, with data recorded at various temporal resolutions ranging from 10 seconds to 60 minutes. The dataset is open-sourced and consists of multiple hierarchical data format version 5 (HDF5) files for each year.

Now, I will compile the full citation for this dataset from the references section:

- For the **Aggregated Residential Load Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Schlemminger, T. Ohrdes, E. Schneider, and M. Knoop. "Dataset on electrical single-family house and heat pump load profiles in Germany." *Scientific Data*, vol. 9, no. 1, pp. 1â€“11, Feb 2022. Available: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01156-1.

After gathering this information, I will prepare to format the dataset entry according to the required structure, ensuring that all details are accurately represented and that the citation is included for reference.
