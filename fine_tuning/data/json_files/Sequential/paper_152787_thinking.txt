To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MultiGrain: a unified image embedding for classes and instances" by Maxim Berman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In **subsection 4.1 (Experimental settings)**, the authors mention that they trained their networks on the **ImageNet-2012 training set**, which consists of 1.2 million images labeled into 1,000 object categories. This is a significant dataset for image classification tasks.

Additionally, in the same section, they refer to the **Holidays dataset**, which is used for image retrieval tasks. This dataset is noted for its application in evaluating the performance of image retrieval systems.

The authors also mention the **UKB object recognition benchmark**, which contains 2,550 instances of objects under varying viewpoints, and the **INRIA Copydays dataset**, which is used for copy detection tasks. This dataset includes a "strong" subset combined with 10,000 distractor images from the YFCC100M collection.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **ImageNet-2012**:

2. **Holidays dataset**:
   > H. Jégou, M. Douze, and C. Schmid. *Hamming embedding and weak geometric consistency for large scale image search*. In Proc. ECCV, 2008.

3. **UKB dataset**:
   > D. Nister and H. Stewenius. *Scalable recognition with a vocabulary tree*. In Proc. CVPR, 2006.

4. **INRIA Copydays dataset**:
   > M. Douze, H. Jégou, H. Sandhawalia, L. Amsaleg, and C. Schmid. *Evaluation of gist descriptors for web-scale image search*. In Proc. CIVR, 2009.

5. **YFCC100M dataset** (used for distractors):
   > B. Thomee, D. A. Shamma, G. Friedland, B. Elizalde, K. Ni, D. Poland, D. Borth, and L.-J. Li. *YFCC100M: the new data in multimedia research*. Commun. ACM, 59:64–73, 2016.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its respective citation, ready for further processing or review.
