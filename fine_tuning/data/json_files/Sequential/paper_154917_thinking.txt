To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-local Graph Convolutional Network for Joint Activity Recognition and Motion Prediction" by Dianhao Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection labeled **Datasets**. In this section, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Human 3.6M Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as containing 3.6 million recordings of 3D human poses, including skeleton data for 32 joints. This dataset is crucial for their motion prediction tasks.

2. **NTU RGB+D Dataset**: This dataset is noted for containing 56,880 RGB+D video samples, including skeleton data for 32 major body joints. It is significant for both motion prediction and activity recognition tasks.

3. **CMU Mocap Dataset**: The authors mention this dataset as being collected in a lab with 12 Vicon infrared cameras, providing skeleton data for 41 joints and covering 144 human motion categories.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Human 3.6M Dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. Ionescu, D. Papava, V. Olaru, and C. Sminchisescu. *Human3.6M: Large Scale Datasets and Predictive Methods for 3D Human Sensing in Natural Environments*. 36(7):1325â€“1339, 2014.

- For the **NTU RGB+D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Amir Shahroudy, Jun Liu, Tian-Tsong Ng, and Gang Wang. *NTU RGB+D: A Large Scale Dataset for 3D Human Activity Analysis*. 2016.

- For the **CMU Mocap Dataset**, the citation is:
  > The CMU Motion Capture Database. *CMU Graphics Lab Motion Capture Database*. [Online]. Available: http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
