To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Coverage Guided Testing for Recurrent Neural Networks" by Wei Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced or described. The abstract mentions that the proposed tool TESTRNN is evaluated on a set of LSTM benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention several benchmarks in the experimental setup, specifically:

1. **MNIST Handwritten Digits Dataset**: This dataset consists of 60,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits, commonly used for training various image processing systems.

2. **IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis and contains a collection of movie reviews, typically labeled as positive or negative.

3. **Lipophilicity Dataset**: This dataset is derived from MoleculeNet and is used for predicting the lipophilicity of molecular structures represented as SMILES strings.

4. **UCF101 Dataset**: A large-scale dataset for human action recognition in videos, containing 101 action categories.

Now, I will look into the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- For the **IMDB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 142–150, 2011.

- For the **Lipophilicity Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Zhenqin, et al. *MoleculeNet: A Benchmark for Molecular Machine Learning*. Chem. Sci., 9:513–530, 2018.

- For the **UCF101 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Khurram Soomro, Amir Roshan Zamir, and Mubarak Shah. *UCF101: A Dataset of 101 Human Action Classes from Videos in the Wild*. CRCV-TR-12-01, 2012.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
