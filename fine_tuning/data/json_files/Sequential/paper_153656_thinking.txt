To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational Depth Search in ResNets" by Javier AntorÃ¡n et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The authors refer to evaluating their method on the **MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and SVHN datasets**, which indicates that these datasets are significant for their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** and **experiments sections** for further details about these datasets. In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention that they compare their method against manual search over network depths on the **MNIST**, **Fashion-MNIST**, and **SVHN** datasets. This confirms that these datasets are indeed used for evaluation.

Now, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of dataset details in the paper. The authors do not provide extensive descriptions of the datasets in the main body, but they do mention them in the context of their experiments.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of the datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and CJ Burges. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. ATT Labs [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist, 2010.

2. **Fashion-MNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. 2017.

3. **SVHN Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. 2011.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or processing.
