To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Forecasting Local Behavior of Self-organizing Many-agent System without Reconstruction" by Beomseok Kang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments. The introduction often discusses the background and may reference datasets used in prior work or the current study.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Experimental Result)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention utilizing an **agent-based forest fire model** to train and evaluate their prediction model. This section is crucial as it details the dataset's characteristics, including the types of agents involved (fire, ember, tree) and the binary states they represent.

The authors specify that the dataset consists of multiple simulations with different density parameters (76 and 72), and they provide details on how the data is structured (chunks of 60 timesteps). This information is essential for understanding the dataset's composition and its application in the experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or models referenced in the paper. The authors mention the forest fire model is inspired by the Rothermel equation, which may not be a dataset itself but is relevant for understanding the context of the experiments.

The key dataset I will extract is:

1. **Agent-based Forest Fire Model Dataset**: This dataset is generated from simulations in a NetLogo environment, focusing on the interactions between fire, ember, and tree agents. The authors mention that they generated chunk-based training and test datasets with multiple simulations, which is crucial for the dataset's description.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset:

- For the **Agent-based Forest Fire Model**, the citation is:
  > U. Wilensky, “Netlogo. Evanston, IL: Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling, Northwestern University,” 1999.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the dataset details and prepare to format them according to the specified requirements, ensuring that the full citations are included for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
