To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "CoT3DRef: Chain-of-Thoughts Data-Efficient 3D Visual Grounding" by Eslam Mohamed Bakr et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to their validation on **Nr3D, Sr3D, and ScanRefer benchmarks**, indicating that these are the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look closely at the **experiments section** where the authors discuss their methodology and results. They mention that their proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the **Nr3D, Sr3D, and ScanRefer datasets** without requiring additional manual annotations. This confirms that these datasets are central to their research.

In the **introduction**, the authors provide a brief overview of the datasets, stating that **Nr3D** contains 41.5K natural, free-form utterances, **Sr3D** consists of 83.5K synthetic utterances, and **ScanRefer** provides 51.5K utterances for 800 3D indoor scenes. This gives me a clearer understanding of the datasets' characteristics.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

1. For **Nr3D**:
   > Achlioptas, P., Abdelreheem, A., Xia, F., Elhoseiny, M., & Guibas, L. (2020). *ReferIt3D: Neural listeners for fine-grained 3D object identification in real-world scenes*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2020: 16th European Conference, Glasgow, UK, August 23–28, 2020, Proceedings, Part I 16, pp. 422–440. Springer.

2. For **Sr3D**:
   > Achlioptas, P., Abdelreheem, A., Xia, F., Elhoseiny, M., & Guibas, L. (2020). *ScanRefer: 3D object localization in RGB-D scans using natural language*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2020: 16th European Conference, Glasgow, UK, August 23–28, 2020, Proceedings, Part XX, pp. 202–221. Springer.

3. For **ScanRefer**:
   > Chen, D., Chang, A. X., & Nießner, M. (2020). *ScanRefer: 3D object localization in RGB-D scans using natural language*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2020: 16th European Conference, Glasgow, UK, August 23–28, 2020, Proceedings, Part XX, pp. 202–221. Springer.

With these citations, I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets used in the paper. I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
