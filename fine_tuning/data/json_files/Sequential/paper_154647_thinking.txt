To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MeToo Tweets Sentiment Analysis" by Rushil Thareja, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, while the introduction discusses the context and challenges of sentiment analysis in tweets related to the MeToo movement. This sets the stage for understanding the importance of the dataset.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Dataset)**, where the author describes the dataset in detail. The paper states that the dataset contains **9,973 tweets** that have been manually annotated into various sentiment categories. This section is crucial as it provides both the size of the dataset and the nature of the annotations.

The author mentions that the dataset includes labels such as **Text only informative, Image Only informative, Directed hate, Generalized hate, Sarcasm, Allegation, Justification, Refutation, Support, and Oppose**. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

Additionally, the author notes that **7172 tweets** were successfully extracted using Tweepy, which indicates that some tweets could not be retrieved due to being blocked, deleted, or banned. This detail is important for understanding the dataset's completeness and potential biases.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The author cites several works that contributed to the creation of the dataset. The relevant citations are:

1. **Chowdhury, A. G., Sawhney, R., Mathur, P., Mahata, D., & Shah, R. R. (2019)**. Speak up, fight back! detection of social media disclosures of sexual harassment.

These citations provide the necessary references for the dataset used in the study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information and citations into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their corresponding citations for future reference.
