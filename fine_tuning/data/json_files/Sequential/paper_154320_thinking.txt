To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Diacritization: Efficient Hierarchical Recurrence for Improved Arabic Diacritization" by Badr AlKhamissi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art results on the Tashkeela Arabic diacritization benchmark, suggesting that this benchmark is a dataset used in their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Approach)**, specifically **subsection 3.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset they used. Here, they describe the cleaned version of the Tashkeela corpus, which is a high-quality, publicly available dataset. They provide details about the dataset's structure, including the number of tokens in the training, development, and test sets.

The authors state that the dataset is split into:
- **Training set**: 2,449k tokens
- **Development set**: 119k tokens
- **Test set**: 125k tokens

This information confirms that the Tashkeela corpus is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Tashkeela corpus. The relevant citation is:
> Taha Zerrouki and Amar Balla. *Tashkeela: Novel corpus of Arabic vocalized texts, data for auto-diacritization systems*. Data in Brief, 11:147 â€“ 151, 2017.

Having gathered this information, I will compile the dataset details into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the Tashkeela corpus as it is crucial for proper attribution.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Tashkeela corpus, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and completeness.
