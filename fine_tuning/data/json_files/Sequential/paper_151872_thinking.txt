To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Representations for Efficient Architecture Search" by Hanxiao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. In the abstract, the authors discuss their method's performance on **CIFAR-10** and **ImageNet**, which suggests that these datasets are used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors detail their experimental setup. Here, they mention that they conducted architecture search on the **CIFAR-10 training set**, which is split into training and validation subsets. They also state that the evaluation of the learned architecture is performed on the **CIFAR-10 test set**.

In addition, the authors describe their evaluation on the **ImageNet challenge dataset** in section 4.3. This confirms that both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet are key datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset of images*. 2009. [Online]. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

2. For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael S. Bernstein, Alexander C. Berg, and Fei-Fei Li. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
