To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Saturation Line Forecasting via a Channel and Temporal Attention-based Network" by Wei Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on "five real-world datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Data Preparation)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for saturation line prediction. They mention collecting data from water level sensors over a specific time period and indicate that they have five datasets corresponding to different heights of the tailings pond. I will look for specific names or identifiers for these datasets.

In this section, the authors provide a table (Table 1) that describes the datasets, including statistical details such as mean, min, max, and percentiles. However, they do not provide explicit names for the datasets in the text. Instead, they refer to them as "NO.8," "NO.13," "NO.17," "NO.21," "NO.28," and "NO.33." I will note these identifiers as they are the only references to the datasets in the paper.

To ensure I have full citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** for any papers or sources that may have originally introduced these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for these datasets, as they appear to be derived from the authors' own data collection efforts rather than established public datasets.

Since the datasets are not publicly available or cited in the references, I will document them as follows:

1. **Dataset NO.8**: Collected from water level sensors at a specific height of the tailings pond.
2. **Dataset NO.13**: Collected from water level sensors at a different height of the tailings pond.
3. **Dataset NO.17**: Collected from water level sensors at another height of the tailings pond.
4. **Dataset NO.21**: Collected from water level sensors at yet another height of the tailings pond.
5. **Dataset NO.28**: Collected from water level sensors at a different height of the tailings pond.
6. **Dataset NO.33**: Collected from water level sensors at the final height of the tailings pond.

Since these datasets are not associated with external citations, I will note that they are part of the authors' original data collection efforts.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the identifiers and descriptions, while acknowledging the lack of formal citations for these datasets. This will provide a clear overview of the datasets used in the study, even though they are not publicly available or cited in the traditional sense.
