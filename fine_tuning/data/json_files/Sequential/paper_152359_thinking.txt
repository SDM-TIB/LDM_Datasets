To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Investigating Gated Recurrent Networks for Speech Synthesis" by Zhizheng Wu and Simon King, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus but may not mention specific datasets. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in previous studies, which could be relevant.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using a corpus from a British male speaker, divided into training, development, and testing subsets. Specifically, they state that there are 2400 training utterances, 70 development utterances, and 72 testing utterances. This indicates that the dataset is related to speech synthesis.

I will also look for any references to publicly available datasets or specific datasets used for comparison or evaluation purposes. The authors mention the use of the STRAIGHT vocoder to extract acoustic features, which suggests that they may have used a specific dataset for this purpose.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper mentions the Natural Speech Technology (NST) research data collection, which is accessible online. I will ensure to include this citation as it pertains to the dataset used in their experiments.

The relevant citations I will extract are:

1. **NST Research Data Collection**:
   > Natural Speech Technology (NST). *NST research data collection*. Available at: http://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/786.

2. **STRAIGHT vocoder** (if applicable, based on the context of the dataset):
   > Hideki Kawahara, Alain de Cheveigné. *Restructuring speech representations using a pitch-adaptive time–frequency smoothing and an instantaneous-frequency-based F0 extraction: Possible role of a repetitive structure in sounds*. Speech Communication, vol. 27, no. 3, pp. 187–207, 1999.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
