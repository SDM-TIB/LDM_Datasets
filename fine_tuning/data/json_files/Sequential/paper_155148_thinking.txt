To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analyzing Architectures for Neural Machine Translation Using Low Computational Resources" by Aditya Mandke et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, system description, and related work sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors are investigating various architectures for Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and mentions the use of a dataset, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of machine translation for low-resource languages, specifically mentioning the Indic language "Marathi." They state that they use a subset of the Samantar corpora, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (System Description)**, particularly **subsection 3.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used. They mention the **Samantar dataset**, which contains approximately 3.3 million English-Marathi parallel sentences sourced from various corpora. This section lists the specific sources contributing to the dataset, which is crucial for understanding its composition.

The authors also provide a table (Table 1) that aggregates the sizes of existing datasets used to create the Samantar dataset. This table includes datasets like JW300, cvit-pib, wikimatrix, and others, which are important to note as they contribute to the overall dataset.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations for the datasets are:

- For the **Samantar dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ramesh, G., Doddapaneni, S., Bheemaraj, A., Jobanputra, M., AK, R., Sharma, A., ... & Khapra, M. S. (2021). Samanantar: The Largest Publicly Available Parallel Corpora Collection for 11 Indic Languages. arXiv preprint arXiv:2104.05596.

- For the **JW300 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Agic, Ž., & Vulic, I. (2020). JW300: A wide-coverage parallel corpus for low-resource languages. arXiv preprint arXiv:2002.10524.

- For the **Wikimatrix dataset**, the citation is:
  > Schwenk, H., Chaudhary, V., Sun, S., Gong, H., & Guzmán, F. (2019). Wikimatrix: Mining 135m parallel sentences in 1620 language pairs from Wikipedia. arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.05791.

- For the **PMIndia dataset**, the citation is:
  > Haddow, B., & Kirefu, F. (2020). PMIndia--A Collection of Parallel Corpora of Languages of India. arXiv preprint arXiv:2001.09907.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
