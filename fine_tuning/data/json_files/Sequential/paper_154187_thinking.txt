To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Developing FB Chatbot Based on Deep Learning Using RASA Framework for University Enquiries" by Yurio Windiatmoko et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the chatbot's purpose and functionality, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **literature review and data and methods sections**. In these sections, the authors discuss various approaches and previous works related to chatbots. They mention using simulated data for training the chatbot, but I need to confirm if any specific datasets are referenced.

In the **data and methods section**, the authors describe the training process and the types of data used. They mention that the chatbot was developed using simulated data based on common dialogue interactions, but they do not provide specific dataset names or citations. This indicates that the research primarily relies on simulated data rather than publicly available datasets.

I will also check the **results and discussion section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of performance evaluation. However, the focus here is on the evaluation metrics of the chatbot's performance rather than specific datasets.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to see if any external datasets are cited. The references include various papers and resources related to deep learning and chatbot frameworks, but they do not specifically mention datasets that were used in this research.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets or their citations, I will note that the primary data used for training the chatbot is simulated data, and there are no external datasets referenced in the paper.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings:
- The research primarily uses simulated data for training the chatbot.
- No specific datasets are mentioned or cited in the paper.

This process highlights the importance of thoroughly reviewing each section of the paper to identify any datasets and their citations, even if the paper ultimately does not provide them.
