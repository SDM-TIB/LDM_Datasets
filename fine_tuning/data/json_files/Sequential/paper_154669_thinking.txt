To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Voice Conversion by Cascading Automatic Speech Recognition and Text-to-Speech Synthesis with Prosody Transfer" by Jing-Xuan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methods used, but I need to look for specific datasets in the experiments section.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors mention that they used a dataset from the **Voice Conversion Challenge 2020**. This is a significant clue, as it indicates that a specific dataset is being utilized for their experiments.

Next, I will look for details about this dataset in **subsection 4.1 (Experiment conditions)**. Here, the authors describe the dataset used for the mono-lingual task of the Voice Conversion Challenge 2020, which includes 4 source English speakers and 4 target English speakers, with specific utterance counts for training and testing. This gives me a clear understanding of the dataset's structure and purpose.

Additionally, the authors mention using the **LibriTTS corpus** for pretraining their model, which is another dataset that needs to be cited.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Voice Conversion Challenge 2020 dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but I can refer to the official website of the challenge for proper citation:
   > Voice Conversion Challenge 2020. Available at: http://www.vc-challenge.org/

2. For the **LibriTTS corpus**, the citation is:
   > Y. Wang, R. J. Skerry-Ryan, D. Stanton, Y. Wu, R. J. Weiss, N. Jaitly, Z. Yang, Y. Xiao, Z. Chen, S. Bengio et al. "LibriTTS: A corpus for text-to-speech synthesis." In Proceedings of the 2019 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 6520-6524, 2019.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Voice Conversion Challenge 2020 Dataset**: Contains recordings from 4 source and 4 target English speakers, used for evaluating voice conversion methods.
2. **LibriTTS Corpus**: A large-scale dataset for text-to-speech synthesis, used for pretraining the model.

Finally, I will compile these dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
