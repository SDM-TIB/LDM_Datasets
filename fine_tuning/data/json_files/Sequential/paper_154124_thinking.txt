To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ATM Cash demand forecasting in an Indian Bank with chaos and deep learning" by Vangala Sarveswararao and Vadlamani Ravi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves forecasting cash withdrawals using a dataset from an Indian commercial bank, which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Dataset description and evaluation metrics)**, as this section is likely to provide detailed information about the dataset used in the study. Here, the authors mention that they collected a dataset containing daily cash withdrawals from 100 ATMs over two years, specifically from November 21, 2017, to November 20, 2019. They also note that due to technical issues, data from 60 ATMs were removed, leaving data from 40 ATMs for analysis.

In this section, the authors describe the dataset's preprocessing steps, including handling missing entries and ensuring the data is stationary. This confirms the dataset's relevance and the authors' methodology for preparing it for analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is proprietary and specific to the study (from a well-known Indian commercial bank), it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note that the dataset is derived from XYZ bank, as mentioned in the paper.

Thus, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **ATM Cash Withdrawals Dataset**: This dataset contains daily cash withdrawals from 40 ATMs of a well-known Indian commercial bank (XYZ bank) over a period of two years, from November 21, 2017, to November 20, 2019. The dataset was used to model chaos and forecast cash withdrawals using various machine learning and deep learning techniques.

Since there is no formal citation for this proprietary dataset, I will note that it is specific to the study and derived from XYZ bank.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
