To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepCP: Deep Learning Driven Cascade Prediction Based Autonomous Content Placement in Closed Social Network" by Qiong Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced or described. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments using "cascade diffusion traces in WeChat Moment (WM)," indicating that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look into **Section III (Data Analysis & Framework Overview)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset used in their study. Here, they mention that the dataset contains "300 million records (35 million reshares and 265 million views) with 2250 webpages spreading in WeChat Moment (WM) in July 2016." This section provides key details about the dataset, including its size and the context in which it was collected.

In this section, the authors also clarify that the dataset is provided by FIBODATA, a company that offers services for creating and caching multimedia WM page contents. This is crucial information that I need to note down.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is provided by FIBODATA, I will look for any relevant references that might describe the dataset or its usage in more detail. However, it appears that the dataset itself does not have a formal citation like a typical academic paper, as it is a proprietary dataset from a company.

Thus, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **WeChat Moment (WM) Dataset**: This dataset consists of 300 million records, including 35 million reshares and 265 million views, with 2250 webpages spreading in WeChat Moment in July 2016. The dataset is provided by FIBODATA, which specializes in multimedia content services.

Since there are no additional datasets mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format for clarity.

In conclusion, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset details and the context in which they were used in the research, along with the relevant citation information for the dataset provider.
