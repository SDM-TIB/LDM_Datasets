To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Objective Evolutionary Design of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification" by Zhichao Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method is evaluated on benchmark image classification datasets, specifically **CIFAR, ImageNet, and human chest X-ray**. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will check the **experimental setup section** (Section IV) to find more specific information about the datasets used. Here, the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A widely used dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.

3. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with over 14 million images across 20,000 categories, commonly used for training deep learning models.

4. **ChestX-Ray14**: A dataset containing 112,120 frontal-view chest X-ray images from 30,805 patients, labeled with common thorax diseases.

After identifying these datasets, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. "Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images." Technical Report, 2009.

- For **ImageNet**:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. "ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge." International Journal of Computer Vision, 2015.

- For **ChestX-Ray14**:
  > Wang, X., Peng, Y., Lu, L., et al. "ChestX-ray8: Hospital-scale chest x-ray database and benchmarks on weakly-supervised classification and localization of common thorax diseases." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, which is crucial for proper attribution in any subsequent analysis or application.
