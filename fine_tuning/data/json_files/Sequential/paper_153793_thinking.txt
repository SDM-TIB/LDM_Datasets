To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ModuleNet: Knowledge-inherited Neural Architecture Search" by Yaran Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method shows improvements on various datasets, specifically **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100**. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section IV) to gather more details about how these datasets were utilized. In Section IV-A, the authors describe their experiments on **CIFAR100**, stating that it is a highly used dataset for image classification. They mention that the dataset has a small image size, which allows for quick training of deep models. They also provide specific configurations used during their experiments.

In Section IV-B, the authors discuss their experiments on **CIFAR10**, another well-known dataset for image classification. They detail the architecture configurations and the results obtained, confirming that this dataset was also used for their evaluations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Tech. Rep., 2009.

- For **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Tech. Rep., 2009.

Both datasets are part of the same technical report by Krizhevsky, which provides the necessary details for citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the paper.
