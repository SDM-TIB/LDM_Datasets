To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fusion of Satellite Images and Weather Data with Transformer Networks for Downy Mildew Disease Detection" by William Maillet et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of satellite imagery and weather data for crop disease detection, which suggests that datasets related to these topics are likely included.

In the **introduction**, the authors emphasize the importance of combining weather data with satellite imagery for precision agriculture. This indicates that specific datasets may be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe the data collection process. Here, they mention using **Sentinel-2 satellite images** and **weather data** collected from a local meteorological station. I need to gather details about these datasets.

1. **Sentinel-2 Satellite Images**: The authors state that they used the Sentinel-2 Level-2A product, which provides multispectral images. They mention that these images are essential for calculating vegetation indices like NDVI, NDCI, and NDMI. 

2. **Weather Data**: The paper describes the collection of weather data, which includes precipitation, temperature, humidity, and other relevant metrics. This data is crucial for the model's performance in predicting downy mildew.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For **Sentinel-2 satellite images**, the citation is:
  > European Space Agency. *Sentinel-2 User Handbook*. 2015. [Online]. Available: https://sentinel.esa.int/documents/247904/685163/Sentinel-2_User_Handbook.pdf

- For the **weather data**, since it is collected from a local meteorological station, it may not have a formal citation. However, I can note that it is sourced from the Lycée Agricole d’Amboise in the Centre Val de Loire region, France.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the datasets used in the study. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
