To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Effective Parameter Estimation Methods for an ExcitNet Model in Generative Text-to-Speech Systems" by Ohsung Kwon et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction might give insights into the datasets used, especially if the authors discuss prior work or methodologies that involve specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly sections 5.1 and 5.2, where the authors describe the databases used for training their models. In section 5.1.1, they mention using two phonetically and prosodically rich speech corpora recorded by professional Korean speakers. They provide a table (Table 1) detailing the number of utterances for both Korean male (KRM) and Korean female (KRF) speakers, which indicates the datasets used for training.

I will also check **Table 2**, which outlines the number of utterances for different emotions (neutral, happy, sad) for the Korean female speaker. This suggests that the authors utilized an expressive speech corpus, which is another dataset relevant to their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors may not provide explicit citations for the datasets in the text, but I can infer them based on the context and the references they cite.

1. For the **Korean speech corpus** used in the experiments, I will look for any references that discuss similar datasets or methodologies. If the authors refer to a specific dataset, I will note that citation.

2. For the **expressive speech corpus**, I will similarly check if there are any references that detail the dataset used for emotional speech synthesis.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset. This will involve summarizing the key details about each dataset, such as the number of utterances, the type of data (e.g., emotional, neutral), and the speakers involved.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ready for further processing or review. This systematic approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
