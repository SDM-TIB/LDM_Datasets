To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cold Fusion: Training Seq2Seq Models Together with Language Models" by Anuroop Sriram et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions the effectiveness of the Cold Fusion method on the speech recognition task, which suggests that datasets related to speech recognition might be involved.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors describe two datasets collected for their experiments:

1. **Source Dataset**: This dataset is based on search queries and contains **411,000 utterances** (approximately **650 hours of audio**). It is used as the source domain for training the models.

2. **Target Dataset**: This dataset is based on movie transcripts and contains **345,000 utterances** (approximately **676 hours of audio**). It serves as the target domain for evaluating the models.

The authors also mention that they used Amazon Mechanical Turk to collect audio recordings for both datasets, ensuring that the only difference between them is the text domain.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. However, it appears that the datasets themselves may not have formal citations like published datasets, as they were collected specifically for this research. Therefore, I will note the details as provided in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets:

- For the **Source Dataset**, I will note:
  > Source Dataset: Based on search queries, containing 411,000 utterances (650 hours of audio).

- For the **Target Dataset**, I will note:
  > Target Dataset: Based on movie transcripts, containing 345,000 utterances (676 hours of audio).

Since these datasets were created for the study and do not have formal citations, I will document them as described in the paper without additional citations.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information in a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
