To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dependency Parsing with LSTMs: An Empirical Evaluation" by Adhiguna Kuncoro et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on the **Google Web Treebank**, which indicates that this is a dataset used in their evaluation.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 3) to gather more details about the datasets used. In subsection 3.1, the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on the **Google Web Treebank**. This confirms that it is a primary dataset for their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Google Web Treebank** dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Slav Petrov and Ryan McDonald. *Overview of the 2012 shared task on parsing the web*. Notes of the First Workshop on Syntactic Analysis of Non-Canonical Language (SANCL), 2012.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the **Google Web Treebank** is the only dataset referenced in this research.

Finally, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation as required. This will allow for a clear and comprehensive representation of the dataset used in the study.
