To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-time Interface Control with Motion Gesture Recognition based on Non-contact Capacitive Sensing" by Hunmin Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets or data collection methods.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention collecting hand motion gesture data from capacitive sensors and deriving 10 gesture type datasets from three subjects. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more specific details about it.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they state that they derived a total of 1000 datasets from three subjects, which is a significant detail. However, I need to find the exact name of the dataset and any relevant information about its availability.

The authors also mention that the dataset is open-sourced and available on GitHub, which is a crucial piece of information for citation purposes. I will look for the specific GitHub link provided in the paper to ensure I can accurately cite the dataset.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference their dataset as being available on GitHub, which is noted as:
> [3] [Online], 2021, Nov. available: https://github.com/hml763/Hand-gesture-detection-system

This citation will be important for documenting the dataset properly.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: Hand Gesture Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset containing 1000 hand motion gesture samples derived from three subjects, used for gesture recognition in a non-contact capacitive sensing framework.
- **Citation**: [3] [Online], 2021, Nov. available: https://github.com/hml763/Hand-gesture-detection-system

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
