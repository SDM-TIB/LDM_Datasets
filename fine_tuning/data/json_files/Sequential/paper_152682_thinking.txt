To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Future-State Predicting LSTM for Early Surgery Type Recognition" by Siddharth Kannan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their methods on a large dataset of 425 laparoscopic videos, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention the **Laparo425 Dataset**, which consists of 425 videos belonging to 9 different classes of laparoscopic surgeries. The section provides specifics about the number of videos and the average duration for each surgery type, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Laparo425 Dataset. However, since this dataset appears to be introduced by the authors themselves, I will note that the citation for the dataset is essentially the paper itself, as it describes the dataset's creation and use.

The relevant details I will extract for the dataset are as follows:

1. **Laparo425 Dataset**: This dataset includes 425 laparoscopic videos categorized into 9 types of surgeries. The authors provide a breakdown of the number of videos and their average durations, which is essential for understanding the dataset's scope.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it appears in the paper:

- For the **Laparo425 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Siddharth Kannan, Gaurav Yengera, Didier Mutter, Jacques Marescaux, Nicolas Padoy. *Future-State Predicting LSTM for Early Surgery Type Recognition*. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 2019. DOI: 10.1109/TMI.2019.2931158.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all details are accurately represented and properly cited.
