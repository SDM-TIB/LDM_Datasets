To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BUSU-Net: An Ensemble U-Net Framework for Medical Image Segmentation" by Wei Hao Khoong, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed model in medical image segmentation, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), where the author mentions evaluating the BUSU-Net and LightBUSU-Net models on the **DRIVE dataset**. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized for the experiments.

In Section IV, the author provides details about the DRIVE dataset, stating that it consists of 40 color retina images, with 20 images used for training and 20 for testing. The original size of each image is specified as 565 × 584 pixels. This information is crucial for describing the dataset.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the DRIVE dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **DRIVE dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Staal, M. D. Abramoff, M. Niemeijer, M. A. Viergever, and B. van Ginneken. *Ridge-based vessel segmentation in color images of the retina*. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 23(4):501–509, April 2004.

Since the paper primarily discusses the DRIVE dataset, I will ensure to include this dataset's details and citation in my final output.

After gathering all necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that it includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output.
