To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequence to sequence deep learning models for solar irradiation forecasting" by Bhaskar Pratim Mukhoty et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the importance of accurate solar irradiation forecasting, which suggests that datasets related to solar irradiation and weather parameters may be involved.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Data Source and Preparation)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention that the data was sourced from the **National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)** and the **Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) India**. They specifically refer to the **National Solar Radiation Data Base (NSRDB)**, which contains solar resource maps and meteorological data across India.

In this section, the authors detail that the data was captured through weather satellites on an hourly basis from the year 2000 to 2014. They also mention that the experiments were based on data from Kharagpur, but the results are applicable to other locations as well.

Now, I will extract the relevant datasets:

1. **National Solar Radiation Data Base (NSRDB)**: This dataset includes solar irradiation data and meteorological features across a 10-kilometer grid in India, collected from 2000 to 2014.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the NSRDB dataset. The citation is as follows:

- For **National Solar Radiation Data Base (NSRDB)**, the citation is:
  > Aron Habte, Manajit Sengupta, and Anthony Lopez. *Evaluation of the national solar radiation database (nsrdb): 1998-2015*. Technical report, National Renewable Energy Lab.(NREL), Golden, CO (United States), 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will prepare the information for any further processing or review.
