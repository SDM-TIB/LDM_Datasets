To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Extended Long Short-term Memory and Dependent Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network" by Yuanhang Su and C.-C. Jay Kuo, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and testing the models. In this section, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on three problems: part of speech (POS) tagging, language modeling (LM), and dependency parsing (DP). They also specify the datasets used for these tasks.

Upon reviewing the experiments, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Penn Treebank (PTB)**: This dataset is used for the language modeling task. The authors specify that it contains 42,068 training sentences, 3,370 validation sentences, and 3,761 testing sentences, totaling 10,000 tokens.

2. **Universal Dependency 2.0 English branch (UD-English)**: This dataset is used for both the POS tagging and dependency parsing tasks. It contains 12,543 sentences and 14,985 unique tokens. The test dataset for these tasks is from the test English branch of the CoNLL 2017 shared task.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Penn Treebank (PTB)**, the citation is:
  > Marcus, M., Santorini, B., & Marcinkiewicz, M. A. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313-330.

- For the **Universal Dependency 2.0**, the citation is:
  > Nivre, J., de Marneffe, M.-C., Ginter, F., Goldberg, Y., & Mannem, P. (2016). Universal Dependencies v1: A multilingual treebank collection. *Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2016)*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper and provide proper references for each.
