To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extract, Denoise and Enforce: Evaluating and Improving Concept Preservation for Text-to-Text Generation" by Yuning Mao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions conducting experiments on "four representative text-to-text generation tasks," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.2 (Tasks and Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will find detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their names and any relevant characteristics.

The datasets mentioned in this section are:

1. **SQuAD 1.1 Dataset**: This dataset is used for the question generation task. It is repurposed from the original SQuAD dataset, which consists of questions based on a set of Wikipedia articles.

2. **Wizard of Wikipedia (WoW) Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for the knowledge-grounded dialog task. It contains dialogues grounded in specific knowledge sources, which are essential for the analysis conducted in the paper.

3. **English Gigaword Dataset**: This dataset is employed for the headline generation task. It consists of a large collection of news articles, which the authors use in a low-resource setting.

4. **CNN/Daily Mail Dataset**: This dataset is used for the abstractive summarization task. It contains news articles from CNN and the Daily Mail, which are commonly used for evaluating summarization models.

5. **XSum Dataset**: This dataset is also used for the abstractive summarization task. It is known for its extreme summarization challenges, where the goal is to generate a single-sentence summary of a news article.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
