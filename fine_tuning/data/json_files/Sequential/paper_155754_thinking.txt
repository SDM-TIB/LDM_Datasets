To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MogaNet: Multi-Order Gated Aggregation Network" by Siyuan Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that MogaNet exhibits competitive performance on various downstream vision benchmarks, which suggests that multiple datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details about their characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention several tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and human pose estimation. They specifically reference the following datasets:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset for image classification, which is commonly used in the field. The authors mention achieving top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K.

2. **COCO (Common Objects in Context)**: This dataset is used for object detection and instance segmentation tasks. The authors report performance metrics such as AP (Average Precision) for various models.

3. **ADE20K**: This dataset is utilized for semantic segmentation tasks, and the authors provide performance metrics on this dataset as well.

4. **COCO for 2D human pose estimation**: The authors mention using COCO for evaluating 2D key points estimation.

5. **FreiHAND**: This dataset is referenced for 3D human pose estimation tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:

- For **COCO**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
