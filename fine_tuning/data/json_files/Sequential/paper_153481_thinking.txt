To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Periodic Spectral Ergodicity: A Complexity Measure for Deep Neural Networks and Neural Architecture Search" by Mehmet Süzen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a complexity measure for deep neural networks and mentions testing on two sets of vision models, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors describe their testing methodology. They specifically mention using **pre-trained weights on ImageNet classification tasks** for their experiments with VGG and ResNet architectures. This indicates that the ImageNet dataset is a key dataset used in their research.

I will also check the **acknowledgements and notes section** for any additional datasets mentioned. The authors express gratitude to the PyTorch core team for bundling datasets neatly, which reinforces the use of ImageNet.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the ImageNet dataset in the **References section**. The ImageNet dataset is widely recognized, and I can provide the following citation:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211–252, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for ImageNet, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for review or further processing.
