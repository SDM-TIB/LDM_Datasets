To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Hierarchical Reinforced Sequence Operation Method for Unsupervised Text Style Transfer" by Chen Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two text style transfer datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 5)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In this section, they refer to two datasets: **Yelp** and **Amazon**. I will note the context in which these datasets are mentioned, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In **Section 5.1 (Datasets)**, the authors provide a brief description of each dataset:

1. **Yelp Dataset**: This dataset consists of business reviews with labeled sentiments ranging from 1 to 5. Reviews rated greater than 3 are considered positive, while those rated lower than 3 are negative.

2. **Amazon Dataset**: Similar to the Yelp dataset, this dataset contains product reviews with labeled sentiments. Positive and negative samples are defined in the same manner as in the Yelp dataset.

The authors also mention that they followed the split of datasets as provided by Li et al. (2018), which is crucial for proper citation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citation for the dataset splits is:

- For the **Yelp Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Li, R. Jia, H. He, and P. Liang. *Delete, retrieve, generate: A simple approach to sentiment and style transfer*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, NAACL-HLT 2018, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA, June 1-6, 2018, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 1865â€“1874.

- For the **Amazon Dataset**, the citation is the same as above since it is referenced in the same context.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both datasets as required. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly credited in any subsequent analysis or application.
