To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accelerating the Genetic Algorithm for Large-scale Traveling Salesman Problems by Cooperative Coevolutionary Pointer Network with Reinforcement Learning" by Rui Zhong et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions validating the proposed method on **10 LSTSPs**, which indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors state that they conducted experiments on **10 LSTSP instances** and refer to a table (Table I) that lists the benchmarks used. This table will likely contain the names and details of the datasets.

Upon reviewing Table I, I find the following datasets:

1. **dkg813**: This dataset consists of 813 cities and has an optimal tour length of 3199.
2. **lim963**: This dataset consists of 963 cities with an optimal tour length of 2789.
3. **pbd984**: This dataset consists of 984 cities with an optimal tour length of 2797.
4. **xit1083**: This dataset consists of 1083 cities with an optimal tour length of 3558.
5. **dka1376**: This dataset consists of 1376 cities with an optimal tour length of 4666.
6. **dca1389**: This dataset consists of 1389 cities with an optimal tour length of 5085.
7. **dja1436**: This dataset consists of 1436 cities with an optimal tour length of 5257.
8. **icw1483**: This dataset consists of 1483 cities with an optimal tour length of 4416.
9. **fra1488**: This dataset consists of 1488 cities with an optimal tour length of 4264.
10. **rbv1583**: This dataset consists of 1583 cities with an optimal tour length of 5387.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that the benchmarks are downloaded from a specific source, which is indicated as [22]. I will look up this reference to provide the full citation.

The reference [22] is:
> W. Cook, "Traveling salesman problem," http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/index.html/.

This source provides access to the datasets used in the experiments.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations. Each dataset will be described with its name, number of cities, optimal tour length, and the citation for the source from which it was obtained.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited.
