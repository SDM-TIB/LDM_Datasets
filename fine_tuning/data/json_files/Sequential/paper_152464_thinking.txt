To extract datasets from the research paper titled "News Article Teaser Tweets and How to Generate Them" by Sanjeev Kumar Karn et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the compilation of a novel dataset of teasers, which indicates that there is a dataset relevant to the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Teaser Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of how they collected and analyzed the dataset. They mention that they compiled a dataset of approximately **1.4 million data items** from Twitter, specifically indicative tweets that contain links to news articles. This section is crucial as it outlines the dataset's characteristics and the methodology used for its collection.

In this section, the authors describe the dataset as containing **news articles, ShortcutTexts (both teasers and headlines), and story-highlights**. This indicates that the dataset is multifaceted and includes various forms of short texts associated with news articles.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this paper, the authors do not provide a separate citation for the dataset they compiled, as it is based on their own collection from Twitter. Instead, they reference existing works that relate to the methodologies they employed, such as the use of Twitter data and the concept of teasers.

Since the dataset is novel and not previously published, I will document it as follows:

1. **Teaser Dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately 1.4 million indicative tweets collected from various English-language news publications on Twitter. It includes news articles, teasers, headlines, and story-highlights.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset's name, description, and the authors of the paper as the citation.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> Sanjeev Kumar Karn, Mark Buckley, Ulli Waltinger, and Hinrich Sch√ºtze. *News Article Teaser Tweets and How to Generate Them*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2023.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
