To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) vs Classical LSTM in Time Series Forecasting: A Comparative Study in Solar Power Forecasting" by Saad Zafar Khan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses real-world photovoltaic datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Methodology)**, particularly the **5.1 (Data Description)** subsection, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Real-World Solar Plant Data**: This dataset is sourced from Kaggle and consists of operational data from two photovoltaic plants in India. It includes geographical coordinates, power output variables, and weather variables.

2. **Simulated Solar Power Data**: This dataset is from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and includes high-resolution power generation data and corresponding weather conditions. It spans a full year of data and provides a granular view of power fluctuations.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Real-World Solar Plant Data**, the citation is:
  > A. Kannal. *Solar power generation data, version 1*. Kaggle Dataset, 2020. Retrieved June 20, 2023.

- For the **Simulated Solar Power Data**, the citation is:
  > National Renewable Energy Laboratory. *Solar power data for integration studies*, 2023. Accessed: 2023-08-03.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. Real-World Solar Plant Data from Kaggle.
2. Simulated Solar Power Data from NREL.

I will ensure that the full citations are included for each dataset to maintain proper attribution and facilitate further research.
