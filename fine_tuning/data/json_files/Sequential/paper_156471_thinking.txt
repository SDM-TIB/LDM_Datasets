To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enabling Smart Retrofitting and Performance Anomaly Detection for a Sensorized Vessel: A Maritime Industry Experience" by Mahshid Helali Moghadam et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and empirical evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study evaluates a performance anomaly detection system using real data from a sensorized vessel called TUCANA. This suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **empirical evaluation section** where the authors describe the data used for their experiments. They mention that the data consists of sensory data collected from various sensors on the vessel, including navigational data such as the vessel's position, direction of movement, and engine data like revolutions per minute (RPM) and battery voltage levels. This section provides a clear indication of the dataset's nature.

The authors specify that they used **two test datasets** for evaluation:
1. **Test Data 1**: This dataset contains data collected during an occurrence of a propeller failure.
2. **Test Data 2**: This dataset includes data from a number of critical maneuvering test scenarios.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. However, since the datasets are derived from the operational data of the vessel TUCANA and do not appear to be published datasets, I will note that the datasets are proprietary to the study and do not have formal citations.

To summarize, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **Test Data 1**: Data from the vessel TUCANA during a propeller failure.
2. **Test Data 2**: Data from critical maneuvering test scenarios on the vessel TUCANA.

Since these datasets are specific to the study and do not have external citations, I will note that they are part of the proprietary data collected during the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
