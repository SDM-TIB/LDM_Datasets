To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Supervised and Self-Supervised Pretraining Based COVID-19 Detection Using Acoustic Breathing/Cough/Speech Signals" by Xing-Yu Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **DiCOVA dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **results** sections, particularly focusing on the **Datasets** subsection. Here, the authors describe the **DiCOVA dataset** in detail, noting that it consists of labeled data for breathing, cough, and speech sounds, which are crucial for their COVID-19 detection model. They also mention that the dataset includes a total of 965 samples, with a breakdown of positive and negative samples.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **DiCOVA dataset**. The paper cites the dataset as follows:

- **DiCOVA dataset**: 
  > Neeraj Kumar Sharma, Srikanth Raj Chetupalli, Debarpan Bhattacharya, Debottam Dutta, Pravin Mote, and Sriram Ganapathy. *The Second DiCOVA Challenge: Dataset, task, and baseline system for COVID-19 diagnosis using acoustics*. Available at: https://dicovachallenge.github.io/docs/Second_DiCOVA2_baselineSystem_doc.pdf.

Additionally, the paper references the **Coswara dataset**, which is the source of the DiCOVA dataset. I will also extract its citation:

- **Coswara dataset**: 
  > N Sharma, P Krishnan, R Kumar, S Ramoji, SR Chetupalli, R Nirmala, P Kumar Ghosh, and Ganapathy. *Coswara - A database of breathing, cough, and voice sounds for COVID-19 diagnosis*. In Proceedings of Interspeech, 2020, pp. 4811â€“4815.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
