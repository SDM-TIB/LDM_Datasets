To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Teacher-Student Curriculum Learning" by Tambet Matiisen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed framework on two tasks: addition of decimal numbers with LSTM and navigation in Minecraft. This indicates that there may be datasets associated with these tasks.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as it typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In section 4.1, the authors describe the task of decimal number addition, referencing a previous work by Zaremba and Sutskever (2014) for the curriculum learning approach. This suggests that the dataset used for this task is related to decimal addition, but I need to confirm the exact dataset and its citation.

In section 4.2, the authors discuss the Minecraft environment, specifically mentioning the use of the Malmo platform for generating random mazes. This indicates that the dataset for the Minecraft task is not a traditional dataset but rather a dynamic environment generated during the experiments.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

1. **Decimal Number Addition Dataset**: The dataset is based on the task of adding decimal numbers, as described in the work by Zaremba and Sutskever (2014). The citation for this dataset is:
   > Wojciech Zaremba and Ilya Sutskever. *Learning to Execute*. In Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2014. Available at: http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.4615.

2. **Minecraft Environment**: The authors utilized the Malmo platform for their experiments in Minecraft. The citation for the Malmo platform is:
   > Matthew Johnson, Katja Hofmann, Tim Hutton, and David Bignell. *The Malmo Platform for Artificial Intelligence Experimentation*. In International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), 2016.

Since the Minecraft task does not rely on a static dataset but rather on a generated environment, I will note that the dataset is dynamic and based on the Malmo platform.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the full citations for both datasets clearly documented for future reference or processing. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
