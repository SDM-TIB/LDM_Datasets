To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpreting Attention Models with Human Visual Attention in Machine Reading Comprehension" by Ekta Sood et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions a novel eye-tracking dataset called **MQA-RC**, which is a strong indicator that this dataset is significant to the research. The introduction may provide additional context about the dataset and its purpose.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe the **MQA-RC dataset** in detail in section 3.2, where they explain its purpose, structure, and how it was collected. They also mention the **MovieQA dataset** in section 3.1, which is used in their experiments.

In section 3.1, the **MovieQA dataset** is described as containing plot synopses and associated questions, which is crucial for understanding the context in which the dataset is used. The authors provide specific details about the number of questions and the structure of the dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citations for both datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **MQA-RC Dataset**: The paper does not provide a separate citation for the MQA-RC dataset since it is introduced as a novel dataset in this work. However, I will note that it is available at the provided URL in the paper.

2. **MovieQA Dataset**: The citation for the MovieQA dataset is:
   > Makarand Tapaswi, Yukun Zhu, Rainer Stiefelhagen, Antonio Torralba, Raquel Urtasun, and Sanja Fidler. *MovieQA: Understanding Stories in Movies through Question-Answering*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 4631â€“4640, 2016.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **MQA-RC Dataset**: A novel eye-tracking dataset created to analyze reading behavior in machine reading comprehension tasks, consisting of gaze data from 23 participants reading 32 documents.
  
- **MovieQA Dataset**: A dataset containing plot synopses and questions designed for evaluating machine comprehension of movie narratives.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the citations are accurately represented.
