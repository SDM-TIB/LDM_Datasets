To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Light-weight CNN Model for Efficient Parkinson’s Disease Diagnostics" by Xuechao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and materials sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected hand-drawn data to distinguish Parkinson’s disease patients from healthy controls, suggesting that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Material)**, where the authors describe the dataset referred to as **DraWritePD**. This section provides detailed information about the dataset, including the number of participants, the data acquisition method, and the parameters collected during the hand-drawing tests. 

The paper states that the DraWritePD dataset was acquired from 49 participants, with specific parameters captured during the drawing tests. This section is crucial as it outlines the dataset's structure and the context in which it was collected.

I will also check the **experimental results section** to confirm that the DraWritePD dataset was used for training and testing the proposed model. The authors provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of sequence data and the distribution between healthy controls and Parkinson’s disease patients.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the DraWritePD dataset. However, since this dataset appears to be original to the authors and not previously published, I will note that the citation will refer to the paper itself.

The citation for the DraWritePD dataset will be:
> Xuechao Wang, Junqing Huang, Marianna Chatzakou, Kadri Medijainen, Pille Taba, Aaro Toomela, Sven Nomm, Michael Ruzhansky. *A Light-weight CNN Model for Efficient Parkinson’s Disease Diagnostics*. In Proceedings of the [insert conference name], [insert page numbers], [insert year].

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the name, description, and citation, ensuring that it is clear and complete for future reference or processing. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the dataset used in this research paper.
