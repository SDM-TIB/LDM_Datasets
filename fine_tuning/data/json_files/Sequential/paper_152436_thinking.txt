To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodal Sequence to Sequence Models for Sentiment Analysis" by Hai Pham et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to their experiments on the **CMU-MOSI dataset**, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (specifically section 5) where the authors provide details about the dataset used. Here, they describe the **CMU Multimodal Opinion-level Sentiment Intensity dataset (CMU-MOSI)**, which contains video, audio, and transcription data from 89 speakers across 93 videos, totaling 2199 sentiment labels ranging from -3 to 3.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **future directions** section (section 8), where the authors reference other datasets like the **Persuasion Opinion Multimodal (POM) dataset** and the **IEMOCAP dataset** as potential sources for pre-training their model.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **CMU-MOSI Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Amir Zadeh, Rowan Zellers, Eli Pincus, and Louis-Philippe Morency. *Multimodal sentiment intensity analysis in videos: Facial gestures and verbal messages*. IEEE Intelligent Systems, 31(6):82–88, 2016.

2. **Persuasion Opinion Multimodal (POM) Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Sunghyun Park, Han Suk Shim, Moitreya Chatterjee, Kenji Sagae, and Louis-Philippe Morency. *Computational analysis of persuasiveness in social multimedia: A novel dataset and multimodal prediction approach*. In Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Multimodal Interaction, pages 50–57, 2014.

3. **IEMOCAP Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Cowie, R., et al. *IEMOCAP: Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture Database*. 2008.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
