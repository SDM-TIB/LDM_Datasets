To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LSTM-based Load Forecasting Robustness Against Noise Injection Attack in Microgrid" by Amirhossein Nazeri and Pierluigi Pisu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the performance of an LSTM model under noise injection attacks, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of accurate load forecasting and mention the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and LSTMs, but again, no specific datasets are named. 

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** (specifically section II and III) where the authors describe the LSTM model's architecture and the noise injection attack. They mention that the model makes predictions based on historical load data, but they do not provide a specific dataset name.

In the **results section**, the authors present tables comparing the mean absolute error (MAE) of the LSTM model under different noise conditions. They refer to "one-year load data" but do not specify the source or name of this dataset.

Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset names or citations, I will need to look at the **references section** to see if any of the cited works include datasets that could be relevant. 

The references include:
1. Xishuang Dong et al. (2017) discusses short-term load forecasting but does not specify a dataset.
2. G. Van Houdt et al. (2020) reviews LSTM models but does not mention a dataset either.

Given that the paper does not explicitly name any datasets or provide citations for specific datasets used in their experiments, I will conclude that there are no identifiable datasets to extract from this paper.

In summary, I will document that the paper discusses load forecasting using LSTM models and noise injection attacks but does not provide specific datasets or citations for datasets used in the research. Therefore, I will not create any dataset entries as there are none to reference.
