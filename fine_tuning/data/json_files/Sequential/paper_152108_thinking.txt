To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large-Scale YouTube-8M Video Understanding with Deep Neural Networks" by Manuk Akopyan and Eshsou Khashba, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions the use of the **YouTube-8M large-scale dataset**, which indicates that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Input Data)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the YouTube-8M dataset. They mention that it contains 4716 classes and more than 8 million videos, split into training, validation, and test subsets. This section will provide essential details about the dataset's structure and characteristics.

In this section, the authors describe two types of datasets available within YouTube-8M:
1. **Frame-level features dataset**: This dataset contains preprocessed video data where each video is decoded at 1 frame per second for up to 360 seconds, and features are extracted using the Inception-v3 network.
2. **Video-level features dataset**: This dataset aggregates features from the frame-level dataset.

Since the authors specify that they will use the frame-level dataset for their models, I will focus on this dataset for extraction.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the YouTube-8M dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> Sami Abu-El-Haija, Nisarg Kothari, Joonseok Lee, Paul Natsev, George Toderici, Balakrishnan Varadarajan, Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan. *YouTube-8M: A Large-Scale Video Classification Benchmark*. arXiv:1609.08675 (2016).

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extraction:

1. **YouTube-8M Dataset**: A large-scale dataset containing over 8 million videos, categorized into 4716 classes, with frame-level and video-level features available.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the full citation, into a structured format for further use or processing.
