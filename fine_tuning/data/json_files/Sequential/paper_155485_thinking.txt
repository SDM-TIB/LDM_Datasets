To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EdiT5: Semi-Autoregressive Text Editing with T5 Warm-Start" by Jonathan Mallinson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the evaluation of EDIT5 on three NLG tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 3) closely, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention three distinct tasks: Sentence Fusion, Grammatical Error Correction (GEC), and Decontextualization. Each task likely corresponds to a specific dataset.

I will look for subsections or tables within Section 3 that provide dataset statistics. For example, the authors mention using the "balanced Wikipedia" portion of the DiscoFuse dataset for Sentence Fusion, which is a clear indication of a dataset name. 

For GEC, the authors refer to the BEA dataset, which is a standard dataset for grammatical error correction tasks. For Decontextualization, they mention using data from Choi et al. (2021), which indicates that this dataset is also relevant.

Now, I will compile the dataset names and their descriptions:

1. **DiscoFuse Dataset**: Used for the Sentence Fusion task. The authors reference the "balanced Wikipedia" portion of this dataset.
   
2. **BEA Dataset**: Used for the Grammatical Error Correction task. This dataset is commonly used in GEC research.

3. **Decontextualization Dataset**: The authors use the train, dev, and test data from Choi et al. (2021) for this task.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **DiscoFuse Dataset**, the citation is:

Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **BEA Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Decontextualization Dataset**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset names, their descriptions, and the full citations. This will allow me to create structured entries for each dataset as required.
