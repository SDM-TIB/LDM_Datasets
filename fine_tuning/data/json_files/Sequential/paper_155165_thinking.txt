To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "TYOLOV5: A Temporal YOLOV5 Detector Based on Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks for Real-Time Handgun Detection in Video" by Mario Alberto Duran-Vega et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that two publicly available datasets are proposed, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4 (Experiments and Discussion)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. In **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors provide information about two datasets:

1. **Hands Guns and Phones (HGP) Dataset**: This dataset contains 2199 images (1989 for training and 210 for testing) labeled with bounding boxes for hands, guns, and phones. The images are collected from YouTube videos and are available at a specified Google Drive link.

2. **Temporal Hands Guns and Phones (THGP) Dataset**: This dataset consists of 5960 video frames (5000 for training and 960 for testing) derived from 50 videos of various scenarios. It is also labeled with bounding boxes for hands, guns, and phones, and is available at another Google Drive link.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, since these datasets are newly proposed in this paper, they may not have separate citations in the references. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper itself.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citations for the datasets as described in the paper:

- For the **HGP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Duran-Vega, M. A., Gonzalez-Mendoza, M., Chang, L., & Suarez-Ramirez, C. D. (2021). *Hands Guns and Phones (HGP) Dataset*. Available at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/138Zp7MuchcS4He6LBFSTow5q97BwnpWv.

- For the **THGP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Duran-Vega, M. A., Gonzalez-Mendoza, M., Chang, L., & Suarez-Ramirez, C. D. (2021). *Temporal Hands Guns and Phones (THGP) Dataset*. Available at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hF7Vr6g0fG56Oy3Jdnm2t9Y3TK9W9bn4.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clearly articulated, including the dataset names, descriptions, and links, ready for further processing or review.
