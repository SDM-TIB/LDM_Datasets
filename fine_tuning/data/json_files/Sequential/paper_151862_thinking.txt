To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving OCR Accuracy on Early Printed Books using Deep Convolutional Networks" by Christoph Wick, Christian Reul, and Frank Puppe, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a combination of CNN and LSTM networks for OCR, but it does not specify datasets. The introduction mentions the need for ground truth (GT) data for training, which suggests that datasets will be discussed later.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Material and Methods)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three early printed books used for evaluation:

1. **Book from 1476**: This book is part of the Early New High German Reference Corpus and contains 2000 ground truth lines for training and 1000 for validation.
2. **Book from 1488**: This book was gathered during a case study of highly automated layout analysis, with 3178 ground truth lines for training and 1000 for validation.
3. **Book from 1505**: This book is an edition of "Ship of Fools" by Sebastian Brant, containing 2289 ground truth lines for training and 1000 for validation.

The authors provide a table summarizing the details of these books, which confirms their use as datasets for the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since these are specific books rather than formal datasets published in separate papers, I will cite them based on the information provided in the paper:

- For the **1476 book**, the citation is:
  > Early New High German Reference Corpus. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/wegera/ref/index.htm

- For the **1488 book**, the citation is:
  > Reul, C., Dittrich, M., & Gruner, M. (2017). Case study of a highly automated layout analysis and OCR of an incunabulum: 'Der heiligen leben' (1488). In Proceedings of the 2Nd Int. Conf. on Digital Access to Textual Cultural Heritage, DATeCH2017, pages 155â€“160, New York, NY, USA. ACM.

- For the **1505 book**, the citation is:
  > Brant, S. (1505). *Ship of Fools*. [Edition]. Retrieved from http://kallimachos.de/kallimachos/index.php/Narragonien

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
