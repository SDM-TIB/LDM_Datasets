To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "A Practical Chinese Dependency Parser Based on a Large-Scale Dataset" by Shuai Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions a large-scale manually labeled dataset called **Baidu Chinese Treebank (DuCTB)**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **Datasets section** (section 2) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find two datasets explicitly mentioned:

1. **Baidu Chinese Treebank (DuCTB)**: This dataset consists of about one million annotated sentences from various sources, including search logs, news articles, forum discussions, and conversation programs. It is specifically designed for dependency parsing tasks.

2. **Chinese Treebank 5 (CTB5)**: This dataset contains 18,786 sentences sourced from newswire content, which is split into training, development, and test sets.

In the **Experiments section** (section 4), the authors confirm that they conducted experiments using both the **DuCTB** and **CTB5** datasets, which reinforces their significance in the study.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Baidu Chinese Treebank (DuCTB)**, since it is a dataset created by the authors, I will cite it as follows:
  > Shuai Zhang, Lijie Wang, Ke Sun, and Xinyan Xiao. *Baidu Chinese Treebank (DuCTB)*. Baidu, 2020. [Available at: https://github.com/baidu/DDParser]

- For **Chinese Treebank 5 (CTB5)**, the citation is:
  > Naiwen Xue, Fei Xia, Fu-Dong Chiou, and Marta Palmer. *The Penn Chinese Treebank: Phrase Structure Annotation of a Large Corpus*. Natural Language Engineering, 11(2):207, 2005. [Available at: https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2005T01]

With this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have captured all necessary details for future reference or processing.
