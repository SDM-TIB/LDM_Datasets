To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Speaking Style Adaptation in Text-to-Speech Synthesis Using Sequence-to-Sequence Models with Attention" by Bajibabu Bollepalli et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves adapting a TTS system to Lombard style, which suggests that specific datasets may be used for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the speech material used for their experiments. Here, they mention two key datasets:

1. **Blizzard Challenge 2011 Speech Corpus**: This dataset contains around 12,000 utterances (approximately 16 hours) read by a professional female voice talent named Nancy. This dataset is crucial for training the initial Seq2Seq-TTS model.

2. **Hurricane Challenge Data**: This dataset consists of both normal and Lombard speech data spoken by a British male voice professional named Nick. The normal speech data includes 2,592 utterances (around 2 hours), while the Lombard speech data consists of 720 utterances (approximately 30 minutes). This dataset is used for adapting the TTS system to Lombard style.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Blizzard Challenge 2011 Speech Corpus**, the citation is:
  > King, S., & Karaiskos, V. (2011). *The Blizzard Challenge 2011*.

- For the **Hurricane Challenge Data**, the citation is:
  > Cooke, M., Mayo, C., & Valentini-Botinhao, C. (2013). *Hurricane natural speech corpus* [sound].

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited in any subsequent analysis or application.
