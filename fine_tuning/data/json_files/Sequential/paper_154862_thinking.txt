To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Development of a Conversation State Prediction System" by Sujay Uday Rittikar, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study is based on audio samples from natural conversations, which suggests that datasets are involved, but it does not specify their names.

Next, I will examine the **Data Collection** section (2.1) in detail. Here, the author mentions that the audio samples are collected from live videos and that there are two datasets representing different conversations. However, the specific names of these datasets are not provided in this section.

I will then look for any references to the datasets in the **Experiments and Evaluation** section (4.1) or any other relevant sections. The paper discusses the use of audio samples but does not explicitly name the datasets used for the experiments.

Since the paper mentions that the audio samples are based on "standard public datasets," I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited there. I will look for any references that might correspond to the datasets used in the study.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that there are no specific datasets named in the citations. However, I will note any relevant papers that might describe datasets used in similar contexts, such as those related to speaker diarization or conversational AI.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets:

1. **Dataset 1**: The first dataset is described as containing audio samples from natural conversations, but it lacks a specific name or citation.
2. **Dataset 2**: The second dataset is also mentioned as containing audio samples from conversations, but again, no specific name or citation is provided.

Since the paper does not provide full citations for these datasets, I will note that the datasets are based on standard public datasets related to speaker diarization and conversational AI, but I cannot provide specific citations.

In conclusion, while I have identified that there are two datasets used in the study, the lack of specific names and citations in the paper limits my ability to provide full citations for them. I will document this finding clearly, indicating the need for further investigation or clarification from the authors regarding the datasets used.
