To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Robust Numerical Question Answering: Diagnosing Numerical Capabilities of NLP Systems" by Jialiang Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on various Numerical Question Answering systems and datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors specifically mention three datasets used for their experiments: **ASDiv-a**, **DROP**, and **TATQA**. I will note down these names and look for their descriptions.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a brief overview of the datasets:
1. **ASDiv-a**: This dataset is mentioned as a benchmark for evaluating numerical capabilities in question answering.
2. **DROP**: This dataset is noted for requiring discrete reasoning over paragraphs.
3. **TATQA**: This dataset is highlighted for its hybrid nature of tabular and textual content.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

- For **ASDiv-a**, the citation is:
  > Shen, Y., Miao, S., & Su, K. (2020). A diverse corpus for evaluating and developing English math word problem solvers. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 975–984.

- For **DROP**, the citation is:
  > Dua, D., Wang, Y., Dasigi, P., Stanovsky, G., Singh, S., & Gardner, M. (2019). DROP: A reading comprehension benchmark requiring discrete reasoning over paragraphs. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 2368–2378.

- For **TATQA**, the citation is:
  > Zhu, F., Lei, W., Huang, Y., Wang, C., Zhang, S., Lv, J., & Chua, T. (2021). TAT-QA: A question answering benchmark on a hybrid of tabular and textual content in finance. In Proceedings of the 59th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 3277–3287.

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the details of each dataset, including their purpose and any relevant statistics mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ready for further analysis or integration into a larger dataset repository.
