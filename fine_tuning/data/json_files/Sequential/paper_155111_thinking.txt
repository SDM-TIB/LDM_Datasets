To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Text-Image Joint Embedding for Efficient Cross-Modal Retrieval with Deep Feature Engineering" by Zhongwei Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the authors use the **Recipe1M dataset** for technical description and empirical validation, which indicates that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they evaluate their method on the **Recipe1M dataset**, which consists of over 800K recipes and 1 million associated food images. This section provides a clear indication that Recipe1M is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

I will also check the **related work** and **methodology sections** to see if there are any references to other datasets that might have been used for comparison or as part of their methodology. However, the focus remains on the Recipe1M dataset throughout the paper.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the **Recipe1M dataset** from the references section. The citation is as follows:
> Javier Marin, Aritro Biswas, Ferda Ofli, Nicholas Hynes, Amaia Salvador, Yusuf Aytar, Ingmar Weber, and Antonio Torralba. *Recipe1m+: A dataset for learning cross-modal embeddings for cooking recipes and food images*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2019.

Since Recipe1M is the only dataset explicitly mentioned and used in the experiments, I will create a structured entry for it.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that captures the essential details, including the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that the citation is complete and accurate for future reference.
