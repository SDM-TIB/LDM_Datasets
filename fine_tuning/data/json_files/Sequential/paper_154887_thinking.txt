To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Short-term Hourly Streamï¬‚ow Prediction with Graph Convolutional GRU Networks" by Muhammed Sit et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the model's performance but does not specify datasets. The introduction provides context about the importance of streamflow prediction but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsection labeled **2.1. Dataset**. Here, the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that they utilized historical measurements from the **United States Geological Survey (USGS)** stream gauges, specifically detailing the selection of eight sensors in Johnson County, Iowa. This is a crucial piece of information as it indicates the dataset's source and context.

The authors provide specific details about the dataset, including:
- The temporal resolution of the measurements (15 minutes).
- The number of sensors used (eight).
- The date range for the data (from 10/1/2011 to 10/01/2018).
- The total number of snapshots created (47,938).

Additionally, they mention the aggregation of precipitation data from the **Stage IV hourly multi-sensor precipitation analysis**, which is also relevant for understanding the dataset's composition.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are derived from USGS and a precipitation analysis, I will focus on citing the relevant sources:

1. For the **USGS stream gauge data**, I will cite the USGS website as the source of the historical measurements:
   > United States Geological Survey. *National Water Information System: Web Interface*. [https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis).

2. For the **Stage IV hourly multi-sensor precipitation analysis**, I will cite the relevant source:
   > National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. *Stage IV Precipitation Data*. [https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
