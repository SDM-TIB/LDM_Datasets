To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bayesian Sparsification of Gated Recurrent Neural Networks" by Ekaterina Lobacheva et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details about their structure or purpose.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using two datasets for text classification: the **IMDb dataset** and the **AGNews dataset**. They also reference the **Penn Treebank corpus** for language modeling tasks. I will note down the details provided for each dataset, including their specific applications in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The citations I will extract are as follows:

1. For the **IMDb dataset**, the citation is:
   > Maas, A. L., Daly, R. E., Pham, P. T., Huang, D., Ng, A. Y., and Potts, C. (2011). Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies - Volume 1, pages 142–150.

2. For the **AGNews dataset**, the citation is:
   > Zhang, X., Zhao, J., and LeCun, Y. (2015). Character-level convolutional networks for text classification. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28: Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS).

3. For the **Penn Treebank corpus**, the citation is:
   > Marcus, M. P., Marcinkiewicz, M. A., and Santorini, B. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. Comput. Linguist., 19(2):313–330.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their full citations for reference.
