To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Retraining-Based Iterative Weight Quantization for Deep Neural Networks" by Dongsoo Lee and Byeongwook Kim, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the **Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset** for evaluating the proposed quantization techniques, which indicates that this dataset is relevant.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly focusing on the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention using the **PTB dataset** for their experiments, which is a well-known dataset in the field of natural language processing.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the PTB dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Marcus, M. P., Marcinkiewicz, M. A., & Santorini, B. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313-330.

Since the paper primarily discusses the PTB dataset, I will ensure to document this dataset thoroughly.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference.

In summary, the steps I will take are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Identify the relevant sections that discuss the datasets used in experiments.
3. Locate the full citation for the identified dataset in the references section.
4. Document the dataset details, including the citation, in a structured manner.

This approach will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the dataset used in the research paper.
