To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RWKV-TS: Beyond Traditional Recurrent Neural Network for Time Series Tasks" by Haowen Hou and F. Richard Yu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research problem.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for various tasks. This section is crucial as it usually lists the datasets explicitly and provides descriptions of their characteristics, such as the number of samples, features, and any specific attributes relevant to the experiments conducted.

In this paper, I will look for mentions of datasets in the context of different tasks such as **long-term forecasting, short-term forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation**. Each task may utilize different datasets, and I need to ensure I capture all relevant datasets mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is important as it allows me to provide proper attribution and context for each dataset. I will look for papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail, ensuring that I have the correct citation format.

For example, if the paper mentions the **Weather dataset**, I will find the corresponding citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> "Weather dataset: [Author(s)]. *Title of the dataset paper*. Year."

I will repeat this process for each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring that I capture the full citation for each one.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with proper citations for each.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper "RWKV-TS: Beyond Traditional Recurrent Neural Network for Time Series Tasks."
