To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accurate and Efficient Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection and Subtype Classification in 3D CT Scans with Convolutional and Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks" by Mihail Burduja et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **RSNA 2019 Brain CT Hemorrhage dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe the **RSNA 2019 Brain CT Hemorrhage dataset** in detail in **section 4.1 (Data Set)**. Here, they provide specific information about the dataset, including the number of CT examinations, the total number of CT slices, and the labeling of the slices.

The dataset is described as follows:
- **RSNA 2019 Brain CT Hemorrhage dataset**: This dataset consists of 25,272 CT examinations with a total of 870,301 CT slices. Each CT scan is labeled with five types of brain hemorrhage: epidural, intraparenchymal, intraventricular, subarachnoid, and subdural. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the RSNA dataset. The paper cites the dataset as follows:
> Flanders, A.E.; Prevedello, L.M.; Shih, G.; Halabi, S.S.; Kalpathy-Cramer, J.; Ball, R.; Mongan, J.T.; Stein, A.; Kitamura, F.C.; Lungren, M.P.; others. Construction of a Machine Learning Dataset through Collaboration: The RSNA 2019 Brain CT Hemorrhage Challenge. Radiology: Artificial Intelligence 2020, 2, e190211.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

In summary, I have identified the dataset used in the research paper and retrieved its full citation, which is crucial for proper documentation and referencing.
