To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Super Denoise Net: Speech Super Resolution with Noise Cancellation in Low Sampling Rate Noisy Environments" by Junkang Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using a dataset provided by the **Deep Noise Suppression (DNS) Challenge at ICASSP 2023**, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the dataset used. They mention that they synthesized clean and noisy speech pairs with a total of **500 hours** of data, which is crucial information. The authors specify that the data was generated by mixing speech and noise, and they provide details about the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sampling rate.

In this section, they also reference the **DNS Challenge 2020** for the testing phase, which indicates that this dataset is also relevant for evaluation purposes.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **DNS Challenge 2023**, the citation is:
   > Dubey et al., “Deep speech enhancement challenge at ICASSP 2023,” in ICASSP, 2023.

2. For the **DNS Challenge 2020**, the citation is:
   > Reddy et al., “The Interspeech 2020 Deep Noise Suppression Challenge: Datasets, Subjective Testing Framework, and Challenge Results,” in Proc. Interspeech, 2020, pp. 2492–2496.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets:

- **Dataset 1**: DNS Challenge 2023
  - Description: A dataset used to generate training data containing noise, synthesized from clean and noisy speech pairs totaling 500 hours.
  - Citation: Dubey et al., “Deep speech enhancement challenge at ICASSP 2023,” in ICASSP, 2023.

- **Dataset 2**: DNS Challenge 2020
  - Description: A dataset used for testing, which includes no reverb test samples.
  - Citation: Reddy et al., “The Interspeech 2020 Deep Noise Suppression Challenge: Datasets, Subjective Testing Framework, and Challenge Results,” in Proc. Interspeech, 2020, pp. 2492–2496.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
