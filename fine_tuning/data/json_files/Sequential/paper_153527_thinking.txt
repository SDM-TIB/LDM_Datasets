To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MnasFPN: Learning Latency-aware Pyramid Architecture for Object Detection on Mobile Devices" by Bo Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the research. The introduction often discusses the datasets used for evaluation, so I will pay close attention to any mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any subsection that discusses the experimental setup. In this paper, I will specifically check **section 4 (Experiments)**, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation.

In the experiments section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors refer to any standard benchmarks or datasets, I will note them down carefully.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **COCO dataset**, I will find the citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Piotr Dollar, Ross Girshick, Kaiming He, Bharath Hariharan, and Serge Belongie. *Feature Pyramid Networks for Object Detection*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 2117â€“2125, 2017.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I have accurately represented each dataset as per the requirements.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for any required output format, ensuring that all information is clear and correctly attributed.
