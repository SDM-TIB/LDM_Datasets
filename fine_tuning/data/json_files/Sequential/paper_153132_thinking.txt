To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Activity2Vec: Learning ADL Embeddings from Sensor Data with a Sequence-to-Sequence Model" by Alireza Ghods and Diane J. Cook, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study evaluates a method on datasets collected from wearable and ambient sensors, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for validation. Here, they describe two datasets:

1. **Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones (HAR) dataset**: This dataset is collected from 30 volunteers performing six scripted activities while wearing a smartphone. The authors provide details about the data collection process, including the sampling method and the partitioning of the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. **CASAS smart home dataset (HH101)**: This dataset consists of data collected from a single-resident home equipped with various sensors. The authors describe the structure of the data and how it was annotated for activity recognition.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **HAR dataset**, the citation is:
  > Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra, and Jorge Luis Reyes-Ortiz. *A public domain dataset for human activity recognition using smartphones*. In ESANN, 2013.

- For the **CASAS HH101 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Diane J Cook, Aaron S Crandall, Brian L Thomas, and Narayanan C Krishnan. *CASAS: A smart home in a box*. Computer 46, 7 (2013), 62â€“69.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation to ensure proper attribution.
