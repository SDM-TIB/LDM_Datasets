To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convolutional Embedding for Edit Distance" by Xinyan Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they mention conducting experiments on **five datasets**: UniRef, DBLP, Trec, Gen50ks, and Enron. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, such as the number of items, average length, and any specific characteristics that are relevant.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The citations may not always be directly provided in the text, so I will look for any papers or resources that describe these datasets in detail.

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following information:

1. **UniRef**: The authors describe it as containing 400,000 items with an average length of 446 characters. I will look for the original source or paper that introduced or describes the UniRef dataset.

2. **DBLP**: This dataset has 1,385,451 items and a maximum length of 35,214 characters. Again, I will find the appropriate citation for this dataset.

3. **Trec**: With 347,949 items, I will note its characteristics and find the citation.

4. **Gen50ks**: This dataset contains 50,001 items. I will ensure to find its citation as well.

5. **Enron**: This dataset has 245,567 items. I will look for its citation.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset. If the paper does not provide them directly, I will search for the original papers or resources that describe these datasets.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
