To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Comment Generation by Leveraging User-Generated Data" by Zhaojiang Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a framework for comment generation using user-generated data, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of comment generation and the importance of user engagement, but I need to look for specific datasets. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset they collected. They mention a large-scale Chinese dataset sourced from Tencent News, which includes four million real comments along with metadata. The details provided include:

- The dataset consists of 177,368 articles, each with an average of four comments.
- It includes metadata such as user upvote counts and article categories.
- The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.

This section provides a clear description of the dataset, but I need to ensure I have the full citation for the dataset.

To find the citation, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The authors cite a previous work that describes the dataset collection process. The relevant citation is:

- For the dataset from Tencent News, the citation is:
  > Lianhui Qin, Lemao Liu, Wei Bi, Yan Wang, Xiaojiang Liu, Zhiting Hu, Hai Zhao, and Shuming Shi. *Automatic article commenting: the task and dataset*. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers), pages 151â€“156, 2018.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset information clearly:

1. **Tencent News Dataset**: A large-scale dataset containing four million user comments and metadata from 177,368 articles, used for training a comment generation model.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset.
