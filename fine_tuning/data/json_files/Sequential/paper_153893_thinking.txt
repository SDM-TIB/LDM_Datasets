To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Progressive Automatic Design of Search Space for One-Shot Neural Architecture Search" by Xin Xia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset and Implementation Details)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors mention using the **ILSVRC2012 dataset** for their experiments. I will note down the specifics of this dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details provided.

In this section, the authors state that they used **50,000 images sampled from each class of the training set** for validation, and the original validation set is used as the test set. This information is crucial for understanding how the dataset was utilized in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ILSVRC2012 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li Jia Li, and Fei Fei Li. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In CVPR, 2009.

Since the paper primarily discusses the ILSVRC2012 dataset, I will compile this information into a structured format that captures the dataset's name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and ready for presentation or further processing. This systematic approach will help me effectively extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
