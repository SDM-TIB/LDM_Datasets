To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Compact Recurrent Neural Networks" by Zhiyun Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental details sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of compact RNNs and LSTMs on a "2,000-hr English Voice Search task," which suggests that there is a dataset involved, but I need to confirm the details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Details)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention two sets of experiments: one with RNNs on a medium-sized noisy training set of **300 thousand English-spoken utterances (300 hours)**, and another with LSTMs on a larger training set of **3 million utterances (2,000 hours)**. This indicates that both datasets are created by artificially corrupting clean utterances using a room simulator, which is important for understanding the context of the datasets.

I will also look for any specific names or references to the datasets in the **results section** or **acknowledgments** to ensure I capture all relevant information. However, it appears that the datasets are described in a general manner without specific names or citations.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets:

1. **English Voice Search Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,000 hours of English spoken utterances, used for training the LSTM models. The dataset is created by adding noise and reverberation to clean utterances, simulating real-world conditions.

2. **Noisy Training Set**: This dataset contains 300 thousand English-spoken utterances (300 hours), also created by corrupting clean utterances with noise and reverberation.

Since the paper does not provide specific citations for these datasets, I will note that they are derived from Googleâ€™s voice search traffic, but I will not be able to provide formal citations as they are not explicitly mentioned in the references.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the relevant details about each dataset, even if formal citations are not available.

In conclusion, I will document the datasets as follows:
- **English Voice Search Dataset**: 2,000 hours of English spoken utterances, created by adding noise and reverberation.
- **Noisy Training Set**: 300 thousand English-spoken utterances (300 hours), created similarly.

This approach ensures that I have thoroughly extracted and documented the datasets mentioned in the paper, even in the absence of formal citations.
