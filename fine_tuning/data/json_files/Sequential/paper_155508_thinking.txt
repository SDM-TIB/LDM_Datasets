To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalized Data Distribution Iteration" by Jiajun Fan and Changnan Xiao, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a summary of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets, which can help identify them.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**, particularly in subsections that describe experiments or evaluations. This section typically outlines the datasets used for training and testing the proposed methods. I will pay attention to any figures, tables, or references to datasets that may be included in this section.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any performance metrics or comparisons based on these datasets. This can help confirm the relevance and importance of the datasets mentioned.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for others to locate the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)** as a dataset, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly referenced.

Finally, I will summarize my findings, ensuring that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
