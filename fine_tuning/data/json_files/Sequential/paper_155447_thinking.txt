To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fitting Generalized Tempered Stable Distribution: Fractional Fourier Transform (FRFT) Approach" by A.H. Nzokem and V.T. Montshiwa, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors performed empirical analysis using data from the **S&P 500 index, SPY ETF, and Bitcoin BTC**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for the study.

Next, I will focus on the **data and methodology section** (section 3), where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. They mention:

1. **S&P 500 Index**: This dataset tracks the share prices of 500 of the largest public companies in the United States. The data was extracted from Yahoo Finance, covering the period from January 4, 2010, to February 2, 2022.

2. **SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY ETF)**: This dataset mirrors the performance of the S&P 500 and was also sourced from Yahoo Finance for the same period.

3. **Bitcoin BTC**: The price data for Bitcoin was extracted from CoinMarketCap, covering the period from April 28, 2013, to April 8, 2022.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for their statistical analysis, which further validates their importance.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are widely recognized financial indices and instruments, they may not have formal citations like academic papers. Instead, I will provide a description of how to reference them:

- For the **S&P 500 Index**:
  > Standard & Poor's. *S&P 500 Index*. Available at: [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/) (Accessed: February 2, 2022).

- For the **SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY ETF)**:
  > State Street Global Advisors. *SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust*. Available at: [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/) (Accessed: February 2, 2022).

- For **Bitcoin BTC**:
  > CoinMarketCap. *Bitcoin (BTC) Price*. Available at: [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) (Accessed: April 8, 2022).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the dataset names, descriptions, and citations. This will ensure that the datasets are clearly documented for future reference or analysis.
