To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Microsoft 2017 Conversational Speech Recognition System" by W. Xiong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the system's improvements and mentions the Switchboard speech recognition task, which suggests that datasets related to this task may be discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section (Section 4)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they mention that the data sets used for system training consist of the public and shared datasets used in the DARPA research community. Specifically, they state that acoustic training used the **English CTS (Switchboard and Fisher) corpora**.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the context of language model training. The authors note that language model training utilized the **English CallHome transcripts**, the **BBN Switchboard-2 transcripts**, the **LDC Hub4 (Broadcast News) corpus**, and the **UW conversational web corpus**. 

Now, I will compile the full citations for each of these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **Switchboard Corpus**: 
   > J. J. Godfrey, E. C. Holliman, and J. McDaniel. *Switchboard: Telephone speech corpus for research and development*. In Proceedings of the IEEE ICASSP, vol. 1, pp. 517–520, 1992.

2. **Fisher Corpus**: 
   > G. Saon, H.-K. J. Kuo, S. Rennie, and M. Picheny. *The telephone speech recognition system*. In Proceedings of the IEEE ICASSP, pp. 3140–3144, 2015.

3. **CallHome Transcripts**: 
   > LDC. *CallHome American English Speech*. Linguistic Data Consortium, 1996.

4. **BBN Switchboard-2 Transcripts**: 
   > LDC. *Switchboard-2 Corpus*. Linguistic Data Consortium, 1998.

5. **LDC Hub4 (Broadcast News) Corpus**: 
   > LDC. *Hub4 Broadcast News Corpus*. Linguistic Data Consortium, 1997.

6. **UW Conversational Web Corpus**: 
   > I. Bulyko, M. Ostendorf, and A. Stolcke. *Getting more mileage from web text sources for conversational speech language modeling using class-dependent mixtures*. In Proceedings of HLT-NAACL, pp. 7–9, 2003.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation. This will facilitate further processing or review of the datasets used in the research.
