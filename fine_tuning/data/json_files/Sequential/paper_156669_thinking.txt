To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Systematic Review: Anomaly Detection in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles" by John Roar Ventura Solaas, Nilufer Tuptuk, and Enrico Mariconti, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the review focuses on anomaly detection in connected and autonomous vehicles, which suggests that datasets related to vehicle data may be discussed.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **results section**, particularly in **Table II**, which provides an overview of datasets used in anomaly detection models. This table is likely to contain valuable information about the datasets, including their names and characteristics.

Upon reviewing Table II, I find several datasets listed, including:

1. **Car-Hacking Dataset**: This dataset is used for intrusion detection in vehicle networks and is referenced in multiple studies.
2. **SPMD (Safety Pilot Model Deployment) Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating safety in connected vehicles.
3. **OTIDS (Onboard Traffic Intrusion Detection System) Dataset**: This dataset is focused on CAN bus data for intrusion detection.
4. **KITTI Dataset**: A well-known dataset for autonomous driving research, particularly in computer vision tasks.
5. **UNSW-NB15 Dataset**: A dataset used for network intrusion detection, which may also be relevant for vehicle cybersecurity.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers who may want to access these datasets.

The citations I find are:

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, including their names, characteristics, and full citations, ensuring that I provide a comprehensive overview that adheres to the requirements of the task. This will facilitate further research and validation in the field of anomaly detection for connected and autonomous vehicles.
