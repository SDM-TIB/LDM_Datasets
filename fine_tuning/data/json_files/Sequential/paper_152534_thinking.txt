To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Finding the Answers With Definition Models" by Jack Parry, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions improvements to a deﬁnition model and the inclusion of crossword questions and answers in the training data, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look closely at **section 2.1 (Data)**, where the author discusses the data gathered for experiments. Here, I will find specific details about the datasets used, including the training and test sets. The author mentions that the training data consists of approximately 850,000 head-gloss pairs and outlines the creation of four test sets:

1. **Seen set**: 500 word definition pairs taken from training data.
2. **Unseen set**: 500 dictionary definitions for unseen head words.
3. **Concept descriptions**: 200 user-generated definitions for head words in vocabulary.
4. **Crossword set**: 200 general knowledge crossword questions taken from a crossword website.

Additionally, I will note that the author has gathered crossword questions and answers from two sources, which are summarized in **section 5.3 (Crossword Answering Tasks)**. The datasets mentioned include:

- A dataset from a GitHub repository containing approximately 600,000 clues and answers from the New York Times crosswords.
- A dataset of approximately 120,000 clues and answers gathered from The Guardian website.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets by referring to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Word2Vec embeddings** used in the experiments:
  > Mikolov, T., Chen, K., Corrado, G., & Dean, J. (2013). Efficient estimation of word representations in vector space. arXiv preprint arXiv:1301.3781.

- For the **GloVe embeddings** used in the experiments:
  > Pennington, J., Socher, R., & Manning, C. (2014). GloVe: Global vectors for word representation. In Proceedings of the 2014 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing (EMNLP) (pp. 1532–1543).

- For the **crossword datasets**:
  > The Guardian crossword data was gathered from the website (now unavailable).
  > The New York Times crossword data was sourced from a GitHub repository (Donohoe, 2018).

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations for future use.
