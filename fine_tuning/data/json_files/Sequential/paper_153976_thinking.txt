To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Differentiable Neural Architecture Transformation for Reproducible Architecture Improvement" by Do-Guk Kim and Heung-Chang Lee, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on **two datasets, CIFAR-10 and Tiny Imagenet**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Data and Experiment Setting)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images across ten classes, with each image having a size of 32 × 32 pixels and RGB color channels.

2. **Tiny Imagenet**: This dataset contains 100,000 training images and 10,000 test images across 200 classes, with each image sized at 64 × 64 pixels and also in RGB color.

The authors confirm that these datasets were used for their experiments, which is essential for validating the results.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, CIFAR-10 and Tiny Imagenet are well-known datasets, and their citations are typically available in the literature. 

For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: Canadian Institute for Advanced Research*. 2009.

For **Tiny Imagenet**, the citation is:
> Tiny ImageNet Challenge. *Stanford University*. 2017. Available at: http://tiny-imagenet.herokuapp.com/

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring they are structured correctly for any further processing or review.
