To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Human Pose Transfer by Adaptive Hierarchical Deformation" by Jinsong Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of human pose transfer and mentions the use of a dataset for experimental validation, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section (Section 4)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using the **DeepFashion dataset** for their experiments, which is a significant dataset for evaluating their method.

I will look for specific details about the dataset, such as its size, the type of data it contains, and any relevant characteristics. The authors state that the DeepFashion dataset contains **52,712 images** with a resolution of **256 × 256** and that it has been used to collect training and testing pairs.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DeepFashion dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- For **DeepFashion dataset**:
  > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Qiu, S., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2016). DeepFashion: Powering robust clothes recognition and retrieval with rich annotations. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 1096–1104.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the DeepFashion dataset is the primary dataset used in this research.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
