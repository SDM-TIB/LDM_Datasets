To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Logic Constrained Pointer Networks for Interpretable Textual Similarity" by Subhadeep Maji et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the model achieves results on benchmark SemEval datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will look for explicit mentions of dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics.

In this case, the authors mention the **SemEval 2016 Task 2 dataset** for interpretable semantic textual similarity. They describe it as consisting of examples from two domains: News Headlines and Flickr Images, with a total of 1,125 sentence pairs annotated with alignments between chunks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SemEval datasets mentioned. The relevant citation for the SemEval 2016 Task 2 dataset is:

- For the SemEval 2016 Task 2 dataset, the citation is:
  > Eneko Agirre, Aitor Gonzalez-Agirre, Inigo Lopez-Gazpio, Montse Maritxalar, German Rigau, and Larraitz Uria. *Semeval-2016 task 2: Interpretable semantic textual similarity*. In SemEval, pages 512â€“524, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
