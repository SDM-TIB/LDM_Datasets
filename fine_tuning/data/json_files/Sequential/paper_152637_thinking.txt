To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Augmenting Neural Response Generation with Context-Aware Topical Attention" by Nouha Dziri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets section** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected a conversational dataset from Reddit comments, which suggests that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention the following datasets:

1. **Reddit Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as a collection of 35 million conversations drawn from Reddit, composed of posts and comments. They specify that the dataset was curated from 95 English subreddits and processed over a 12-month period. They also mention that they randomly sampled 6 million dialogues for training, 700,000 for development, and 40,000 for testing.

2. **OpenSubtitles Dataset**: The authors mention that they also trained their models on the OpenSubtitles dataset, which is noted to lack speaker annotations, making it less suitable for dialogue systems.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Reddit Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pushshift.io. *Reddit Dataset*. Available at: https://files.pushshift.io/reddit/

- For the **OpenSubtitles Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jörg Tiedemann. *Parallel data, tools and interfaces in OPUS*. In LREC, volume 2012, pages 2214–2218, 2012.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are clearly defined and ready for any further processing or review.
