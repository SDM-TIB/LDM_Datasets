To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RoboMal: Malware Detection for Robot Network Systems" by Upinder Kaur et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions the creation of the **RoboMal dataset**, which is a strong indication that this is the primary dataset discussed in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section III (The RoboMal Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. Here, they explain that the RoboMal dataset consists of 450 binary executable files, including 232 malware files and 218 good software files, specifically designed for small-scale autonomous cars. This section will provide essential details about the dataset's composition and purpose.

In this section, the authors also mention the availability of the dataset at a specific DOI link (https://doi.org/10.4231/YN7G-H807), which is crucial for citation purposes. I will ensure to note this link as it provides access to the dataset.

After gathering the dataset details, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the RoboMal dataset. Since the dataset is created by the authors of the paper, I will cite it as follows:

- **RoboMal Dataset**: 
  > Upinder Kaur, Haozhe Zhou, Xiaxin Shen, Byung-Cheol Min, and Richard M. Voyles. *RoboMal: Malware Detection for Robot Network Systems*. Accepted to IRC 2021. Available at: https://doi.org/10.4231/YN7G-H807.

Now that I have the necessary information about the dataset and its citation, I will compile this into a structured format for further use or processing. This includes ensuring that I have captured the dataset's name, description, and citation accurately.
