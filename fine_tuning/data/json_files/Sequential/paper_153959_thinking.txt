To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Physically constrained short-term vehicle trajectory forecasting with naive semantic maps" by Albert Dulian and John C. Murray, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the model is trained and validated on a publicly available dataset that provides data from urban areas. This indicates that a dataset is indeed used, but I need to find its specific name.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the complexity of urban environments and the need for accurate predictions, but it does not specify any dataset names.

I will then focus on the **data and methodology** section, particularly subsection 3.4, where the authors mention using the **nuScenes dataset**. This dataset is described as containing 3D bounding box annotation data of agents within urban scenes, which is crucial for the model's training.

In the **experiments and results** section, the authors confirm that they conducted experiments using the **nuScenes dataset**. This reinforces that this is the primary dataset utilized in their research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the nuScenes dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yu Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *nuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.11027, 2019.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **nuScenes Dataset**: This dataset is used for training and validating the proposed model, providing essential data from urban environments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation, ensuring that it is ready for any structured output or further processing.
