To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Phased LSTM: Accelerating Recurrent Network Training for Long or Event-based Sequences" by Daniel Neil, Michael Pfeiffer, and Shih-Chii Liu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the Phased LSTM model and its advantages but does not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction provides context about RNNs and their applications, but I need to look deeper for specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, particularly the subsections where experiments are described. In section 3.3, the authors mention using the **N-MNIST dataset** for testing performance on real-world asynchronously sampled data. This dataset is crucial for understanding the model's capabilities with event-based visual recognition.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the N-MNIST dataset. The relevant citation is:
> G. Orchard, A. Jayawant, G. Cohen, and N. Thakor. *Converting static image datasets to spiking neuromorphic datasets using saccades*. arXiv: 1507.07629, 2015.

Additionally, in section 3.4, the authors refer to the **GRID dataset** for a lip reading task. This dataset is also important for the experiments conducted in the paper.

I will look for the citation for the GRID dataset in the references section, which is:
> M. Cooke, J. Barker, S. Cunningham, and X. Shao. *An audio-visual corpus for speech perception and automatic speech recognition*. The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 120(5):2421â€“2424, 2006.

Now, I have identified two datasets used in the paper: the N-MNIST dataset and the GRID dataset. I will compile the information about these datasets, including their descriptions and full citations, to ensure that I have captured all necessary details.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that the citations are correctly formatted and complete.
