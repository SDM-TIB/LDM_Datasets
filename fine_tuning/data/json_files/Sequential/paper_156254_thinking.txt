To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion Variational Autoencoder for Tackling Stochasticity in Multi-Step Regression Stock Price Prediction" by Kelvin J.L. Koa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using stock price data, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Experiment Settings)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **ACL18 StockNet Dataset**: This dataset contains historical prices of 88 high trade volume stocks from the U.S. market, covering the period from January 1, 2014, to January 1, 2017. It is noted as a popular benchmark in stock prediction literature.

2. **Extended U.S. Stock Data**: The authors collected updated stock data from January 1, 2017, to January 1, 2023, which includes the top 10 stocks from 11 major industries. This dataset is derived from Yahoo Finance and is processed similarly to the ACL18 dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors summarize the statistics of the datasets, indicating that they split the extended dataset into three parts for evaluation, corresponding to the years 2016, 2019, and 2022.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets, but I can infer the following based on the context:

- For the **ACL18 StockNet Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yumo Xu and Shay B. Cohen. *Stock Movement Prediction from Tweets and Historical Prices*. In Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING), pages 1970â€“1979, 2018.

- For the **Yahoo Finance data**, while it is not a formal dataset citation, I can note that the data is publicly available and can be referenced as:
  > Yahoo Finance. *Historical Stock Data*. Available at: https://finance.yahoo.com/.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
