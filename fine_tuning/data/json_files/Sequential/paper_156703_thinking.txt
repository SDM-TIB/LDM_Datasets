To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Filtered Corpus Training (FiCT) Shows that Language Models can Generalize from Indirect Evidence" by Abhinav Patil et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract introduces the concept of Filtered Corpus Training and mentions that the methodology is applied to both LSTM and Transformer language models, which suggests that datasets are involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section** where the authors describe the FiCT method in detail. Here, they mention using the **BLiMP benchmark** (Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs) as a primary means of evaluation. This benchmark consists of 67 different benchmarks targeting various linguistic phenomena, which indicates that it serves as a dataset for their experiments.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors specify that they used the **English Wikipedia corpus** as the base training, validation, and test corpora. They mention that the training corpus consists of 3.05 million sentences and 83 million tokens, which is crucial information for dataset documentation.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **BLiMP Benchmark**: The citation for the BLiMP benchmark is:
   > Alex Warstadt, Alicia Parrish, Haokun Liu, Anhad Mohananey, Wei Peng, Sheng-Fu Wang, and Samuel R. Bowman. *BLiMP: The benchmark of linguistic minimal pairs for English*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 8:377–392, 2020.

2. **English Wikipedia Corpus**: The citation for the English Wikipedia corpus is:
   > Kristina Gulordava, Piotr Bojanowski, Edouard Grave, Tal Linzen, and Marco Baroni. *Colorless green recurrent networks dream hierarchically*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 1195–1205, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I accurately document each dataset with its respective citation, as this is essential for proper attribution and further research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or downstream processing, ensuring that all relevant details are included for each dataset identified in the paper.
