To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Transfer Learning for Source Code Modeling" by Yasir Hussain et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of transfer learning in source code modeling, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Proposed Approach)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Transfer Learning)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used to pre-train their models. Here, they mention that they gathered data from various Java projects, which is crucial for identifying the datasets.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide a detailed list of projects used for pre-training the models, including:

1. **Apache Ant**: Version 1.10.5, with 149,960 lines of code and a total of 920,978 code tokens.
2. **Apache Cassandra**: Version 3.11.3, with 318,704 lines of code and a total of 2,734,218 code tokens.
3. **db40**: Version 7.2, with 241,766 lines of code and a total of 1,435,382 code tokens.
4. **JGit**: Version 5.1.3, with 199,505 lines of code and a total of 1,538,905 code tokens.
5. **Apache POI**: Version 4.0.0, with 387,203 lines of code and a total of 2,876,253 code tokens.
6. **Apache Maven**: Version 3.6.0, with 69,840 lines of code and a total of 494,379 code tokens.
7. **Apache Batik**: Version 1.10.0, with 195,652 lines of code and a total of 1,246,157 code tokens.
8. **JTS**: Version 1.16.0, with 91,387 lines of code and a total of 611,392 code tokens.
9. **iText**: Version 5.5.13, with 161,185 lines of code and a total of 1,164,362 code tokens.
10. **ANTLR**: Version 4.7.1, with 56,085 lines of code and a total of 407,248 code tokens.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are derived from open-source projects, I will cite the projects themselves rather than looking for specific papers. The citations will include the project name, version, and a link to their respective repositories.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations:

- **Apache Ant**: 
  > Apache Ant. *Apache Ant 1.10.5*. Available at: https://ant.apache.org/

- **Apache Cassandra**: 
  > Apache Cassandra. *Apache Cassandra 3.11.3*. Available at: https://cassandra.apache.org/

- **db40**: 
  > db40. *db40 7.2*. Available at: https://github.com/db40/db40

- **JGit**: 
  > JGit. *JGit 5.1.3*. Available at: https://www.eclipse.org/jgit/

- **Apache POI**: 
  > Apache POI. *Apache POI 4.0.0*. Available at: https://poi.apache.org/

- **Apache Maven**: 
  > Apache Maven. *Apache Maven 3.6.0*. Available at: https://maven.apache.org/

- **Apache Batik**: 
  > Apache Batik. *Apache Batik 1.10.0*. Available at: https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/

- **JTS**: 
  > JTS. *JTS 1.16.0*. Available at: https://locationtech.github.io/jts/

- **iText**: 
  > iText. *iText 5.5.13*. Available at: https://itextpdf.com/

- **ANTLR**: 
  > ANTLR. *ANTLR 4.7.1*. Available at: https://www.antlr.org/

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are structured correctly for any further processing or review.
