To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DA-NAS: Data Adapted Pruning for Efficient Neural Architecture Search" by Xiyang Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **ImageNet** and **COCO key-point 2017 dataset**, which indicates that these are likely the primary datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors explicitly state that they used the **full ImageNet dataset** for image classification tasks and the **full COCO key-point 2017 dataset** for key-point localization tasks. This confirms that both datasets are integral to their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **ImageNet dataset**, the citation is:
   > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.J., Li, K., Fei-Fei, L. "ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database." In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

2. For the **COCO key-point 2017 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., Zitnick, C.L. "Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context." In Computer Vision – ECCV 2014, pp. 740–755. Springer International Publishing, 2014.

Having gathered this information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- **ImageNet**: A large-scale hierarchical image database used for image classification tasks.
- **COCO key-point 2017**: A dataset used for key-point localization tasks.

I will now compile these dataset entries into the required structured format for further processing.
