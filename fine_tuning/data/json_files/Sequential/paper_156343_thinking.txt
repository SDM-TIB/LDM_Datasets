To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ZEST: Attention-based Zero-Shot Learning for Unseen IoT Device Classification" by Binghui Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and performance evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on real IoT traffic data, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **performance evaluation section** where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their evaluations. In this section, they state that they carried out evaluations on the **UNSW 2018 dataset**. This is a significant dataset as it is described as being relatively large (27 GB) and containing data from 28 device types.

I will then look for a detailed description of the dataset, which is provided in the performance evaluation section. The authors mention that the dataset consists of raw pcap data collected over 61 days and that they used only the 12 device classes with the most data points for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the UNSW 2018 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> A. Sivanathan, H. H. Gharakheili, F. Loi, A. Radford, C. Wijenayake, A. Vishwanath, and V. Sivaraman. "Classifying IoT Devices in Smart Environments Using Network Traffic Characteristics." IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, vol. 18, no. 8, pp. 1745–1759, 2018.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction process:

1. **Dataset Name**: UNSW 2018 dataset
   - **Description**: A large dataset (27 GB) containing raw pcap data collected over 61 days, featuring 28 device types. The authors used only the 12 device classes with the most data points for their experiments.
   - **Full Citation**: A. Sivanathan, H. H. Gharakheili, F. Loi, A. Radford, C. Wijenayake, A. Vishwanath, and V. Sivaraman. "Classifying IoT Devices in Smart Environments Using Network Traffic Characteristics." IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, vol. 18, no. 8, pp. 1745–1759, 2018.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
