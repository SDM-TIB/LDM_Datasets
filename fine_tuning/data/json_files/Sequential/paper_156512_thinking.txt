To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online Speaker Diarization of Meetings Guided by Speech Separation" by Elio Gruttadauria et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of the **AMI corpus**, which indicates that this dataset is likely central to the research.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly state the datasets used for training and evaluation. They mention the following datasets:

1. **AMI Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed models, specifically focusing on the headset mix in single-microphone settings. The AMI dataset is a well-known corpus for meeting recordings.

2. **LibriMix Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for training the speech separation models. The authors specify that they used the "mix both" type of LibriMix, which is designed for generalizable speech separation tasks.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets to ensure proper attribution:

- For the **AMI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > I. McCowan, J. Carletta, W. Kraaij, S. Ashby, S. Bourban, M. Flynn et al. "The AMI meeting corpus," 2005.

- For the **LibriMix Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Cosentino, M. Pariente, S. Cornell, A. Deleforge, and E. Vincent. "LibriMix: An Open-Source Dataset for Generalizable Speech Separation," 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited in any subsequent analysis or application.
