To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transferable Graph Optimizers for ML Compilers" by Yanqi Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed method on various graph optimization tasks, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail. This section typically contains information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any references to specific datasets or benchmarks that the authors used to validate their method. 

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using computational graphs from various architectures, specifically:

1. **LSTM-based RNN Language Model**: This is a type of model architecture rather than a dataset, but it indicates the type of data used.
2. **GNMT (Google Neural Machine Translation)**: Again, this refers to a model architecture.
3. **Transformer-XL**: This is another model architecture.
4. **InceptionV3**: This is a well-known model architecture used in computer vision.
5. **AmoebaNet**: This is also a model architecture.
6. **WaveNet**: This is a generative model for audio.

The paper does not explicitly mention datasets in the traditional sense (like "CIFAR-10" or "ImageNet"). Instead, it refers to the computational graphs derived from these architectures. Therefore, I will need to look for any references in the **References section** that might provide more context or citations related to these architectures.

After reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite various papers that describe these architectures. I will extract the relevant citations for each architecture mentioned:

- For **LSTM-based RNN Language Model**, the citation is:
  > Wojciech Zaremba, Ilya Sutskever, and Oriol Vinyals. *Recurrent Neural Network Regularization*. CoRR, abs/1409.2329, 2014.

- For **GNMT**, the citation is:
  > Ilya Sutskever, Oriol Vinyals, and Quoc V. Le. *Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks*. CoRR, abs/1409.3215, 2014.

- For **Transformer-XL**, the citation is:
  > Zihang Dai, Zhilin Yang, Yiming Yang, Jaime G. Carbonell, Quoc V. Le, and Ruslan Salakhutdinov. *Transformer-XL: Attentive Language Models Beyond a Fixed-Length Context*. ACL, 2019.

- For **InceptionV3**, the citation is:
  > Christian Szegedy, Vincent Vanhoucke, Sergey Ioffe, Jonathon Shlens, and Zbigniew Wojna. *Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision*. CoRR, abs/1512.00567, 2015.

- For **AmoebaNet**, the citation is:
  > Esteban Real, Alok Aggarwal, Yanping Huang, and Quoc V. Le. *Regularized Evolution for Image Classifier Architecture Search*. CoRR, abs/1802.01548, 2018.

- For **WaveNet**, the citation is:
  > AÃ¤ron van den Oord, Sander Dieleman, Heiga Zen, Karen Simonyan, Oriol Vinyals, Alex Graves, Nal Kalchbrenner, Andrew W. Senior, and Koray Kavukcuoglu. *Wavenet: A Generative Model for Raw Audio*. CoRR, abs/1609.03499, 2016.

Now that I have identified the relevant architectures and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. Each architecture serves as a proxy for the datasets used in the experiments, as they are derived from specific computational graphs associated with these models.
