To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequence-to-Sequence Mixture Model for Diverse Machine Translation" by Xuanli He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional sequence-to-sequence models and the need for diverse datasets to improve translation quality. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets at this point.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail their methodology and the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention conducting experiments on TED talks for four language pairs: English to French, English to German, English to Vietnamese, and English to Spanish. They specify the datasets used for these experiments:

1. **IWSLT14 Dataset**: Used for the English to Spanish translation task. The authors mention that this dataset contains 208,719 training pairs.
   
2. **IWSLT15 Dataset**: Used for the English to Vietnamese translation task, with 133,317 training pairs.

3. **IWSLT16 Dataset**: Used for the English to French and English to German translation tasks, with 189,600 training pairs for German and 173,601 for French.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **IWSLT14 Dataset**:
  > IWSLT. *International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation 2014*. Available at: https://sites.google.com/site/iwsltevaluation2014/home

- For the **IWSLT15 Dataset**:
  > IWSLT. *International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation 2015*. Available at: https://sites.google.com/site/iwsltevaluation2015/home

- For the **IWSLT16 Dataset**:
  > IWSLT. *International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation 2016*. Available at: https://sites.google.com/site/iwsltevaluation2016/home

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details are captured and properly attributed.
