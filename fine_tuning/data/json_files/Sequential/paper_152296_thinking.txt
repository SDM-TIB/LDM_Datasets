To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequence To Sequence Learning For Unconstrained Scene Text Recognition" by Ahmed Mamdouh, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **ICDAR 2013 test set** for evaluation, which indicates that this is one of the datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this case, I find that the author explicitly mentions using two datasets:

1. **ICDAR 2013 Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method. It consists of 1439 images focused on reading text in real scenes.

2. **Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset is part of the visual geometry group work and contains 9 million images covering 90,000 English words. It is used to enrich the training set for the model.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **ICDAR 2013 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. Karatzas, F. Shafait, S. Uchida, M. Iwamura, S. R. Mestre, L. G. i Bigorda, J. Mas, D. F. Mota, J. Almazan, and L. P. de las Heras. *ICDAR 2013 robust reading competition*. In ICDAR, pages 1484â€“1493, 2013.

- For the **Synthetic Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jaderberg, Max, et al. *Synthetic data and artificial neural networks for natural scene text recognition*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1406.2227, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
