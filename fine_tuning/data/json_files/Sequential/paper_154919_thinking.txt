To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Correcting Arabic Soft Spelling Mistakes using BiLSTM-based Machine Learning" by Gheith A. Abandah et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, while the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experimental setup section (Section 4)**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets they utilized for training and testing their models. I will look for any subsections that specifically address datasets, as they often contain detailed descriptions.

The paper mentions two datasets:

1. **Tashkeela Corpus**: This is described as a processed subset containing 55K sequences from classical Arabic texts. It is crucial to note that this dataset is used for training the BiLSTM models.

2. **Arabic Treebank Part 3 (ATB3)**: This dataset consists of samples of modern standard Arabic, specifically from 599 distinct news-wire stories from the Lebanese publication An-Nahar. It is also used for training and validation of the models.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For the **Tashkeela Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Abandah, G. A., Khedher, M. Z., Anati, W., Zghoul, A., Ababneh, S., & Hattab, M. S. (2015). The Arabic language status in the Jordanian social networking and mobile phone communications. In *7th Int’l Conference on Information Technology (ICIT 2015)*, pages 449–456.

- For the **Arabic Treebank Part 3 (ATB3)**, the citation is:
  > Maamouri, M., Bies, A., Buckwalter, T., & Mekki, W. (2004). The Penn Arabic treebank: Building a large-scale annotated Arabic corpus. In *NEMLAR Conference on Arabic Language Resources and Tools*, volume 27, pages 466–467.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
