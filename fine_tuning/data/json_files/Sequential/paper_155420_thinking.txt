To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LSTM-Autoencoder based Anomaly Detection for Indoor Air Quality Time Series Data" by Yuanyuan Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of the **Dunedin CO2 time-series dataset**, which indicates that this is a key dataset for the research. I will note this down as it is likely to be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experiments sections** to find more information about the dataset. In the **Methodology** section, the authors describe the **Dunedin CO2 Dataset** in detail, including how it was collected and the context of its use. They mention that the dataset was obtained from a real-world deployment of SKOMOBO boxes in schools in Dunedin, New Zealand, and that it contains CO2 readings collected over four months.

I will also check the **data processing** section to confirm the specifics of the dataset, such as the number of readings and the time intervals at which data was collected. The paper states that the dataset includes 247,263 CO2 readings collected at 1-minute intervals.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the Dunedin CO2 dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from a real-world deployment and not a standalone publication, I will note that the dataset is associated with the SKOMOBO project, which is referenced in the paper.

The relevant citation for the SKOMOBO project is:
> Wang, Y., Boulic, M., Phipps, R., Chitty, C., Moses, A., Weyers, R., Jang-Jaccard, J., Olivares, G., Ponder-Sutton, A., & Cunningham, C. (2017). Integrating open-source technologies to build a school indoor air quality monitoring box (SKOMOBO). In *2017 4th Asia-Pacific World Congress on Computer Science and Engineering (APWC on CSE)* (pp. 216–223). IEEE.

Finally, I will compile the information I have gathered about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **Dunedin CO2 Dataset**: A dataset containing CO2 readings collected from multiple primary/secondary schools in Dunedin, New Zealand, over a period of four months at 1-minute intervals.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Wang, Y., Boulic, M., Phipps, R., Chitty, C., Moses, A., Weyers, R., Jang-Jaccard, J., Olivares, G., Ponder-Sutton, A., & Cunningham, C. (2017). Integrating open-source technologies to build a school indoor air quality monitoring box (SKOMOBO). In *2017 4th Asia-Pacific World Congress on Computer Science and Engineering (APWC on CSE)* (pp. 216–223). IEEE.

Now, I will prepare to format this information according to the specified requirements for further processing.
