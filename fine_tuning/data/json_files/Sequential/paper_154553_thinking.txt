To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond Fully-Connected Layers with Quaternions: Parameterization of Hypercomplex Multiplications with 1/n Parameters" by Aston Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context of the research and may reference datasets that are critical to the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments on various tasks, which typically involve specific datasets. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize experimental results, as they often include the names of datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention conducting experiments on several tasks, including natural language inference, machine translation, text style transfer, and subject-verb agreement. They specifically list the datasets used for these tasks:

1. **Natural Language Inference Datasets**:
   - **MultiNLI**: Williams et al., 2017.
   - **QNLI**: Wang et al., 2017.
   - **SNLI**: Bowman et al., 2015.
   - **Dialogue NLI**: Welleck et al., 2018.
   - **SciTail**: Khot et al., 2018.

2. **Machine Translation Datasets**:
   - **IWSLT’15 English-Vietnamese**.
   - **IWSLT’17 English-Indonesian**.
   - **IWSLT’14 German-English**.
   - **IWSLT’14 Romanian-English**.
   - **WMT’18 English-Estonian**.
   - **Setimes English-Macedonian**.
   - **WMT’18 English-Romanian**.

3. **Text Style Transfer Dataset**:
   - **Modern Shakespeare Corpus**: This dataset is used for converting modern writing into Shakespearean style.

4. **Subject-Verb Agreement Dataset**: The dataset used for this task is referenced as being available online (Linzen et al., 2016).

After identifying these datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that each dataset is properly cited with its full citation.
