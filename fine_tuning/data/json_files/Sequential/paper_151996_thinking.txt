To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Person Re-Identification with Vision and Language" by Fei Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors introduce new annotations for two standard Re-ID benchmarks, specifically **CUHK03** and **VIPeR**. This suggests that these datasets are central to the research.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Natural Language Descriptions)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they mention that CUHK03 contains 13,164 images of 1,360 identities captured by 6 surveillance cameras, and that VIPeR consists of 1,264 images of 632 subjects captured with 2 cameras. This section confirms the datasets used in their experiments.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see how these datasets were utilized. The authors perform experiments on both CUHK03 and VIPeR, which reinforces their importance in the study.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **CUHK03**, the citation is:
   > Li, W., Zhao, R., Xiao, T., & Wang, X. (2014). Deep filter pairing neural network for person re-identification. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2014.

2. For **VIPeR**, the citation is:
   > Gray, D., Brennan, S., & Tao, H. (2007). Evaluating appearance models for recognition, reacquisition, and tracking. In International Workshop on Performance Evaluation for Tracking and Surveillance.

Having gathered this information, I will now summarize the datasets:

- **CUHK03**: A large dataset with 13,164 images of 1,360 identities, captured by 6 cameras.
- **VIPeR**: A challenging dataset with 1,264 images of 632 subjects, captured by 2 cameras.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or processing.
