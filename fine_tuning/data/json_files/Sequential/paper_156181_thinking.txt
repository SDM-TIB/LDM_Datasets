To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Perturbing a Neural Network to Infer Effective Connectivity: Evidence from Synthetic EEG Data" by Peizhen Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors used synthetic EEG data generated by a biological-plausible Jansen-Rit model, which indicates that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsection titled **4.3 Synthetic EEG data**. Here, the authors describe the generation of two datasets:

1. **A simple Jansen-Rit synthesized dataset**: This dataset consists of 3 regions with pre-defined connections, serving as a proof-of-concept for their framework.

2. **A Jansen-Rit synthesized dataset with 90 regions**: This dataset is based on real structural connectivity measured from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and includes 90 brain regions.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their models on these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the original work related to the Jansen-Rit model:

- For the **Jansen-Rit model**, the citation is:
  > Coronel-Oliveros, C., Cofr√©, R., & Orio, P. (2021). Cholinergic neuromodulation of inhibitory interneurons facilitates functional integration in whole-brain models. *PLoS Computational Biology*, 17(2), e1008737.

Since the authors used synthetic data generated from this model, I will reference this citation for both datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Jansen-Rit model as it is the basis for the synthetic datasets used in the study. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately documented and attributed.

After completing this process, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for further processing or review.
