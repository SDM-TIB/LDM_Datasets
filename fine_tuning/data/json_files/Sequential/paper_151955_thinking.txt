To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diverse and Accurate Image Description Using a Variational Auto-Encoder with an Additive Gaussian Encoding Space" by Liwei Wang, Alexander G. Schwing, and Svetlana Lazebnik, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of conditional variational auto-encoders (CVAEs) for image caption generation, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention that they conducted experiments on the **MSCOCO dataset**. This is a well-known dataset in the field of image captioning, and it is crucial to note its details.

In **section 4.1**, the authors provide specifics about the MSCOCO dataset, stating that it contains 82,783 training images and 40,504 validation images, each with five reference captions. This detailed description confirms that the MSCOCO dataset is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the MSCOCO dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

> X. Chen, H. Fang, T.-Y. Lin, R. Vedantam, S. Gupta, P. Doll√°r, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO Captions: Data Collection and Evaluation Server*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.00325, 2015.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction process:

1. **Identify sections**: Focus on the abstract, introduction, and experiments sections for dataset mentions.
2. **Locate dataset details**: Find specific sections that describe datasets used in experiments.
3. **Extract dataset information**: Note the dataset name, description, and any relevant statistics.
4. **Find full citations**: Refer to the references section for complete citations of the datasets.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing.
