To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Intrinsic Sparse Structures within Long Short-Term Memory" by Wei Wen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the method is evaluated on the **Penn TreeBank dataset** for language modeling and the **SQuAD dataset** for machine question answering. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4, the authors explicitly state that they evaluated their method using the **Penn TreeBank dataset** and the **SQuAD dataset**. I will note down the relevant details about each dataset as they are described in the paper.

1. **Penn TreeBank Dataset**: This dataset is used for language modeling. The authors reference the original work by Marcus et al. (1993) for this dataset. I will ensure to include this citation in my final output.

2. **SQuAD Dataset**: This dataset is used for machine question answering and is referenced as being crowdsourced from over 100,000 question-answer pairs on 500+ Wikipedia articles. The authors cite Rajpurkar et al. (2016) for this dataset, which I will also include in my final output.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Penn TreeBank dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marcus, M. P., Marcinkiewicz, M. A., & Santorini, B. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313-330.

- For the **SQuAD dataset**, the citation is:
  > Rajpurkar, P., Zhang, J., Lopyrev, K., & Liang, P. (2016). SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.05250*.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper along with their proper citations.
