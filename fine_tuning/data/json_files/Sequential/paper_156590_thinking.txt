To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SCaLAR NITK at SemEval-2024 Task 5: Towards Unsupervised Question Answering system with Multi-level Summarization for Legal Text" by M Manvith Prabhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the task and methods but does not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction discusses the complexity of legal texts and the objectives of the SemEval-2024 Task 5, which suggests that a dataset is involved but does not name it yet.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Background)**, where the authors describe the dataset provided by the organizers. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of three sets: Train Set, Dev Set, and Test Set, containing 666, 84, and 98 data points, respectively. This section provides a clear indication of the dataset structure and its contents.

In this section, the authors also describe the fields included in the dataset entries, such as Question, Answer, Explanation, Label, Analysis, and Complete-Analysis. This detailed description helps in understanding the dataset's purpose and how it is structured.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as being provided by the organizers of SemEval-2024 Task 5, but they do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is associated with the SemEval-2024 Task 5.

The citation for the task is:
> Leonard Bongard, Lena Held, and Ivan Habernal. *The legal argument reasoning task in civil procedure*. In Proceedings of the Natural Legal Language Processing Workshop 2022, pages 194–207, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (Hybrid). Association for Computational Linguistics.

Since the dataset is part of this task, I will use this citation to represent the dataset.

Now, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: SemEval-2024 Task 5 Dataset
   - **Description**: The dataset consists of three sets: Train Set (666 data points), Dev Set (84 data points), and Test Set (98 data points). Each entry includes fields such as Question, Answer, Explanation, Label, Analysis, and Complete-Analysis.
   - **Citation**: Leonard Bongard, Lena Held, and Ivan Habernal. *The legal argument reasoning task in civil procedure*. In Proceedings of the Natural Legal Language Processing Workshop 2022, pages 194–207, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (Hybrid). Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing.
