To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Do Neural Dialog Systems Use the Conversation History Effectively? An Empirical Study" by Chinnadhurai Sankar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **four multi-turn dialog datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **bAbI dialog**: A synthetic goal-oriented multi-turn dataset consisting of 5 different tasks for restaurant booking, specifically Task 5, which contains 1,000 dialogs with an average of 13 user utterances per dialog.

2. **Persona Chat**: An open-domain dataset with multi-turn chit-chat conversations, comprising 10,900 dialogs with an average of 14.8 turns per dialog.

3. **Dailydialog**: An open-domain dataset that resembles day-to-day conversations across multiple topics, containing 13,000 dialogs with an average of 7.9 turns per dialog.

4. **MutualFriends**: A multi-turn goal-oriented dataset where two agents must discover which friend of theirs is mutual based on the friendsâ€™ attributes, containing 11,000 dialogs with an average of 11.41 utterances per dialog.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **bAbI dialog**, the citation is:
  > Antoine Bordes and Jason Weston. *Learning end-to-end goal-oriented dialog*. CoRR, abs/1605.07683, 2016.

- For **Persona Chat**, the citation is:
  > Saizheng Zhang, Emily Dinan, Jack Urbanek, Arthur Szlam, Douwe Kiela, and Jason Weston. *Personalizing dialogue agents: I have a dog, do you have pets too?* arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.07243, 2018.

- For **Dailydialog**, the citation is:
  > Yanran Li, Hui Su, Xiaoyu Shen, Wenjie Li, Ziqiang Cao, and Shuzi Niu. *Dailydialog: A manually labelled multi-turn dialogue dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.03957, 2017.

- For **MutualFriends**, the citation is:
  > H. He, A. Balakrishnan, M. Eric, and P. Liang. *Learning Symmetric Collaborative Dialogue Agents with Dynamic Knowledge Graph Embeddings*. arXiv e-prints, 2017.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
