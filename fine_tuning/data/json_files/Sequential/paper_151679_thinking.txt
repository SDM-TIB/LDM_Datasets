To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporal Stability in Predictive Process Monitoring" by Irene Teinemaa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, while the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were used in the experiments.

In **subsection 4.2 (Datasets)**, the authors describe several datasets used in their experiments. I will extract the following datasets:

1. **BPIC2012**: This dataset contains the execution history of a loan application process in a Dutch financial institution. The authors define three separate binary classification tasks based on the final outcome of a case: accepted, declined, and cancelled.

2. **BPIC2017**: Similar to BPIC2012, this dataset also records execution traces of a loan application process but with improved data collection. It includes three binary classification tasks: accepted, refused, and cancelled.

3. **Sepsis Cases**: This dataset logs trajectories of patients with sepsis symptoms in a Dutch hospital. The authors created three different labelings based on patient outcomes.

4. **Hospital Billing**: This dataset comes from an ERP system of a hospital, focusing on billing procedures. The labeling is based on whether the case is reopened.

5. **Road Traffic Fines**: This dataset contains events related to traffic fines issued by an Italian local police force. The authors created a labeling based on whether the fine is repaid in full or sent for credit collection.

6. **Production Log**: This dataset records information about a manufacturing process, with labeling based on the number of rejected work orders.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **BPIC2012**: 
  > van der Aalst, W. M. (2016). *Process mining: data science in action*. Springer.

- **BPIC2017**: 
  > van der Aalst, W. M. (2016). *Process mining: data science in action*. Springer.

- **Sepsis Cases**: 
  > van der Aalst, W. M. (2016). *Process mining: data science in action*. Springer.

- **Hospital Billing**: 
  > van der Aalst, W. M. (2016). *Process mining: data science in action*. Springer.

- **Road Traffic Fines**: 
  > van der Aalst, W. M. (2016). *Process mining: data science in action*. Springer.

- **Production Log**: 
  > van der Aalst, W. M. (2016). *Process mining: data science in action*. Springer.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that all information is accurately represented for future reference or processing.
