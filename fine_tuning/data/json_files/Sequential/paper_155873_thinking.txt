To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LiteLSTM Architecture Based on Weights Sharing for Recurrent Neural Networks" by Nelly Elsayed et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed LiteLSTM model was evaluated on three different datasets from various domains, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Empirical Evaluation and Analysis)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits, split into 60,000 training samples and 10,000 testing samples. The authors provide a brief description of how the images are processed for their experiments.

2. **IEEE IoT Network Intrusion Dataset**: This dataset includes 42 raw network packet files generated from IoT devices, containing normal traffic and various types of cyberattacks. The authors describe how they used this dataset for binary classification and multi-class classification tasks.

3. **Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS)**: This dataset consists of 2,800 audio stimuli across seven different emotion categories. The authors mention its significance in emotion recognition tasks.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ (1998).

- For the **IEEE IoT Network Intrusion Dataset**, the citation is:
  > H. Kang, D.H. Ahn, G.M. Lee, J.D. Yoo, K.H. Park, H.K. Kim. *IoT Network Intrusion Dataset*. https://doi.org/10.21227/q70p-q449. https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/q70p-q449.

- For the **Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS)**, the citation is:
  > K. Dupuis, M.K. Pichora-Fuller. *Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS) - Younger Talker Happy* (2010).

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
