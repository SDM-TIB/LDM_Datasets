To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LVOS: A Benchmark for Long-term Video Object Segmentation" by Lingyi Hong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the LVOS dataset, stating that it consists of 220 videos with a total duration of 421 minutes, which indicates that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of other datasets in the **related work section**. The authors reference several existing video object segmentation datasets, including:

1. **FBMS**: Mentioned as a short-term video dataset with 59 sequences.
2. **DAVIS**: A popular benchmark dataset with 60 videos for training and validation.
3. **YouTube-VOS**: A large-scale dataset with 3,252 sequences.
4. **LaSOT**: A large-scale long-term tracking dataset with 1,400 videos.
5. **VOT-LT**: Another long-term tracking dataset.

In the **experiments section**, the authors compare their LVOS dataset with these existing datasets, confirming their relevance and providing context for the LVOS dataset's contributions.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **References section**:

- For **FBMS**, the citation is:

- For **YouTube-VOS**, the citation is:

- For **LaSOT**, the citation is:

- For **VOT-LT**, the citation is:

After compiling this information, I will ensure that I format the dataset entries correctly, including the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, which is essential for any further analysis or application of the research findings.
