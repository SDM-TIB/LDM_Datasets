To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Architecture Search on Acoustic Scene Classification" by Jixiang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention achieving a state-of-the-art performance on the **DCASE 2018 task 5 evaluation set**, which indicates that this dataset is likely central to their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** section, particularly in **section 3.1 (Dataset and Data Augmentation)**. Here, the authors describe the **DCASE 2018 Challenge task 5 dataset**, which contains audio segments of various domestic activities. They specify that the dataset is divided into a development set with 72,984 segments and an evaluation set with 72,972 segments, each containing four acoustic channels. This detailed description confirms the dataset's relevance to their research.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the DCASE 2018 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **DCASE 2018 Challenge - Task 5**: 
  > G. Dekkers, L. Vuegen, T. van Waterschoot, B. Vanrumste, and P. Karsmakers. *Monitoring of domestic activities based on multi-channel acoustics*. KU Leuven, Tech. Rep., 2018. [Online]. Available: https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11246

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **DCASE 2018 Task 5 Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed models in the paper. It consists of audio segments representing nine domestic activities, divided into development and evaluation sets.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset.
