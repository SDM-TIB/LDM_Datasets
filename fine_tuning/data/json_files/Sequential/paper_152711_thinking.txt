To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning On-Road Visual Control for Self-Driving Vehicles with Auxiliary Tasks" by Yilun Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors discuss their method's performance on the **Comma.ai dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiment Setup)**, where the authors describe their experimental environment. They mention using the **Comma.ai dataset**, which contains 7.5 hours of highway driving data, including images and corresponding control commands. This section provides detailed information about the dataset, confirming its relevance to their experiments.

In addition, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors also refer to the **Udacity simulator** as a source of training data, where they collected images and control commands from simulated driving scenarios. This indicates that the Udacity simulator dataset is also important for their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Comma.ai dataset**, the citation is:
   > Comma.ai. *Comma.ai Dataset*. Available at: https://comma.ai/dataset (Accessed: [insert access date]).

2. For the **Udacity simulator**, the citation is:
   > Udacity. *Self-Driving Car Simulator*. Available at: https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim (Accessed: [insert access date]).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper attribution and further research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing.
