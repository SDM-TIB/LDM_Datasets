To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FaceXHuBERT: Text-less Speech-driven E(X)pressive 3D Facial Animation Synthesis Using Self-Supervised Speech Representation Learning" by Kazi Injamamul Haque and Zerrin Yumak, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the scarcity of publicly available expressive audio-3D facial animation datasets, indicating that datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they utilized the **BIWI dataset**, which is described as the only publicly available dataset with both emotion and identity labels. The authors provide details about the dataset, including the number of subjects, the number of sequences, and the nature of the data (synchronized audio-4D scan pairs).

In this section, they mention that the BIWI dataset contains 14 human subjects uttering 40 phonetically balanced English sentences, resulting in a total of 1088 audio-4D pairs after accounting for missing sequences. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, as it allows them to evaluate their proposed method effectively.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the BIWI dataset. The citation is as follows:
> G. Fanelli, J. Gall, H. Romsdorfer, T. Weise, and L. Van Gool. *A 3-D Audio-Visual Corpus of Affective Communication*. IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, 12(6):591â€“598, October 2010.

Since the authors also mention other datasets like **VOCASET** and **Multiface**, I will note that while these datasets allow for identity incorporation, they do not include emotion labels, making them less relevant for the authors' specific experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the BIWI dataset, as it is the primary dataset used in the research.

In summary, the key steps are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experimental setup section for detailed dataset descriptions.
3. Retrieve full citations from the references for any datasets mentioned.
4. Compile the dataset information clearly, emphasizing the importance of full citations.
