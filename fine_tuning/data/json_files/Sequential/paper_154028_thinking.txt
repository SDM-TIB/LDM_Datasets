To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KQA Pro: A Dataset with Explicit Compositional Programs for Complex Question Answering over Knowledge Base" by Shulin Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions the introduction of **KQA Pro**, a dataset for complex question answering, which indicates that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets, particularly the **Datasets** or **Methodology** sections. In this paper, the authors describe **KQA Pro** in detail, highlighting its features, such as the number of questions (~120K), the inclusion of diverse natural language questions, and the provision of corresponding KoPL programs and SPARQL queries.

In the **KQA Pro Construction** section, the authors explain how they constructed the dataset, including the extraction of a knowledge base from **FB15k-237** and its alignment with **Wikidata**. This indicates that both **FB15k-237** and **Wikidata** are relevant datasets used in the creation of **KQA Pro**.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **KQA Pro**: The dataset itself does not have a separate citation since it is introduced in this paper, but I will note it as:
   > Shulin Cao, Jiaxin Shi, Liangming Pan, Lunyiu Nie, Yutong Xiang, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li, Bin He, Hanwang Zhang. *KQA Pro: A Dataset with Explicit Compositional Programs for Complex Question Answering over Knowledge Base*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2021.

2. **FB15k-237**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Toutanova, K., Chen, D., & Yates, A. (2015). *FB15k-237: A High-Quality Dataset for Knowledge Base Completion*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1535-1540.

3. **Wikidata**: The citation for Wikidata is:
   > Vrandečić, D., & Krötzsch, M. (2014). *Wikidata: A free collaborative knowledge base*. Communications of the ACM, 57(10), 78-85.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that the datasets are well-documented and easily accessible for future reference or analysis.
