To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantized Approximately Orthogonal Recurrent Neural Networks" by Armand Foucault et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors discuss the empirical results of their proposed methods on "a variety of standard benchmarks." This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors detail the tasks they evaluated their methods on. They mention several tasks, which often correspond to specific datasets. I will carefully read through this section to identify any datasets explicitly mentioned.

Upon reviewing Section 5, I find that the authors conducted experiments on the following datasets:

1. **Penn TreeBank Dataset**: This dataset is used for character-level language modeling tasks. The authors mention it in Section 5.4, where they describe the dataset's structure and the task of predicting the next character based on preceding ones.

2. **MNIST Dataset**: The authors refer to the MNIST dataset in Section 5.3, specifically for the permuted pixel-by-pixel MNIST (pMNIST) task. They explain how the dataset is used in their experiments.

3. **Adding Task Dataset**: In Section 5.1, the authors describe a synthetic dataset used for the adding task, which consists of sequences of random scalars. While this is not a standard dataset, it is important to note its structure and purpose.

4. **Copy Task Dataset**: Similar to the adding task, the copy task described in Section 5.2 uses a synthetic dataset designed for testing long-term memory capabilities in RNNs.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets that are standard and have been previously published. 

For the **Penn TreeBank Dataset**, the citation is:
> Marcus, M. P., Santorini, B., & Marcinkiewicz, M. A. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313-330.

For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
> LeCun, Y., Cortes, C., & Burges, C. J. C. (1998). MNIST handwritten digit database. *AT&T Labs*.

The adding and copy tasks do not have formal citations as they are synthetic datasets created for the purpose of the experiments in this paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the standard datasets, and prepare them for structured output.
