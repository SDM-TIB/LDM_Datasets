To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Slim LSTM Networks: LSTM 6 and LSTM C6" by Atra Akandeh and Fathi M. Salem, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to two benchmark datasets: **IMDB** and **20 Newsgroup**. This indicates that these datasets are relevant to their research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experiments and Discussion)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In **subsection 4.1**, they describe the **IMDB dataset** as a binary sentiment classification dataset, which includes a dictionary size of 5000 and reviews that are truncated or padded to 500 words. This section confirms the dataset's purpose and structure.

In **subsection 4.2**, the authors discuss the **20 Newsgroups dataset**, which consists of 20 different newsgroups containing a total of 20,000 documents. This section also provides insights into how the dataset is utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

- For the **IMDB dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. LeCun, C. Cortes, and C. J. Burges. *MNIST Handwritten Digit Database*. AT&T Labs [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist, 2010.

- For the **20 Newsgroups dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ken Lang. *Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews*. In Proceedings of the 1995 International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 331â€“339, 1995.

Although the IMDB dataset is not explicitly cited in the references, it is widely recognized in the machine learning community, and the above citation for the MNIST dataset is included for context.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
