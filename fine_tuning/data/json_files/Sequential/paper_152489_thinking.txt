To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Full End-to-End Semantic Role Labeler, Syntax-agnostic Over Syntax-aware?" by Jiaxun Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract highlights that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on the **CoNLL-2008 and CoNLL-2009 benchmarks** for both English and Chinese. This indicates that these benchmarks are likely datasets used in the research.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Dataset and Training Detail)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they confirm that they evaluated their model on the **CoNLL-2009 datasets** for both English and Chinese, which are standard datasets for semantic role labeling tasks.

Now, I will look for the full citations of these datasets in the **References section** of the paper. The CoNLL-2009 dataset is referenced multiple times throughout the paper, and I will ensure to find the correct citation format.

The citation for the **CoNLL-2009 dataset** is:
> Mihai Surdeanu, Richard Johansson, Adam Meyers, Lluís Màrquez, and Joakim Nivre. *The CoNLL 2009 Shared Task: Syntactic and Semantic Dependencies in Multiple Languages*. In Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL 2009): Shared Task, pages 1–18, Boulder, Colorado, June 2009.

Additionally, the paper mentions the **CoNLL-2008 dataset** in the context of its performance comparison. I will also look for its citation.

The citation for the **CoNLL-2008 dataset** is:
> Mihai Surdeanu, Richard Johansson, Adam Meyers, Lluís Màrquez, and Joakim Nivre. *The CoNLL 2008 Shared Task: Joint Parsing of Syntactic and Semantic Dependencies*. In Proceedings of the Twelfth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL 2008): Shared Task, pages 159–177, Manchester, England, August 2008.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **CoNLL-2009 Dataset**:
   - Citation: Mihai Surdeanu, Richard Johansson, Adam Meyers, Lluís Màrquez, and Joakim Nivre. *The CoNLL 2009 Shared Task: Syntactic and Semantic Dependencies in Multiple Languages*. In Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL 2009): Shared Task, pages 1–18, Boulder, Colorado, June 2009.

2. **CoNLL-2008 Dataset**:
   - Citation: Mihai Surdeanu, Richard Johansson, Adam Meyers, Lluís Màrquez, and Joakim Nivre. *The CoNLL 2008 Shared Task: Joint Parsing of Syntactic and Semantic Dependencies*. In Proceedings of the Twelfth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL 2008): Shared Task, pages 159–177, Manchester, England, August 2008.

With this information, I am ready to proceed with any further processing or documentation as needed.
