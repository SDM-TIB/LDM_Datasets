To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Voice Transformer Network: Sequence-to-Sequence Voice Conversion Using Transformer with Text-to-Speech Pretraining" by Wen-Chin Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a novel voice conversion model and hints at the use of large-scale TTS corpora, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental settings section** (Section 5) where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention the **CMU ARCTIC database** and the **M-AILABS speech dataset**. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

1. **CMU ARCTIC database**: The authors state that this database contains parallel recordings of professional US English speakers sampled at 16 kHz. They specify that one female speaker (slt) was chosen as the target speaker, and two other speakers (bdl and clb) were chosen as sources. They used 932 utterances for training and 100 utterances each for validation and evaluation.

2. **M-AILABS speech dataset**: The authors mention that they selected a US female English speaker (judy bieber) from this dataset to train a single-speaker Transformer-TTS model. The training set contained 15,200 utterances, which amounted to roughly 32 hours of audio.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **CMU ARCTIC database**, the citation is:
  > Kominek, J., & Black, A. W. (2004). *The CMU ARCTIC speech databases*. In Fifth ISCA Workshop on Speech Synthesis.

- For the **M-AILABS speech dataset**, the citation is:
  > Munich Artificial Intelligence Laboratories GmbH. (2019). *M-AILABS speech dataset*. Available at: https://www.caito.de/2019/01/the-m-ailabs-speech-dataset/ (accessed 30 November 2019).

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately and comprehensively.
