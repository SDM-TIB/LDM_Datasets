To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating the Explainers: Black-Box Explainable Machine Learning for Student Success Prediction in MOOCs" by Vinitra Swamy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental analysis sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "five massive open online courses (MOOCs)," which suggests that there are datasets related to these courses.

Next, I will focus on the **section 3 (Experimental Analysis)**, specifically **subsection 3.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they describe the log data collected from five MOOCs offered by École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne between 2013 and 2015. They mention the total number of students and the filtering process for early-dropout students, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's characteristics.

The paper lists the following five MOOCs:

1. **Digital Signal Processing 1 (DSP 1)**: This course has 5,629 students and a passing rate of 26.8%.
2. **Digital Signal Processing 2 (DSP 2)**: This course has 4,012 students and a passing rate of 23.1%.
3. **Éléments de Géomatique**: This course has 452 students and a passing rate of 45.1%.
4. **Villes Africaines**: This course has 5,643 students and a passing rate of 9.9%.
5. **Comprendre les Microcontrôleurs Micro**: This course has 4,069 students and a passing rate of 5.1%.

In addition to the course names and student counts, I will also note the passing rates, as they provide context for the datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from the MOOCs themselves and not published as standalone datasets, I will cite the paper that describes the MOOCs:

- For the dataset related to the MOOCs, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
