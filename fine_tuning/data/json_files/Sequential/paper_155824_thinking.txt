To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparative Study of Sentiment Analysis for Multi-Sourced Social Media Platforms" by Keshav Kapur and Rajitha Harikrishnan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors used a "multi-source dataset from the comment section of various social networking sites like Twitter, Reddit, etc." This suggests that there is a dataset involved, but I need to gather more specific details.

Next, I will examine the **preprocessing section** where the authors describe how they extracted tweets and comments using Twitter and Reddit APIs (Tweepy and PRAW). This indicates that the dataset is composed of data sourced from these two platforms. The authors mention that the dataset contains **200,118 data points** divided into three sentiment categories (positive, neutral, negative), which is important information for describing the dataset.

I will also look for any specific names or identifiers for the dataset. While the authors do not provide a formal name for the dataset, they refer to it as a "multi-source dataset" from Twitter and Reddit. I will note this as the dataset's description.

Now, I will check the **references section** to see if there are any citations related to the datasets used. However, the references primarily focus on methodologies and previous works rather than specific datasets. Since the authors did not provide a formal citation for the dataset, I will summarize the information based on the context provided in the paper.

The dataset can be described as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: Multi-source Sentiment Analysis Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset containing 200,118 data points sourced from the comment sections of Twitter and Reddit, labeled with sentiments (positive, neutral, negative).
- **Source**: Extracted using Twitter API (Tweepy) and Reddit API (PRAW).

Since there are no formal citations for the dataset in the references, I will not include any citations for it. Instead, I will focus on accurately describing the dataset based on the information provided in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that captures all the relevant details for future reference or processing.
