To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Operator Guidance Informed by AI-Augmented Simulations" by Samuel J. Edwards and Michael D. Levine, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on a multi-fidelity, data-adaptive approach, but I need to look for specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for operational guidance in ship motion predictions and reference various methodologies, but they do not explicitly mention datasets. I will need to look deeper into the methodology section.

In **section 2 (Methodology)**, the authors describe the tools used for simulations: **SimpleCode** and **LAMP**. They mention that data for these tools were generated under common bimodal, bidirectional sea conditions in the North Atlantic. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific references to them.

Continuing to **section 2.3 (Experimental Set-up)**, the authors specify that the training data environmental conditions were based on the **100 most historically observed combinations of primary and secondary seas in the North Atlantic during December**. This is a significant dataset, but I need to find the source or citation for this data.

The authors mention that the historical records were sourced from **Wavewatch III hindcasts run by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)**. This gives me a clear reference point for the dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Wavewatch III hindcasts. The relevant citation is:

- **Wavewatch III**: 
  > Tolman, H. L. (2009). User manual and system documentation of WAVEWATCH III version 3.14. Tech. Note 276, NOAA/NWS/NCEP/MMAB, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Weather Service, Camp Springs, Maryland, USA.

Additionally, I will note that the authors also refer to the **International Tow Tank Conference (ITTC) spectra** for generating wave spectra, which is another dataset source. The citation for this is:

- **ITTC Spectra**: 
  > International Tow Tank Conference (ITTC). (2014). ITTC â€“ Recommended Procedures and Guidelines: Seakeeping Experiments, 27th International Tow Tank Conference, Copenhagen.

Now, I have identified two key datasets used in the study:

1. **Historical wave data from Wavewatch III**.
2. **ITTC spectra for wave generation**.

I will compile these findings into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation for proper referencing in any future work or analysis. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and can be easily accessed by others interested in this research.
