To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An AI-Driven Approach to Wind Turbine Bearing Fault Diagnosis from Acoustic Signals" by Zhao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment details** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the study involves audio data from five predefined fault types, which indicates that there is a dataset related to these audio signals.

Next, I will focus on the **experiment details** section, specifically looking for any explicit mentions of datasets. In this section, the authors describe the process of acquiring and framing raw audio signals for five different fault types. They mention that audio data was collected for 40 seconds for each fault type, resulting in a dataset comprising 400 time-series data sequences, each tagged with fault labels.

I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Wind Turbine Bearing Fault Dataset**: This dataset consists of audio recordings from wind turbine generators with five predefined fault types. The dataset includes 25 sets of original audio data, each segmented into 400 frames, resulting in a total of 8000 training samples, 1000 validation samples, and 1000 test samples.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific external citation for the dataset itself, as it appears to be a novel dataset created by the authors for this study. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is original to this research.

In summary, I will document the dataset as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Wind Turbine Bearing Fault Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset consisting of audio recordings from wind turbine generators with five predefined fault types, including 8000 training samples, 1000 validation samples, and 1000 test samples.
- **Citation**: Zhao Wang, Xiaomeng Li, Na Li, Longlong Shu. *An AI-Driven Approach to Wind Turbine Bearing Fault Diagnosis from Acoustic Signals*. [Journal/Conference Name], [Volume], [Pages], [Year]. (Note: Specific journal/conference details would need to be filled in based on publication information.)

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
