To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "Generating Descriptions for Sequential Images with Local-Object Attention and Global Semantic Context Modelling" by Jing Su et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on datasets published by Microsoft, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the part where the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention two datasets: **SIS (Sequence-in-Sequence)** and **DII (Descriptions of Images-in-Isolation)**. The authors provide some statistics about these datasets, such as the number of training and testing samples, which confirms their relevance.

I will also check the **dataset statistics table** (Table 1) for additional details about the datasets, including the number of training and testing samples and vocabulary sizes. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope and scale.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the datasets as being published by Microsoft, and I will need to ensure I have the correct citation format for these datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **SIS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ting-Hao Huang, Francis Ferraro, Nasrin Mostafazadeh, Ishan Misra, Aishwarya Agrawal, Jacob Devlin, Ross Girshick, Xiaodong He, Pushmeet Kohli, Dhruv Batra, et al. *Visual storytelling*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 1233–1239, 2016.

- For the **DII dataset**, the citation is the same as for the SIS dataset since both datasets are published by Microsoft and share a similar structure:
  > Ting-Hao Huang, Francis Ferraro, Nasrin Mostafazadeh, Ishan Misra, Aishwarya Agrawal, Jacob Devlin, Ross Girshick, Xiaodong He, Pushmeet Kohli, Dhruv Batra, et al. *Visual storytelling*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 1233–1239, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that I have captured all relevant details about each dataset, including their names, descriptions, and full citations.
