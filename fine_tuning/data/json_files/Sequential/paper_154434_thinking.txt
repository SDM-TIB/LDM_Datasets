To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatial-Temporal Fusion Graph Neural Networks for Traffic Flow Forecasting" by Mengzhang Li and Zhanxing Zhu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method is evaluated on several public traffic datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed included.

Next, I will focus on the **Datasets section** of the paper, which is explicitly labeled. Here, the authors provide a table (Table 1) that summarizes the datasets used in their experiments. The datasets listed are:

1. **PEMS03**: This dataset consists of 358 nodes, 547 edges, 26,208 time steps, and a missing ratio of 0.672%.
2. **PEMS04**: This dataset consists of 307 nodes, 340 edges, 16,992 time steps, and a missing ratio of 3.182%.
3. **PEMS07**: This dataset consists of 883 nodes, 866 edges, 28,224 time steps, and a missing ratio of 0.452%.
4. **PEMS08**: This dataset consists of 170 nodes, 295 edges, 17,856 time steps, and a missing ratio of 0.696%.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the datasets as being constructed from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) and cite the work by Song et al. (2020) as the source of these datasets.

The citation for the datasets is:
> Song, C., Lin, Y., Guo, S., & Wan, H. (2020). Spatial-Temporal Synchronous Graph Convolutional Networks: A New Framework for Spatial-Temporal Network Data Forecasting. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, volume 34, 914â€“921.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for each dataset as required. 

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation.
