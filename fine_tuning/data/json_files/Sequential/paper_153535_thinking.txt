To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ultrafast Photorealistic Style Transfer via Neural Architecture Search" by Jie An et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors often describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section is crucial as it usually contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics relevant to the study.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **MS COCO dataset** for training their model. They describe it as a widely used dataset for image recognition and segmentation tasks, which is relevant for their photorealistic style transfer experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MS COCO dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Doll√°r, P., and Zitnick, C. L. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

Additionally, I will look for any supplementary materials or appendices that might mention other datasets used in the study. However, based on the content provided, it appears that the MS COCO dataset is the primary dataset referenced.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MS COCO dataset as it is essential for proper attribution and further research.

In summary, the key steps I followed are:
1. Read through the abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections to identify datasets.
2. Confirm the dataset used (MS COCO) and its relevance to the study.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the References section.
4. Document the dataset information clearly for future reference.

This structured approach ensures that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
