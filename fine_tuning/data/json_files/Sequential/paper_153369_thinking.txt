To extract datasets from the research paper titled "READ, HIGHLIGHT AND SUMMARIZE: A HIERARCHICAL NEURAL SEMANTIC ENCODER-BASED APPROACH" by Rajeev Bhatt Ambati et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a "text summarization dataset consisting of documents that are 800 tokens in length," which indicates that a specific dataset is being referenced.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant mentions in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention using the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset** in section 4.1 (Datasets). This section provides details about the dataset, including the number of training, validation, and test pairs, as well as the average length of documents and summaries.

The authors describe the CNN/Daily Mail dataset as follows:
- It contains **286,817 training pairs**, **13,368 validation pairs**, and **11,487 test pairs**. The source documents in the training set average **766 words** and **29.74 sentences**, while the summaries average **53 words** and **3.72 sentences**.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. The citation is provided in the paper as follows:
> Ramesh Nallapati, Bowen Zhou, Cicero dos Santos, Çağlar Gulçehre, and Bing Xiang. *Abstractive text summarization using sequence-to-sequence RNNs and beyond*. In Proceedings of The 20th SIGNLL Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning, pp. 280–290, Berlin, Germany, August 2016. Association for Computational Linguistics. doi: 10.18653/v1/K16-1028. URL https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/K16-1028.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extraction process:

1. **Identify mentions of datasets** in the abstract and introduction.
2. **Locate the datasets section** or relevant mentions in the experiments section.
3. **Extract details** about the datasets, including their characteristics and usage.
4. **Find full citations** for each dataset in the references section.

In this case, the only dataset mentioned is the CNN/Daily Mail dataset, and I have gathered all necessary details and the citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing or review.
