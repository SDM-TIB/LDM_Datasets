To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contextualize Knowledge Bases with Transformer for End-to-end Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems" by Yanjie Gou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conduct experiments on two public multi-turn task-oriented dialogue datasets. This indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 3.1, the authors explicitly state that they use two public datasets: **SMD** and **Multi-WOZ 2.1**. I will take note of these names as they are critical for my extraction.

Now, I will gather more details about each dataset. The authors provide references for these datasets in the same section:

1. **SMD (Schema-Guided Dialogue)**: The citation provided is:
   > Mihail Eric, Lakshmi Krishnan, Francois Charette, and Christopher D. Manning. *Key-value retrieval networks for task-oriented dialogue*. In Proceedings of the Annual SIGdial Meeting on Discourse and Dialogue, pages 37–49, Saarbrücken, Germany, 2017.

2. **Multi-WOZ 2.1**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Paweł Budzianowski, Tsung-Hsien Wen, Bo-Hsiang Tseng, Iñigo Casanueva, Stefan Ultes, Osman Ramadan, and Milica Gašić. *MultiWOZ - a large-scale multi-domain Wizard-of-Oz dataset for task-oriented dialogue modelling*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 5016–5026, Brussels, Belgium, 2018.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have the correct formatting for each citation as it is crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names and full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately for future reference or analysis.
