To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combining Deep Learning and Qualitative Spatial Reasoning to Learn Complex Structures from Sparse Examples with Noise" by Nikhil Krishnaswamy et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data gathering sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a novel approach for learning spatial structures, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction provides context but does not name any datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **Data Gathering section**, which states that the authors used data from a study where users collaborated with a virtual avatar to build staircases. This section mentions that the data consists of log files recording user-avatar interactions, which is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

The paper also references the **VoxSim experimental environment** and the **VoxML platform**, which are crucial for understanding the context of the dataset. However, the specific dataset derived from the user interactions is not named in a conventional sense, but rather described in terms of its content and structure.

I will also look for any references to external datasets or tools that might be used in conjunction with the primary dataset. The paper mentions the **QSRLib** library, which is used for qualitative spatial reasoning, but it does not specify a separate dataset associated with it.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the dataset:

1. **User-Avatar Interaction Dataset**: This dataset consists of log files from user interactions with a virtual avatar, where users built 3-step, 6-block staircases. The dataset captures the qualitative relations between blocks and their placements.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets or tools mentioned. The paper cites several works, but the specific dataset from the user interactions does not have a formal citation since it appears to be original data collected by the authors.

For the **VoxSim** and **VoxML**, I will note the relevant citations:

- For **VoxSim**:
  > Krishnaswamy, N., and Pustejovsky, J. (2016). VoxSim: A visual platform for modeling motion language. In Proceedings of COLING 2016, the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers. ACL.

- For **QSRLib**:
  > Gatsoulis, Y., Alomari, M., Burbridge, C., Dondrup, C., Duckworth, P., Lightbody, P., Hogg, D., Cohn, A., et al. (2016). QSRLib: a software library for online acquisition of qualitative spatial relations from video.

Since the user-avatar interaction dataset does not have a formal citation, I will note it as an original dataset created by the authors.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

- **User-Avatar Interaction Dataset**: Original dataset capturing user interactions with a virtual avatar to build staircases.
- **VoxSim**: Krishnaswamy, N., and Pustejovsky, J. (2016). VoxSim: A visual platform for modeling motion language. In Proceedings of COLING 2016, the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers. ACL.
- **QSRLib**: Gatsoulis, Y., Alomari, M., Burbridge, C., Dondrup, C., Duckworth, P., Lightbody, P., Hogg, D., Cohn, A., et al. (2016). QSRLib: a software library for online acquisition of qualitative spatial relations from video.

With this information compiled, I am ready to format the dataset entries as needed for further processing.
