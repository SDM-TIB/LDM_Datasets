To extract datasets from the paper titled "The Slodderwetenschap (Sloppy Science) of Stochastic Parrots â€“ A Plea for Science to NOT take the Route Advocated by Gebru and Bender" by Michael Lissack, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and main body of the paper** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract primarily discusses the author's critique of the "Parrot Paper" and does not mention any datasets directly. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the main sections of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **sections that discuss empirical evidence or examples**. I will look for any references to datasets that may have been used to support the arguments made in the paper. However, upon reviewing the text, it appears that the paper is largely a position piece and does not present original research or empirical datasets. Instead, it critiques the methodology and ethical considerations surrounding the use of datasets in AI research, particularly in the context of the "Parrot Paper."

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets or provide details about specific datasets used in research, I will check the **References section** for any cited datasets or studies that may have utilized datasets. The references primarily cite other papers and articles, but they do not provide specific datasets.

After reviewing the references, I will note that the paper discusses the ethical implications of using large datasets in AI and machine learning but does not provide specific datasets or their citations. The references include works that may discuss datasets, but they do not serve as direct citations for datasets used in the author's arguments.

In conclusion, since the paper does not contain any explicit datasets or their citations, I will summarize my findings as follows:

1. The paper does not mention any specific datasets.
2. It critiques the ethical considerations of using datasets in AI research without providing empirical data.
3. The references do not include citations for datasets but rather discuss related literature.

Therefore, I will not be able to create dataset entries as there are no datasets to cite from this paper. My final output will reflect this lack of dataset information.
