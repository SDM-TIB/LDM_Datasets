To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Alignment Restricted Streaming Recurrent Neural Network Transducer" by Jay Mahadeokar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors compare their method on **LibriSpeech and in-house datasets**, which suggests that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe their experiments. In **section 4.1**, they detail the **LibriSpeech dataset**, stating it contains 970 hours of labeled speech. This dataset is crucial for their evaluation.

In **section 4.2**, the authors describe the **Voice Command dataset**, which combines in-house human transcribed data and production traffic data from smart speakers. This dataset is also significant for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **LibriSpeech dataset**, the citation is:
   > Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. *Librispeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206â€“5210, 2015.

2. For the **Voice Command dataset**, since it is an in-house dataset, it may not have a formal citation in the references. However, I will note that it consists of human transcribed data and production traffic data, as described in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **LibriSpeech**: A large corpus of labeled speech data used for training and evaluating ASR systems.
- **Voice Command**: An in-house dataset combining human transcriptions and production traffic data from smart speakers.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets where applicable.
