To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Part-of-Speech Tagger for Bodo Language using Deep Learning approach" by Dhrubajyoti Pathak et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the development of a language model for the Bodo language and mentions the use of a POS tagging model, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Bodo POS Tagger)**, where the authors discuss the annotated dataset used for training the POS tagging model. Here, they mention the **Bodo Monolingual Text Corpus**, which is tagged by language experts as part of the Indian Languages Corpora Initiative Phaseâ€“II (ILCI Phase-II). This dataset contains approximately 30,000 sentences and 240,000 tokens, making it a significant resource for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Bodo Monolingual Text Corpus. The citation is as follows:
> ILCI-II, J. 2020b. Bodo monolingual text corpus ilci-ii.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to a corpus acquired from the **Linguistic Data Consortium for Indian Languages (LDC-IL)**, which is used to train the BodoBERT model. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset in the text, so I will note that it is a raw corpus used for training.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Bodo Monolingual Text Corpus. 

The datasets identified are:
1. **Bodo Monolingual Text Corpus**: This dataset is crucial for training the POS tagging model and is manually annotated.
   - Citation: ILCI-II, J. 2020b. Bodo monolingual text corpus ilci-ii.

2. **Linguistic Data Consortium for Indian Languages (LDC-IL)**: This corpus is used for training the BodoBERT model, but no specific citation is provided in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
