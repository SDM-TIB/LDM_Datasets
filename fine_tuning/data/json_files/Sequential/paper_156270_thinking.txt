To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Attentive Time Warping" by Shinnosuke Matsuo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on various datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to extract.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of time series classification and mention applications that may involve specific datasets. However, I need to look for explicit mentions of datasets in the experimental sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using two datasets for qualitative evaluations: 

1. **Unipen Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed method's performance on online handwritten character recognition. It consists of several subsets, including Unipen 1a, 1b, and 1c, with specific details about the number of classes and samples.

2. **UCR Dataset**: The authors refer to the University of California Riverside Time Series Classification Archive, which contains 85 different univariate time series datasets. They specifically mention using 52 datasets that meet certain criteria for their experiments.

In **section 5 (Experiments in Plug-in Scenario)**, the authors mention using the **MCYT-100 dataset** for online signature verification, which is another dataset relevant to their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Unipen Dataset**, the citation is:
  > I. Guyon, L. Schomaker, R. Plamondon, M. Liberman, S. Janet. *UNIPEN project of on-line data exchange and recognizer benchmarks*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR), pages 29–33, 1994.

- For the **UCR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. Chen, E. Keogh, B. Hu, N. Begum, A. Bagnall, A. Mueen, G. Batista. *The UCR time series classification archive*. Available at: www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data/ (July 2015).

- For the **MCYT-100 dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Ortega-Garcia, et al. *MCYT baseline corpus: A bimodal biometric database*. In IEE Proceedings – Vision, Image and Signal Processing, 150(6):395–401, 2003.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or datasets mentioned in the paper.
