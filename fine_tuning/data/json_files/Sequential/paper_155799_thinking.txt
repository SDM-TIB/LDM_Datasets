To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AI Knows Which Words Will Appear in Next Year’s Korean CSAT" by Byunghyun Ban et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a "text-mining-based word class categorization method" and "K-CSAT exam PDF files," indicating that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Method section**, particularly the subsection titled "Data." Here, the authors describe their data acquisition process, stating that they obtained K-CSAT exam files from 2003 to 2022 and mock test files from 2004 to 2022. This section provides specific details about the datasets used in their analysis.

The authors mention:
1. **K-CSAT Exam Files**: These files are the primary dataset used for analysis and training the AI model. They include official exam questions from the K-CSAT from 2003 to 2022.
2. **Mock Test Files**: These files are used for optimization of the method but not for training the neural networks. They include mock tests provided by KICE from June 2004 to September 2022.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the datasets themselves (K-CSAT and mock tests) do not have formal citations like published papers. Instead, I will note that the K-CSAT exam files are available from the Korea Institute of Curriculum and Evaluation (KICE) and provide the relevant URL for accessing these files.

The citation for the K-CSAT dataset can be summarized as:
- **K-CSAT Exam Files**: Korea Institute of Curriculum & Evaluation. "대학수학능력시험 연도별 접수현황." Web Report. 16 Nov. 2022. Available at: https://www.kice.re.kr

For the mock test files, since they are also provided by KICE, I will use the same citation format:
- **Mock Test Files**: Korea Institute of Curriculum & Evaluation. "Mock Tests for K-CSAT." Available at: https://www.kice.re.kr

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or processing.
