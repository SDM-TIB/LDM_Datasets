To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Separable Convolutional LSTMs for Faster Video Segmentation" by Andreas Pfeuffer and Klaus Dietmayer, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments on different datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section V (Evaluation)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they refer to two datasets:

1. **Cityscapes Dataset**: This dataset consists of 5000 color images with fine-annotated semantic labels. It is noted that 2975 images are used for training and 500 for validation, with 19 out of 30 available classes used for evaluation.

2. **Virtual Kitti Dataset**: This is a synthetic dataset containing 50 video sequences in various weather conditions, totaling 21,260 images. The authors mention that the dataset is split into two subsets for training and testing.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Cityscapes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. CoRR, abs/1604.01685, 2016.

- For the **Virtual Kitti Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A Gaidon, Q Wang, Y Cabon, and E Vig. *Virtual worlds as proxy for multi-object tracking analysis*. In CVPR, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
