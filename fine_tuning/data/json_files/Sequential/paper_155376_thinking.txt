To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Solar Energetic Particles Using SDO/HMI Vector Magnetic Data Products and a Bidirectional LSTM Network" by Yasser Abduallah et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the study. The abstract mentions that the data samples are collected from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satelliteâ€™s X-ray flare catalogs and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). This indicates that there are specific datasets related to solar flares and magnetic data.

Next, I will focus on the **data section (Section 2)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they mention the use of the **Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP)** dataset, which is produced by the SDO/HMI team. They specify that the SHARP data includes 18 physical parameters collected at a cadence of 12 minutes, which are crucial for their analysis.

The authors also describe the construction of two databases for their prediction tasks:
1. **FC S database**: This database contains records of active regions (ARs) that produced M- or X-class flares associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and whether they resulted in solar energetic particle (SEP) events.
2. **F S database**: This database includes records of ARs that produced M- or X-class flares, regardless of whether they were associated with CMEs, and whether they resulted in SEP events.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they utilized these databases for their experiments, which reinforces the importance of these datasets in their study.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The SHARP dataset is cited as follows:
- Bobra, M. G., Sun, X., Hoeksema, J., et al. (2014). "The Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP)". *Solar Physics*, 289, 3549. doi: 10.1007/s11207-014-0529-3.

Additionally, the authors reference the X-ray flare catalogs provided by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and the Space Weather Database of Notifications, Knowledge, Information (DONKI), but these do not have specific citations in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper.
