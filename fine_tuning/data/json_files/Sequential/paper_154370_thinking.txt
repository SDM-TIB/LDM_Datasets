To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Energy Forecasting in Smart Grid Systems: Recent Advancements in Probabilistic Deep Learning" by Devinder Kaur et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a comparative case study using the **Victorian electricity consumption** and **American electric power (AEP)** datasets, indicating that these datasets are significant for the research.

Next, I will look into the **case study section (Section 9)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will find the following information:

1. **Victorian Electricity Consumption Dataset**: This dataset includes half-hourly energy consumption values from April 2012 to March 2014 for 25 Victorian houses. This dataset is crucial for analyzing energy consumption patterns.

2. **American Electric Power (AEP) Dataset**: This dataset consists of hourly energy consumption values from October 2004 to August 2018. It is used to evaluate the performance of various forecasting methods.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to obtain the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Victorian Electricity Consumption Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Victorian Government. *Victorian Electricity Consumption Benchmark*. Available from: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/electricity-consumption-benchmarks.

- For the **AEP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > American Electric Power. *AEP Hourly Energy Consumption Dataset*. Available from: https://www.kaggle.com/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
