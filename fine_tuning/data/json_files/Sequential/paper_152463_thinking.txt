To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MnasNet: Platform-Aware Neural Architecture Search for Mobile" by Mingxing Tan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of MnasNet on **ImageNet classification** and **COCO object detection**, which suggests that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using **ImageNet** and **COCO** for their evaluations. 

1. **ImageNet**: This dataset is widely recognized for image classification tasks. The authors report that their MnasNet model achieves a top-1 accuracy of 75.2% on this dataset with a latency of 78ms on a Pixel phone.

2. **COCO (Common Objects in Context)**: This dataset is used for object detection tasks. The authors mention that their MnasNet model, when used as a feature extractor in the SSD object detection framework, achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 23.0.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > O. Russakovsky, J. Deng, H. Su, J. Krause, S. Satheesh, S. Ma, Z. Huang, A. Karpathy, A. Khosla, M. Bernstein, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211–252, 2015.

- For **COCO**, the citation is:
  > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. ECCV, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
