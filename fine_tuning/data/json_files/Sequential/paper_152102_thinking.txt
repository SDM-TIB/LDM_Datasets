To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improved Variational Autoencoders for Text Modeling using Dilated Convolutions" by Zichao Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate perplexity gains on two datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their evaluations. In section 3.1, they state that they use two large-scale document classification datasets: **Yahoo Answer** and **Yelp15 review**. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets, including their purpose and any relevant statistics mentioned.

The authors provide the following information about the datasets:

1. **Yahoo Answer Dataset**: This dataset is used for topic classification and contains 100,000 documents sampled from the original dataset, which has millions of samples. It includes 10 topics such as Society & Culture, Science & Mathematics, etc.

2. **Yelp15 Dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment classification and also contains 100,000 documents sampled from the original dataset. It includes 5 levels of ratings, with higher ratings indicating better reviews.

In the **data statistics table (Table 1)**, the authors provide additional details about the number of classes, documents, average word count, and vocabulary size for both datasets. This information will be useful for a comprehensive description of each dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference previous works that describe these datasets:

- For the **Yahoo Answer Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tang, Duyu, Qin, Bing, and Liu, Ting. "Document modeling with gated recurrent neural network for sentiment classification." In EMNLP, pp. 1422–1432, 2015.

- For the **Yelp15 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, Xiang, Zhao, Junbo, and LeCun, Yann. "Character-level convolutional networks for text classification." In Advances in neural information processing systems, pp. 649–657, 2015.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are structured and ready for review or further processing.
