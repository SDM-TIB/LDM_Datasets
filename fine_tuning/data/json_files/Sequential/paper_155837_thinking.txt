To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ColoristaNet for Photorealistic Video Style Transfer" by Xiaowen Qiu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors trained their model using videos from HMDB and YouTube VOS, which indicates that these are the datasets used. The introduction may provide additional context or details about these datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors state that they used videos collected from HMDB (Kuehne et al., 2011) and YouTube VOS (Xu et al., 2018) as content inputs. This confirms the datasets used for training.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **HMDB**, the citation is:
   > Kuehne, H., Jhuang, H., Garrote, E., Poggio, T., & Serre, T. (2011). *HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 2556â€“2563.

2. For **YouTube VOS**, the citation is:
   > Xu, N., Yang, L., Fan, Y., Yue, D., Liang, Y., Yang, J., & Huang, T. (2018). *YouTube-VOS: A large-scale video object segmentation benchmark*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.03327.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
