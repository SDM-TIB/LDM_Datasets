To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-to-End Optical Character Recognition for Bengali Handwritten Words" by Farisa Benta Safir et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of the **BanglaWritting dataset**, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved. I will note this down as it is likely the primary dataset used in the experiments.

Next, I will look into **section IV (Experimental Analysis)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the **BanglaWritting dataset** contains single-page handwriting from 260 different people, with a total of 21,234 words, and that they used 16,975 words for their experiments. This section provides essential details about the dataset's composition and its application in their research.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **BanglaWritting dataset**. The citation provided in the references is:
> M.F. Mridha, Abu Quwsar Ohi, M. Ameer Ali, Mazedul Islam Emon, and Muhammad Mohsin Kabir. *Banglawriting: A multi-purpose offline Bangla handwriting dataset*. Data in Brief, 34:106633, 2021.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the **BanglaWritting dataset** is the only dataset used in this research.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation as required. This will ensure that the dataset extraction is thorough and accurate, ready for any further processing or review.
