To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Breaking the Silence: Detecting and Mitigating Gendered Abuse in Hindi, Tamil, and Indian English Online Spaces" by Advaitha Vetagiri et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in a shared task that provided datasets of annotated Twitter posts in English, Hindi, and Tamil. This suggests that there are specific datasets that I need to locate.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset creation process. They mention that they created a dataset for detecting gender-based cyber violence, which consists of posts in three languages: English, Hindi, and Tamil. The dataset includes:

1. **English Dataset**: Contains 7,638 annotated posts.
2. **Hindi Dataset**: Contains 7,714 annotated posts.
3. **Tamil Dataset**: Contains 7,914 annotated posts.

The authors also mention that the dataset was annotated by 18 activists and researchers, which adds credibility to the dataset's quality.

I will then check the **References section** for full citations related to the datasets. The authors cite the dataset as follows:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
