To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating Biomedical BERT Models for Vocabulary Alignment at Scale in the UMLS Metathesaurus" by Goonmeet Bajaj et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Dataset)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors mention that they thank Nguyen et al. for sharing the training data used in their work. They describe the dataset created using the 2020AA release of the UMLS Metathesaurus, which contains approximately 27.9 million synonymous pairs and 170 million negative samples. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's composition and purpose.

I will also look for any **tables or figures** that summarize the dataset statistics, such as Table 2, which outlines the number of positive and negative examples in the training and testing datasets. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's structure and usage.

After gathering the dataset details, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference Nguyen et al. multiple times, which indicates that their work is foundational to the dataset used in this study. The relevant citation is:

- For the UMLS Metathesaurus dataset, the citation is:
  > Nguyen, V., Yip, H. Y., & Bodenreider, O. (2021). Biomedical vocabulary alignment at scale in the UMLS Metathesaurus. In Proceedings of the Web Conference 2021, pages 2672â€“2683.

Now, I will compile the extracted dataset information, including the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that each entry is clearly articulated and properly referenced.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are structured and ready for any further processing or review.
