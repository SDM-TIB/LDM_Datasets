To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mutual Exclusivity Training and Primitive Augmentation to Induce Compositionality" by Yichen Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their methods on two widely-used compositionality datasets: **SCAN** and **COGS**. This suggests that these datasets are central to the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **background** and **methods** sections. In the background, the authors provide a brief description of both datasets:

1. **SCAN (Lake and Baroni, 2018)**: This dataset consists of natural language commands paired with action sequences, designed to test compositional generalization.

2. **COGS (Kim and Linzen, 2020)**: This dataset requires parsing a diverse set of natural language sentences into their corresponding logical forms based on lambda calculus, raising various systematic generalization challenges.

I will also check the **experiments** section to confirm that these datasets were indeed used for evaluation. The authors mention using SCAN and COGS in their experiments, which reinforces their importance in the study.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **references section** of the paper:

- For **SCAN**, the citation is:
  > Lake, B. M., & Baroni, M. (2018). Generalization without systematicity: On the compositional skills of sequence-to-sequence recurrent networks. In International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), pages 2873–2882.

- For **COGS**, the citation is:
  > Kim, N., & Linzen, T. (2020). COGS: A compositional generalization challenge based on semantic interpretation. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 9087–9105.

After compiling this information, I will create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
