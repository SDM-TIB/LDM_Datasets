To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Search to Distill: Pearls are Everywhere but not the Eyes" by Yu Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the Architecture-aware Knowledge Distillation (AKD) approach and its application to various tasks, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their structure or purpose.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using the **ImageNet dataset** for their experiments. This is a well-known dataset in the field of computer vision, primarily used for image classification tasks. They also reference the **MegaFace dataset** for face recognition tasks, which is significant for evaluating the performance of their models in a real-world scenario.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **ImageNet dataset**, the citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E. Hinton. *ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 1097–1105, 2012.

2. For the **MegaFace dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman, Steven M Seitz, Daniel Miller, and Evan Brossard. *The MegaFace Benchmark: 1 Million Faces for Recognition at Scale*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 4873–4882, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
