To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Time Series Modeling for Heart Rate Prediction: From ARIMA to Transformers" by Haowei Ni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the study investigates deep learning models for predicting heart rate time series from the **MIT-BIH Database**. This indicates that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will look into the **Methods section**, specifically **section A (Data Description and Preparation)**, where the authors describe the heart rate time series dataset obtained from the **MIT-BIH Database**. They detail that this dataset contains heart rate measurements for four individuals, with specific information about the number of readings and intervals. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use in the study.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **MIT-BIH Database**. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and will help in documenting the dataset accurately.

The citation for the **MIT-BIH Database** is:
> Moody, G. B., & Mark, R. G. (2001). *The MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database*. PhysioNet. Available at: https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/mitdb/

Since the paper primarily focuses on the heart rate data from this single dataset, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry based on the information gathered, ensuring that it is ready for review or further processing.
