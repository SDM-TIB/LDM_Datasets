To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Neural Architecture Search via Operator Clustering" by Li Guilin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet**, indicating that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they conduct experiments on **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, each containing 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. They also mention that **ImageNet** is used for a benchmark, specifically noting the architecture search is conducted on the full dataset without subsampling.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *Cifar-10 and cifar-100 datasets*. URL: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/kriz/cifar.html, 2009.

2. For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. In International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
