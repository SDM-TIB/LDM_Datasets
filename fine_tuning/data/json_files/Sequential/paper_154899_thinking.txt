To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ContextNet: A Click-Through Rate Prediction Framework Using Contextual Information to Refine Feature Embedding" by Zhiqiang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on four real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Experiment Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **Criteo Dataset**: A well-known public dataset for click-through rate prediction, containing 45 million instances with 39 fields and 30 million features.
2. **MovieLens Dataset**: Specifically, the MovieLens 1M dataset, which includes 1 million ratings from 6000 users on 4000 movies.
3. **Malware Dataset**: A dataset used for predicting the probability of a Windows machine getting infected, structured as a binary classification problem.
4. **Avazu Dataset**: This dataset consists of ad click-through data with 24 fields indicating elements of a single ad impression, totaling 40.43 million instances.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets directly, but I can infer the following based on common knowledge:

- For the **Criteo Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Criteo. "Criteo Labs: Download Terabyte Click Logs." Available at: http://labs.criteo.com/downloads/download-terabyte-click-logs/

- For the **MovieLens Dataset**, the citation is:
  > GroupLens Research. "MovieLens 1M Dataset." Available at: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/

- For the **Malware Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Microsoft. "Microsoft Malware Prediction Dataset." Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction

- For the **Avazu Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Avazu. "Avazu CTR Prediction Dataset." Available at: http://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
