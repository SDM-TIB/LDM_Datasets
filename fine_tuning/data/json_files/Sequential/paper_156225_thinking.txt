To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FUSION-GRU: A DEEP LEARNING MODEL FOR FUTURE BOUNDING BOX PREDICTION OF TRAFFIC AGENTS IN RISKY DRIVING VIDEOS" by Muhammad Monjurul Karim et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method is evaluated on two publicly available datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Implementation and Experimental Evaluation)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (The Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will find detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant annotations.

The paper mentions two datasets:

1. **Risky Object Localization (ROL)**: This dataset contains 1000 crash videos with diverse environmental attributes, each video being 5 seconds long and encoded at 20 frames per second with a resolution of 1080 × 720. It includes spatial, temporal, and categorical annotations.

2. **Honda Egocentric View-Intersection (HEV-I)**: This dataset consists of 230 egocentric dashcam videos recorded in urban driving scenarios, focusing on intersections. Each video ranges from 10 to 60 seconds in length, encoded at 10 frames per second, and has a resolution of 1280 × 640.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Risky Object Localization (ROL)** dataset, the citation is:
  > Muhammad Monjurul Karim, Zhaozheng Yin, and Ruwen Qin. *An attention-guided multistream feature fusion network for early localization of risky traffic agents in driving videos*. IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles, pages 1–12, 2023.

- For the **Honda Egocentric View-Intersection (HEV-I)** dataset, the citation is:
  > Yu Yao, Mingze Xu, Chiho Choi, David J Crandall, Ella M Atkins, and Behzad Dariush. *Egocentric vision-based future vehicle localization for intelligent driving assistance systems*. In 2019 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pages 9711–9717. IEEE, 2019.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
