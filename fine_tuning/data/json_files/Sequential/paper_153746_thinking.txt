To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Name Entity Recognition under Highly Unbalanced Data" by Thong Nguyen, Duy Nguyen, and Pramod Rao, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of Named Entity Recognition (NER) and mentions the use of a small dataset for training, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their methodology and the challenges they faced with unbalanced data, but they do not explicitly mention any specific datasets in the abstract or introduction.

I will then check the **results** and **discussion** sections for any references to datasets used for evaluation or training. The authors discuss the performance of their models and mention the use of a corpus annotated with 8 types of entities, but they do not provide a specific name for this dataset.

Since the paper does not explicitly name any datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to see if any cited works include datasets that might be relevant to the research. The references include various papers on NER and machine learning techniques, but I will need to determine if any of these papers describe datasets that were used in the experiments.

After reviewing the references, I find that the paper cites the following works that may contain relevant datasets:

1. **Glove Embedding Dataset**: 
   - Citation: Pennington, Jeffrey, Richard Socher, and Christopher D. Manning. "Glove: Global vectors for word representation." Proceedings of the 2014 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing (EMNLP). 2014.

2. **BERT Model**: 
   - Citation: Devlin, Jacob, et al. "Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding." arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.04805 (2018).

While these references do not provide a specific dataset name used in the experiments, they indicate the use of pre-trained embeddings that are crucial for the NER task.

Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset names or citations, I will summarize the findings as follows:

- The authors utilized a corpus annotated with 8 types of entities for their experiments, but the specific dataset name is not provided in the paper.
- They referenced the Glove and BERT models, which are associated with their respective datasets for embeddings.

In conclusion, I will note that while the paper discusses the use of datasets for training and evaluation, it lacks specific dataset names and citations. I will document this in my final output to ensure clarity on the limitations of the dataset information provided in the paper.
