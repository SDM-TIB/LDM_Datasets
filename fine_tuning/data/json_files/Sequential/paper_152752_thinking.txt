To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid NER System for Multi-Source Offer Feeds" by Anusha Holla et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but the **dataset section** is likely where detailed information about the datasets will be found.

In the **Introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of extracting entities from offers, which suggests that they have utilized specific datasets for their experiments. However, I need to look for explicit mentions of dataset names and their characteristics.

Next, I will focus on **Section III (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the datasets they collected by scraping offers from five different sources. They mention that four sources are banks and one is an offer-aggregator website. The datasets are labeled as D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5, with D5 being used for testing.

The details provided in **Table I** outline the datasets, including the source URLs, the number of offers scraped, and the number of templates made. Here are the datasets I will extract:

1. **D1 (Axis Bank)**: 
   - Source URL: https://www.axisbank.com/grab-deals/online-offers
   - Number of Offers Scraped: 91
   - Number of Templates Made: 35

2. **D2 (ICICI Bank)**: 
   - Source URL: https://www.icicibank.com/Personal-Banking/offers/offer-index.page
   - Number of Offers Scraped: 95
   - Number of Templates Made: 27

3. **D3 (HDFC Bank)**: 
   - Source URL: https://offers.smartbuy.hdfcbank.com/list_offer/credit_card/2
   - Number of Offers Scraped: 42
   - Number of Templates Made: 33

4. **D4 (Grabon)**: 
   - Source URL: https://www.grabon.in/paytm-coupons/
   - Number of Offers Scraped: 148
   - Number of Templates Made: 10

5. **D5 (SBI Bank)**: 
   - Source URL: https://www.sbicard.com/en/personal/offers.page
   - Number of Offers Scraped: 14
   - Number of Templates Made: 651

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to these datasets. However, since these datasets are derived from specific websites and not from traditional academic sources, I will note that the citations will primarily consist of the URLs provided in the dataset descriptions.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation (source URL) for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for any downstream processing or review.
