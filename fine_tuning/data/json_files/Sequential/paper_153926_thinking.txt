To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparison of Recurrent Neural Network Architectures for Wildfire Spread Modelling" by Rylan Perumal and Terence L van Zyl, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the research.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsection titled "Data Preparation." Here, the authors describe the use of an **active fire dataset from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)** for the years 2012â€“2014. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, as it contains data points relevant to wildfire modeling.

In this section, the authors detail how they extracted data points within a bounding box of South Africa, including variables such as latitude, longitude, time, date, and fire radiative power (FRP). This indicates that the dataset is well-defined and structured.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **results section** or throughout the paper. However, the primary dataset appears to be the one derived from the VIIRS data.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the VIIRS dataset. Since the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, I will reference the source of the data, which is the VIIRS.

The citation for the VIIRS dataset is:
> "Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Active Fire Data." National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Available at: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/viirs/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as required. The dataset entry will focus on the active fire dataset used for wildfire modeling, detailing its characteristics and relevance to the study.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary information is included and accurately represented.
