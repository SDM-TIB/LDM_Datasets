To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Forecasting, capturing and activation of carbon-dioxide (CO2): Integration of Time Series Analysis, Machine Learning, and Material Design" by Suchetana Sadhukhan and Vivek Kumar Yadav, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and materials and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study analyzes daily industry-specific, country-wise CO2 emissions from January 2019 to February 2023, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Materials and Methods)**, specifically **subsection 2.1 (Data Analysis)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the data is sourced from the **Carbon Monitor research initiative**, which provides near-real-time activity data for CO2 emissions across various sectors and countries.

The paper specifies that the analysis focuses on emissions from the **Power, Industry, Ground Transport, Domestic Aviation, and International Aviation sectors** in European countries (EU27 & UK, Italy, Germany, Spain) and India. This indicates that the dataset is comprehensive and covers multiple countries and sectors.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Carbon Monitor dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **Carbon Monitor dataset**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Z.; Ciais, P.; Deng, Z.; Davis, S. J.; Zheng, B.; Wang, Y.; Cui, D.; Zhu, B.; Dou, X.; Ke, P., et al. *Carbon Monitor, a near-real-time daily dataset of global CO2 emission from fossil fuel and cement production*. Scientific data 2020, 7, 392.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Carbon Monitor Dataset**: This dataset includes daily industry-specific, country-wise CO2 emissions data from January 2019 to February 2023, focusing on various sectors across multiple countries.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included for proper referencing.
