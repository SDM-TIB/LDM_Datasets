To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Guider l’attention dans les modèles de séquence à séquence pour la prédiction des actes de dialogue" by Emile Chapuis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the importance of dialogue act prediction and hints at the use of specific datasets for evaluation. This suggests that datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Protocole Expérimental)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they refer to two classic datasets for dialogue act classification:

1. **Switchboard Dialogue Act Corpus (SwDA)**: This dataset consists of approximately 2,400 telephone conversations between 543 speakers, covering around 70 topics. It includes 42 different dialogue acts and is crucial for understanding the global dependencies in dialogue.

2. **Meeting Recorder Dialogue Act (MRDA)**: This dataset contains 72 hours of multi-party meetings, annotated with dialogue acts. The authors specify that they use 5 dialogue acts for their experiments, including statements, questions, and backchannels.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of these datasets:

- For the **Switchboard Dialogue Act Corpus (SwDA)**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Stolcke, Elizabeth Shriberg, Rebecca Bates, Noah Coccaro, Daniel Jurafsky, Rachel Martin, Marie Meteer, Klaus Ries, Paul Taylor, Carol Van Ess-Dykema, et al. *Dialogue act modeling for automatic tagging and recognition of conversational speech*. Computational Linguistics 26, 3 (2000), 339–373.

- For the **Meeting Recorder Dialogue Act (MRDA)**, the citation is:
  > Elizabeth Shriberg, Raj Dhillon, Sonali Bhagat, Jeremy Ang, and Hannah Carvey. *The ICSI meeting recorder dialog act (MRDA) corpus*. In Proceedings of the 5th SIGdial Workshop on Discourse and Dialogue at HLT-NAACL 2004.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
