To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Ternary Bi-Directional LSTM Classification for Brain Activation Pattern Recognition Using fNIRS" by Sajila D. Wickramaratne and MD Shaad Mahmud, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves classifying brain activation patterns using fNIRS data, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the **Data subsection**. Here, the authors describe the data obtained from a study conducted by Shin et al. This is a crucial point as it indicates that the dataset is derived from another research work.

In the **Data subsection**, the authors provide specific details about the dataset:
- The dataset consists of subjects performing three tasks: mental arithmetic (MA), motor imagery (MI), and idle state (IS).
- It includes data from 18 subjects (10 men and 8 women) with an average age of 23.8 years.
- The data was collected using a portable NIRS system at a sampling rate of 13.3 Hz with 16 channels.

The authors also mention that each subject performed 90 tasks corresponding to the three activities, which were chosen randomly. This detailed description confirms the existence of a structured dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset used in this study. The authors refer to the original study by Shin et al. for the dataset, which is crucial for proper citation.

The citation for the dataset is:
> J. Shin, J. Kwon, and C.-H. Im. *A ternary hybrid EEG-NIRS brain-computer interface for the classification of brain activation patterns during mental arithmetic, motor imagery, and idle state*. Frontiers in Neuroinformatics, vol. 12, p. 5, 2018.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:
1. **Dataset Name**: fNIRS Data for Brain Activation Pattern Recognition
   - **Description**: The dataset consists of fNIRS data collected from 18 subjects performing three tasks: mental arithmetic, motor imagery, and idle state. Each subject performed 90 tasks in random order.
   - **Citation**: J. Shin, J. Kwon, and C.-H. Im. *A ternary hybrid EEG-NIRS brain-computer interface for the classification of brain activation patterns during mental arithmetic, motor imagery, and idle state*. Frontiers in Neuroinformatics, vol. 12, p. 5, 2018.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
