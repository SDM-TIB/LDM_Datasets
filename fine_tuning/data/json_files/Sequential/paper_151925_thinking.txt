To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discovery of Shifting Patterns in Sequence Classification" by Xiaowei Jia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on two real-world applications: **cropland mapping** and **affective state recognition**. This suggests that datasets related to these applications may be included.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their evaluation on two datasets:

1. **MODIS Multi-Spectral Data**: This dataset is used for the cropland mapping task. The authors mention that it includes reflectance values for multiple spectral bands collected over time for various locations in Minnesota. They specify that they took 5,000 locations for corn and soybean classes in 2014 and 2016, with ground-truth information provided by the USDA crop layer product.

2. **DEAP EEG Dataset**: This dataset is used for the affective state recognition task. The authors describe it as containing 40-channel EEG data recorded from 32 participants while they watched videos. The goal is to classify whether a participant liked a video based on the EEG recordings.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MODIS Multi-Spectral Data**, the citation is:
  > USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service. *CropScape: Cropland Data Layer*. Available at: https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/. Accessed: 2017-09-25.

- For the **DEAP EEG Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Koelstra, S., Muhl, C., Soleymani, M., Lee, J.-S., Yazdani, A., Ebrahimi, T., Pun, T., Nijholt, A., and Patras, I. *DEAP: A Database for Emotion Analysis Using Physiological Signals*. IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, 2012.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary details for future reference or processing. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and thoroughness in the dataset extraction process.
