To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep neural network-based classification model for Sentiment Analysis" by Donghang Pan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on a "public dataset," which indicates that there is at least one dataset used in their research. I will look for specific names or descriptions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), particularly the **dataset description** subsection. Here, the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used for their experiments. They mention the "Evaluation of Chinese Implicit Sentiment Analysis (SMPECISA)" dataset, which is crucial for my extraction.

In the dataset description, the authors explain that the dataset includes microblogs, travel websites, and product forums, with sentiment labels categorized into positive, negative, and neutral. They also provide statistics about the dataset, such as the number of training and test samples for each sentiment category.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the SMPECISA dataset. Since the dataset is mentioned as part of their experimental setup, I will check if the authors provide a specific reference for it. If not, I will note that the dataset is not formally cited in the references.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that I follow the required format for clarity and completeness.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for any further processing or review.
