To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Word separation in continuous sign language using isolated signs and post-processing" by Razieh Rastgoo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used two public datasets for evaluation: **RKS-PERSIANSIGN** and **ASLLVD**. This is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on the **datasets section (4.1)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **RKS-PERSIANSIGN**: This dataset consists of 10,000 RGB videos of 100 Persian signs, recorded by 10 contributors. Each sign has 100 video samples, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's scale and purpose.

2. **ASLLVD**: This dataset contains American sign words with corresponding annotations. The authors selected 100 sign categories, each with at least seven video samples. This dataset is also essential for their evaluation.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **RKS-PERSIANSIGN**, the citation is:
  > Rastgoo, R., Kiani, K., and Escalera, S. (2020a). Hand sign language recognition using multi-view hand skeleton. *Expert Systems with Applications*, 150. doi: 10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113336.

- For **ASLLVD**, the citation is:
  > Neidle, C., Thangali, A., and Sclaroff, S. (2012). Challenges in Development of the American Sign Language Lexicon Video Dataset (ASLLVD) Corpus. *Proc. of 5th Workshop on the Representation and Processing of Sign Languages: Interactions between Corpus and Lexicon*, LREC 2012, pp. 1â€“8.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for any further processing or analysis.
