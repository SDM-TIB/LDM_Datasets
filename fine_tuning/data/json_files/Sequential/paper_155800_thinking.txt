To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sentence-Level Sign Language Recognition Framework" by Atra Akandeh, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed models on the **RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather** dataset, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **dataset section** (section 3). Here, the authors provide a comprehensive description of the **RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather** dataset, stating that it contains 5,672 sentences in German sign language, 65,227 signs, and a total of 799,006 frames. This section also includes statistics about the training, development, and test splits, which are important for understanding the dataset's structure.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> J. Forster, C. Schmidt, T. Hoyoux, O. Koller, U. Zelle, J. Piater, and H. Ney. *RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather: A large vocabulary sign language recognition and translation corpus*. In Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC-2012), pages 3785â€“3789, 2012.

Since the paper primarily focuses on this dataset, I will ensure to include all relevant details about it in my final output.

Now, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that the dataset is properly documented and can be referenced accurately in future work.
