To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Am I a Baller? Basketball Performance Assessment from First-Person Videos" by Gedas Bertasius et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about any datasets referenced. The abstract mentions a "10.3 hour long first-person basketball dataset," which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (First-Person Basketball Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they created. Here, they describe the dataset as consisting of 10.3 hours of videos featuring 48 college players, recorded using a GoPro camera. They also mention the specifics of the data collection process, including the number of videos, their duration, and the frame extraction process.

In this section, I will note the following key details about the dataset:

1. **First-Person Basketball Dataset**: This dataset includes 10.3 hours of first-person video footage of 48 college basketball players. The videos were recorded at a resolution of 1280x960 at 100 fps, with a total of 500 labeled pairs used for performance assessment.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for this dataset. However, since this dataset is created by the authors of the paper, it may not have a separate citation in the references. Instead, I will document the dataset as follows:

- **First-Person Basketball Dataset**: 
  > Gedas Bertasius, Hyun Soo Park, Stella X. Yu, and Jianbo Shi. *Am I a Baller? Basketball Performance Assessment from First-Person Videos*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023.

Since the dataset is original and created for the purposes of this study, the citation will reference the paper itself.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their citations as required.
