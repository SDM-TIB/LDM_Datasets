To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Seq2Mol: Automatic design of de novo molecules conditioned by the target protein sequences through deep neural networks" by Ahmadreza Ghanbarpour and Markus A. Lill, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a dataset from BindingDB for training and validation, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, specifically the **Datasets subsection**. Here, the authors describe the dataset they used, which originates from BindingDB. They mention that the dataset was reduced to protein-ligand pairs with IC50 values of less than 1 mM and that the data was taken from the "BindingDBAll2018m8.tsv.zip" file. This gives me the first dataset to document.

The authors also specify that they used the dataset from the work by Karimi et al., which is another important reference for the dataset. I will need to ensure I capture this citation as well.

In the **References section**, I will look for the full citations for both the BindingDB dataset and the dataset from Karimi et al. The citation for BindingDB is:

- Liu, T.; Lin, Y.; Wen, X.; Jorissen, R. N.; Gilson, M. K. *BindingDB: a web-accessible database of experimentally determined protein-ligand binding affinities*. Nucleic acids research 2007, 35, D198–D201.

For the dataset from Karimi et al., the citation is:

- Karimi, M.; Wu, D.; Wang, Z.; Shen, Y. *DeepAffinity: interpretable deep learning of compound–protein affinity through unified recurrent and convolutional neural networks*. Bioinformatics 2019, 35, 3329–3338.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets, including their descriptions and full citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the documentation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined with its respective citation, ready for further processing or review.
