To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cells in Multidimensional Recurrent Neural Networks" by Gundram Leifert et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. In the abstract, the authors refer to experiments conducted on the **IFN/ENIT** and **Rimes** databases, indicating that these are the datasets used for their evaluations.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 8) where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention the two datasets:

1. **IFN/ENIT Database**: This dataset contains handwritten names of towns and villages in Tunisia, divided into training and validation sets. The authors provide details about the number of samples used for training and validation.

2. **Rimes Database**: This dataset is used for handwritten word recognition and consists of a large number of images of French single words, also divided into training, validation, and test sets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **IFN/ENIT Database**, the citation is:
  > Pechwitz, M., Maddouri, S., Märgner, V., Ellouze, N., Amiri, H., et al. *IFN/ENIT-database of handwritten Arabic words*. In Proceedings of CIFED, volume 2, pages 127–136. Citeseer, 2002.

- For the **Rimes Database**, the citation is:
  > Augustin, E., Brodin, J.-M., Carré, M., Geoffrois, E., Grosicki, E., and Prêteux, F. *RIMES evaluation campaign for handwritten mail processing*. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition, 2006.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
