To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OTSeq2Set: An Optimal Transport Enhanced Sequence-to-Set Model for Extreme Multi-label Text Classification" by Jie Cao and Yin Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on four benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **Eurlex-4K**: This dataset is referenced as a benchmark for legal text classification, containing 3,865 labels and 186,104 training samples.

2. **Wiki10-31K**: This dataset is mentioned as a large-scale dataset with 31,000 labels, used for multi-label classification tasks.

3. **AmazonCat-13K**: This dataset is noted for its application in product categorization, containing 13,000 labels.

4. **Amazon-670K**: This is described as an extreme-scale dataset with 670,000 labels, used for multi-label classification.

I will then verify the details of these datasets in the **dataset statistics table** (Table 1) to ensure accuracy regarding the number of labels and samples.

After confirming the dataset names and their descriptions, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will typically include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations:

- **Eurlex-4K**: 
  > Eneldo Loza Mencía and Johannes Fürnkranz. *Efficient pairwise multilabel classification for large-scale problems in the legal domain*. In Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases, pages 50–65, 2008.

- **Wiki10-31K**: 
  > Arkaitz Zubiaga. *Enhancing navigation on Wikipedia with social tags*. arXiv:1202.5469, 2012.

- **AmazonCat-13K**: 
  > Julian McAuley and Jure Leskovec. *Hidden factors and hidden topics: understanding rating dimensions with review text*. In Proceedings of the 7th ACM conference on Recommender systems, pages 165–172, 2013.

- **Amazon-670K**: 
  > Julian McAuley and Jure Leskovec. *Hidden factors and hidden topics: understanding rating dimensions with review text*. In Proceedings of the 7th ACM conference on Recommender systems, pages 165–172, 2013.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing.
