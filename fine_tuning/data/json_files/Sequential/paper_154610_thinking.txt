To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluation of deep learning models for multi-step ahead time series prediction" by Rohitash Chandra et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results section** (Section IV), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in Section IV. Specifically, they refer to:

1. **Mackey-Glass Dataset**: This dataset is used for chaotic time series prediction and is a well-known benchmark in the field.
2. **Lorenz Dataset**: Another chaotic time series dataset that is commonly used for testing prediction models.
3. **Henon Dataset**: This dataset is also used for chaotic time series prediction.
4. **Rossler Dataset**: Similar to the others, this dataset is used for evaluating prediction models on chaotic time series.
5. **Sunspot Dataset**: This dataset contains historical sunspot activity data and is used for time series forecasting.
6. **Lazer Dataset**: This dataset is from the Santa Fe competition and is used for time series prediction.
7. **ACI-Financial Dataset**: This dataset contains financial time series data used for prediction tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Mackey-Glass Dataset**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
