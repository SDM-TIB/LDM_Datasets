To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Water Quality Prediction on a Sigfox-compliant IoT Device: The Road Ahead of WaterS" by Pietro Boccadoro et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **Tiziano Project dataset** for water quality parameters, which indicates that this is a key dataset for the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe the dataset characteristics, indicating that it was collected over a period from 2007 to 2012 and includes various water quality parameters such as pH, conductivity, oxygen, and temperature. They also mention that the dataset is one of the main outcomes of the Tiziano project.

In the **dataset characteristics subsection**, the authors provide more details about the Tiziano Project dataset, stating that it contains qualitative and quantitative information collected from different station probes in the Apulia region of Italy. They specify that the dataset includes parameters like average temperature, electric conductivity, medium dissolved oxygen, and pH, collected at a fixed pace of one sample per hour over five years.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Tiziano Project dataset. The authors reference it as follows:

- For the **Tiziano Project dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Puglia, “Progetto Tiziano—Sistema di monitoraggio acque sotterranee,” 2006.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Tiziano Project dataset, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and completeness.
