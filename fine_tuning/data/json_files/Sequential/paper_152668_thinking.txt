To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Robust Heterogeneous Signal Features from Parallel Neural Network for Audio Sentiment Analysis" by Feiyang Chen and Ziqian Luo, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the **Multimodal Opinion-level Sentiment Intensity (MOSI)** dataset, which indicates that this dataset is used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any additional datasets mentioned. The authors discuss the challenges of audio sentiment analysis and reference the **Multimodal Opinion Utterances Dataset (MOUD)**, which is another dataset used in their research.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used. The authors provide specific information about the **CMU-MOSI dataset**, stating it consists of 2,199 opinionated utterances from 93 videos, annotated with sentiment scores. They also mention the **MOUD dataset**, which contains product review videos in Spanish.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

1. For the **CMU-MOSI dataset**, the citation is:
   > A. Zadeh, R. Zellers, E. Pincus, L.-P. Morency, "MOSI: Multimodal Corpus of Sentiment Intensity and Subjectivity Analysis in Online Opinion Videos," arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.06259, 2016.

2. For the **MOUD dataset**, the citation is:
   > V. Pérez-Rosas, R. Mihalcea, L.-P. Morency, "Utterance-level Multimodal Sentiment Analysis," in Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), 2013, pp. 973–982.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will involve creating a structured output that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
