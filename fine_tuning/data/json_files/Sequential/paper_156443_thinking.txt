To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hate Speech and Offensive Content Detection in Indo-Aryan Languages: A Battle of LSTM and Transformers" by Nikhil Narayan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the paper contributes to the HASOC 2023 shared tasks for hate speech detection in low-resource languages, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset Description)**, as it is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors describe datasets for different languages involved in the tasks:

1. **SOLD (Sinhala Offensive Language Detection) Dataset**: This dataset consists of 10,000 manually annotated tweets divided into two classes: Offensive and Not Offensive. The dataset for the task contains 7,500 samples for training and 2,500 for testing.

2. **Gujarati Dataset**: This dataset includes 200 tweets for training and 1,196 tweets for testing. It is a binary classification problem with a few-shot setting.

3. **Assamese, Bodo, and Bengali Datasets**: These datasets are part of Task 4, with data collected from X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, and YouTube comments. Each dataset contains tweet-label pairs for training, while the test set consists of tweets without labels.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **SOLD dataset**, the citation is:
  > T. Ranasinghe, I. Anuradha, D. Premasiri, K. Silva, H. Hettiarachchi, L. Uyangodage, M. Zampieri. *SOLD: Sinhala Offensive Language Dataset*. arXiv:2212.00851, 2022.

- For the **Gujarati dataset**, the citation is:
  > K. G. Aditya Shankar Pal. *Annihilate Hates (Gujarati)*. Kaggle Competition, 2023. URL: https://kaggle.com/competitions/annihilate-hates-gujarati.

- For the **Assamese, Bodo, and Bengali datasets**, the citation is:
  > K. Ghosh, A. Senapati, A. S. Pal. *Annihilate Hates (Task 4, HASOC 2023): Hate Speech Detection in Assamese, Bengali, and Bodo Languages*. In Proceedings of the 15th Annual Meeting of the Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation, FIRE 2023, Goa, India. December 15-18, 2023.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the paper.
