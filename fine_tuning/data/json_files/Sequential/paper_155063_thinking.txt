To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mastering the Explicit Opinion-role Interaction: Syntax-aided Neural Transition System for Unified Opinion Role Labeling" by Shengqiong Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors achieved new state-of-the-art results on the MPQA benchmark, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation methods. In this section, they mention using the **MPQA v2.0 dataset** for their experiments. This is a clear indication that this dataset is central to their research.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the methodology or results sections. The authors specifically mention that they used the MPQA v2.0 dataset, which consists of 132 documents for development and 350 documents for testing, following a five-fold cross-validation approach.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MPQA v2.0 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Wiebe, J., Wilson, T., & Cardie, C. (2005). Annotating Expressions of Opinions and Emotions in Language. *Language Resources and Evaluation*, 39(2-3), 165-210.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section to confirm the dataset used.
3. Locate the full citation in the references section.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry based on this information.
