To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating the Robustness of Neural Language Models to Input Perturbations" by Milad Moradi and Matthias Samwald, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to look for specific dataset names and descriptions in the main body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (NLP tasks)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention five datasets, each associated with a specific NLP task:

1. **TREC**: A Text Classification (TC) dataset containing over 6,000 questions categorized into 50 different class labels.
2. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**: A Sentiment Analysis (SA) dataset with more than 11,000 movie reviews from Rotten Tomatoes, classified into five sentiment categories.
3. **CoNLL-2003**: A Named Entity Recognition (NER) dataset comprising news stories from the Reuters corpus, with over 200,000 tokens annotated as various entity types.
4. **STS benchmark**: A Semantic Similarity (SS) dataset containing over 8,000 text pairs from image captions, news headlines, and user forums, each assigned a similarity score.
5. **WikiQA (WQA)**: A Question Answering (QA) dataset consisting of over 3,000 questions and 29,000 sentences as answers extracted from Wikipedia.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
