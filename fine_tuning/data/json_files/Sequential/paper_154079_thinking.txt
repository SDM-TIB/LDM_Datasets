To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Augmented Skeleton Based Contrastive Action Learning with Momentum LSTM for Unsupervised Action Recognition" by Haocong Rao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on several public datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they explicitly mention four datasets:

1. **NTU RGB+D 60 Action Dataset**: This dataset includes 60 classes of actions collected from 40 different subjects, totaling 56,578 action skeleton sequences. The authors provide two evaluation protocols: Cross-Subject (C-Sub) and Cross-View (C-View).

2. **NTU RGB+D 120 Action Dataset**: An extension of the NTU RGB+D 60 dataset, it contains 120 actions from 106 subjects, with a total of 113,945 action skeleton sequences. Similar to the previous dataset, it offers Cross-Subject (C-Sub) and Cross-Setup (C-Set) evaluation protocols.

3. **SBU Kinect Interaction Dataset**: This dataset consists of two-person interactions and includes 282 short videos with depth images, RGB images, and 3D skeletons. It contains 8 types of interactions.

4. **UWA3D Multiview Activity II**: This dataset includes 30 different actions performed by 10 subjects, with samples from four different views. The total number of action sequences is 1,075.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
