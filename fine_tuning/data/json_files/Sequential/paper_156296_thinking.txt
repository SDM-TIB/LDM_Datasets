To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data-driven Preference Learning Methods for Sorting Problems with Multiple Temporal Criteria" by Yijun Lia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed models on synthetic data scenarios and a real-case study, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their empirical evaluations. In this section, they mention using a dataset sourced from a prominent global Internet company, which includes four distinct time series related to user behavior in a mobile gaming app.

I will extract the details of the datasets mentioned:

1. **Mobile Gaming User Behavior Dataset**: This dataset includes four time series:
   - **Purchase Amounts (CNY)**: Total payment made by each user at each timestamp.
   - **Purchase Frequency**: Frequency of purchases made by each user at each timestamp.
   - **Time Spent (hours)**: Total time each user engages in the game.
   - **Log-in Frequency**: Frequency of user log-ins to the game.

The dataset comprises 3,080 users categorized as either "high-value" or "low-value" based on their in-game purchases over a specified period.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since this dataset is derived from a real-world application and not from a specific published source, it may not have a formal citation like other datasets.

For the synthetic datasets used in the simulation experiments, I will also look for any references or descriptions provided in the paper. The authors describe generating synthetic data using a Fourier decomposition method, but again, this may not correspond to a formal dataset citation.

In summary, I will compile the following dataset information:

1. **Mobile Gaming User Behavior Dataset**:
   - Description: Contains four time series related to user behavior in a mobile gaming app, including purchase amounts, purchase frequency, time spent, and log-in frequency.
   - Citation: Not applicable (derived from a real-world application).

2. **Synthetic Datasets**:
   - Description: Generated using Fourier decomposition to create time series data with varying complexities and temporal patterns.
   - Citation: Not applicable (generated for the purpose of the study).

After gathering this information, I will ensure that it is clearly documented for future reference or processing.
