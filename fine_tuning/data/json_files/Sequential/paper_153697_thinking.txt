To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Zooming Slow-Mo: Fast and Accurate One-Stage Space-Time Video Super-Resolution" by Xiaoyu Xiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention using the **Vimeo-90K dataset** for training, which consists of over 60,000 7-frame video sequences. This is a significant dataset for video frame interpolation and super-resolution tasks.

The authors also mention using **Vid4** and **Vimeo testset** as evaluation datasets. They provide details about how they split the Vimeo testset into subsets based on motion conditions, which further emphasizes the importance of these datasets in their evaluation process.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Vimeo-90K dataset**, the citation is:
   > Tianfan Xue, Baian Chen, Jiajun Wu, Donglai Wei, and William T Freeman. *Video enhancement with task-oriented flow*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 127(8):1106–1125, 2019.

2. For the **Vid4 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ce Liu and Deqing Sun. *A bayesian approach to adaptive video super resolution*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 209–216. IEEE, 2011.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Vimeo-90K**: A dataset containing over 60,000 7-frame video sequences, widely used for video frame interpolation and super-resolution tasks.
- **Vid4**: A dataset used for evaluating video super-resolution methods, consisting of various video sequences.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete for future reference or processing.
