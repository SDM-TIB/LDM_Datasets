To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Unsupervised Sparsespeech Acoustic Models with Categorical Reparameterization" by Benjamin Milde and Chris Biemann, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the model is trained and evaluated on the **Libri-Light corpus**, which is a benchmark for ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) with limited or no supervision. This indicates that the Libri-Light corpus is a key dataset used in this research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of obtaining transcribed speech data and emphasizes the importance of untranscribed speech data. It mentions that the model is trained on **600h and 6000h of English read speech** from the Libri-Light corpus, confirming its significance in the study.

In the **evaluation** section, the authors specify that they evaluate their models on two proposed evaluation tasks in the Libri-Light corpus: completely unsupervised and semi-supervised with limited supervision on English audio book read speech. This reinforces the use of the Libri-Light corpus as a primary dataset.

I will also check the **references** section to find the full citation for the Libri-Light corpus. The relevant citation is:

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Libri-Light corpus. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
