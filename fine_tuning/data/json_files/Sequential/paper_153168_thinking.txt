To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GENESIS: Generative Scene Inference and Sampling with Object-Centric Latent Representations" by Martin Engelcke et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors trained GENESIS on several publicly available datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Coloured Multi-dSprites**: This dataset is described as containing images with randomly selected "sprites" and is referenced with a citation to Burgess et al. (2019).

2. **GQN Dataset**: The authors refer to the "rooms-ring-camera" dataset, which includes simulated 3D scenes. This dataset is cited with a reference to Eslami et al. (2018).

3. **ShapeStacks**: This dataset consists of images showing simulated block towers and is cited with a reference to Groth et al. (2018).

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of these datasets:

- For **Coloured Multi-dSprites**, the citation is:
  > Burgess, C. P., Matthey, L., Watters, N., Kabra, R., Higgins, I., Botvinick, M., & Lerchner, A. (2019). MONet: Unsupervised Scene Decomposition and Representation. arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.11390.

- For **GQN Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Eslami, S. M. A., Heess, N., Weber, T., Tassa, Y., Szepesvari, C., Hinton, G. E., et al. (2018). Neural Scene Representation and Rendering. Science, 360(6389), 1204-1210.

- For **ShapeStacks**, the citation is:
  > Groth, O., Fuchs, F. B., Posner, I., & Vedaldi, A. (2018). ShapeStacks: Learning Vision-Based Physical Intuition for Generalised Object Stacking. European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
