To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Overcoming Multi-model Forgetting" by Yassine Benyahia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new loss function to address multi-model forgetting, but it does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of catastrophic forgetting when training models sequentially. They reference previous works but do not mention specific datasets yet. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors describe their experiments in detail. They mention using the **MNIST dataset** for handwritten digit recognition and the **PTB dataset** for language modeling. They also refer to the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for image classification tasks. This is a crucial step as it provides the names of the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. 2010.

2. **PTB Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Marcus, M., Kim, G., Marcinkiewicz, M. A., MacIntyre, R., Bies, A., Ferguson, M., Katz, K., and Schasberger, B. *The Penn Treebank: Annotating Predicate Argument Structure*. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Human Language Technology, pages 114â€“119, Association for Computational Linguistics, 1994.

3. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*. 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its corresponding citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
