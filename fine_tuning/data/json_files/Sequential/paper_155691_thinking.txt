To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep learning for ECoG brain-computer interface: end-to-end vs. hand-crafted features" by Maciej Sliwowski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information and provide full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study compares models using raw ECoG signals and hand-crafted features, which suggests that there is a dataset involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, specifically **section 2.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used in their study. Here, they mention that the dataset was collected as part of a clinical trial titled "BCI and Tetraplegia" (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02550522). This is a crucial piece of information as it provides context for the dataset.

In this section, the authors detail that the dataset consists of recordings from a tetraplegic patient performing motor imagery tasks, with a total duration of over 600 minutes. They also mention that the dataset was collected over 44 experimental sessions, which is important for understanding the dataset's scale.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **Results** or **Discussion** sections, but it appears that the primary dataset is the one described in section 2.1.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the dataset. The paper references the clinical trial and provides the registration number, which is essential for citation purposes. The citation for the dataset will be:

> Sliwowski, M., Martin, M., Souloumiac, A., Blanchart, P., & Aksenova, T. (2022). Decoding ECoG signal into 3D hand translation using deep learning. *Journal of Neural Engineering*, 19(2), 026023. https://doi.org/10.1088/1741-2552/ac5d69

This citation refers to the paper itself, which describes the dataset used in the study. Since the dataset is derived from a clinical trial, I will also include the clinical trial citation:

> Benabid, A.L., Costecalde, T., Eliseyev, A., Charvet, G., Verney, A., Karakas, S., Foerster, M., Lambert, A., Morinière, B., Abroug, N., Schaeffer, M.C., Moly, A., Sauter-Starace, F., Ratel, D., Moro, C., Torres-Martinez, N., Langar, L., Oddoux, M., Polosan, M., Pezzani, S., Auboiroux, V., Aksenova, T., Mestais, C., Chabardes, S. (2019). An exoskeleton controlled by an epidural wireless brain–machine interface in a tetraplegic patient: a proof-of-concept demonstration. *The Lancet Neurology*, 18(12), 1112–1122. https://doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(19)30321-7

Finally, I will compile the dataset information and citations into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details about the dataset used in the research paper.
