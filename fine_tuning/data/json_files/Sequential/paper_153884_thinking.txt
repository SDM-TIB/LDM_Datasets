To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "An Effective Dynamic Spatio-temporal Framework with Multi-Source Information for Traffic Prediction" by Jichen Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **NYC-Taxi** and **NYC-Bike** datasets, which is a strong indication that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **NYC-Taxi Dataset**: This dataset consists of 22,349,490 taxi trip records collected from January 1, 2015, to March 1, 2015. 

2. **NYC-Bike Dataset**: This dataset contains 2,605,648 trip records from July 1, 2016, to August 29, 2016.

The authors also specify that they used the last twenty days of data from both datasets as testing data, which is important for understanding the context of the datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the datasets themselves are not typically cited in the references section of a paper unless they are published datasets. In this case, I will provide the citations based on the information available in the paper:

- For the **NYC-Taxi Dataset**, the citation is:
  > NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission. *Taxi and Limousine Commission Trip Record Data*. Available at: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page.

- For the **NYC-Bike Dataset**, the citation is:
  > NYC Department of Transportation. *Citi Bike Trip Data*. Available at: https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper referencing in research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured output that is ready for review or further processing.
