To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The FaCells: An Exploratory Study about LSTM Layers on Face Sketches Classifiers" by Xavier Ignacio González, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset called **CelebA**, which is a strong indicator that there are datasets relevant to the study.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the CelebA dataset in detail, noting that it contains over 260,000 photos labeled with 40 attributes. This is a significant dataset for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **methods** section. The author describes the process of converting images from the CelebA dataset into line drawings, but does not mention any other datasets. Therefore, it appears that CelebA is the primary dataset used for the experiments.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CelebA dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **CelebA Dataset**: 
  > Z. Liu, P. Luo, X. Wang, and X. Tang. "Deep learning face attributes in the wild." In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 3730–3738, 2015. doi: 10.1109/ICCV.2015.425.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned and utilized in the experiments, I will compile the information into a structured format.

Now, I will summarize the findings:

1. **CelebA Dataset**: This dataset contains over 260,000 celebrity images with 40 attribute labels, which were used to train the LSTM model for gender classification in face sketches.

With this information, I can now prepare the dataset entry for the CelebA dataset, ensuring that the citation is included for proper attribution.
