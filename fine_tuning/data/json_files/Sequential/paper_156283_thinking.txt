To extract datasets from the research paper titled "QXAI: Explainable AI Framework for Quantitative Analysis in Patient Monitoring Systems" by Thanveer Shaik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper, as these sections typically provide insights into the datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the proposed QXAI framework using specific datasets, which indicates that I should look for their names and details.

Next, I will focus on **Section V (Experiment)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **PPG-DaLiA**: This dataset consists of physiological and motion data collected from 15 subjects performing various activities. It includes 11 attributes such as 3D acceleration data, ECG, respiration, BVP, EDA, and body temperature.

2. **MHEALTH**: This dataset includes body motion data from ten volunteers performing 12 physical activities, recorded from three sensors. It contains 21 independent attributes, including acceleration, gyroscope, and magnetometer data.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **PPG-DaLiA**, the citation is:
  > A. Reiss, I. Indlekofer, P. Schmidt, and K. Van Laerhoven. "Deep PPG: Large-scale heart rate estimation with convolutional neural networks." *Sensors*, vol. 19, no. 14, p. 3079, 2019.

- For **MHEALTH**, the citation is:
  > O. Banos, R. Garcia, J. A. Holgado-Terriza, M. Damas, H. Pomares, I. Rojas, A. Saez, and C. Villalonga. "mHealthDroid: A novel framework for agile development of mobile health applications." In *Ambient Assisted Living and Daily Activities*, pp. 91–98, Springer International Publishing, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I have extracted the following datasets from the paper:

1. **PPG-DaLiA**
   - Citation: A. Reiss, I. Indlekofer, P. Schmidt, and K. Van Laerhoven. "Deep PPG: Large-scale heart rate estimation with convolutional neural networks." *Sensors*, vol. 19, no. 14, p. 3079, 2019.

2. **MHEALTH**
   - Citation: O. Banos, R. Garcia, J. A. Holgado-Terriza, M. Damas, H. Pomares, I. Rojas, A. Saez, and C. Villalonga. "mHealthDroid: A novel framework for agile development of mobile health applications." In *Ambient Assisted Living and Daily Activities*, pp. 91–98, Springer International Publishing, 2014.

With this information, I am ready to proceed with any further processing or analysis required.
