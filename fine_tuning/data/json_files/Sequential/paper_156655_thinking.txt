To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepVARMA: A Hybrid Deep Learning and VARMA Model for Chemical Industry Index Forecasting" by Xiang Li and Hu Yang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on forecasting the chemical industry index, which suggests that relevant datasets may be included.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention that the primary dataset consists of the **Synthetic Materials Index** spanning from April 2, 2021, to April 1, 2024. This dataset includes indices for synthetic fibers, plastics, and rubber, which are crucial for the study.

The authors also indicate that external variables such as energy indices, exchange rates, and the price of wheel steel (transportation index) are included as exogenous variables influencing the dependent variables. This information is essential for understanding the context of the datasets used.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are derived from specific indices and external sources rather than individual research papers, I will note the sources from which the data was obtained:

1. **Synthetic Materials Index**: Data sourced from the Steel Union Data Center, the National Bureau of Statistics, and Wind Financial Terminal. Since these are not formal publications, I will summarize them as follows:
   - Steel Union Data Center
   - National Bureau of Statistics
   - Wind Financial Terminal

Next, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets as required. 

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

- **Synthetic Materials Index**: Includes indices for synthetic fibers, plastics, and rubber, sourced from the Steel Union Data Center, National Bureau of Statistics, and Wind Financial Terminal.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing.
