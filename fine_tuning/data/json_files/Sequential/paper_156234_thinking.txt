To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hiding Backdoors within Event Sequence Data via Poisoning Attacks" by Elizaveta Kovtun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "three open transaction datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods** section, particularly the **Data Overview** subsection, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets related to financial transaction histories, specifically for the tasks of churn prediction, age classification, and marital status classification. 

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Churn Dataset**: This dataset consists of transaction sequences used to predict customer churn. The authors provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of sequences and unique tokens.

2. **Age Dataset**: This dataset is used to predict the age class of clients based on their transaction history. Similar statistics are provided as for the churn dataset.

3. **Status Dataset**: This dataset is utilized to determine the marital status of clients from their transaction sequences. Again, the authors provide relevant statistics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets that are referenced. However, in this case, the datasets are described as "open-access datasets" without specific citations provided in the references. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are not attributed to specific papers or sources in the references.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the context in which they are used and any relevant statistics provided in the paper. Since the datasets are not linked to specific citations, I will indicate that they are open-access datasets without formal citations.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
