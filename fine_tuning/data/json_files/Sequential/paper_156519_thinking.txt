To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Online Hierarchical Energy Management System for Energy Communities, Complying with the Current Technical Legislation Framework" by Antonino Capillo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit references to datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Dataset presentation)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their analysis. Here, they mention that the dataset comes from an online open data supply belonging to the OpenAIRE European Project, which includes power generation figures for three residential PV plants and power consumption measures for 15 residential homes for the year 2019. This section provides specific details about the dataset, including the number of profiles and the time resolution.

I will also check **section 5.1 (Dataset information)** for additional details about the dataset, such as the minimum, maximum, and mean power values for each profile. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's characteristics.

After gathering the necessary information about the dataset, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the OpenAIRE dataset. Since the dataset is derived from a project, I will look for the appropriate citation format that includes the project name, year, and any relevant authors or organizations involved.

The citation for the dataset is likely to be:
> OpenAIRE. *OpenAIRE European Project*. Accessed: 2023-09-04. URL: [https://www.openaire.eu](https://www.openaire.eu).

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including its description and citation, into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details about the dataset used in the research paper.
