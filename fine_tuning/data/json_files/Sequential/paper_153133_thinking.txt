To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge-incorporating ESIM models for Response Selection in Retrieval-based Dialog Systems" by Jatin Ganhotra et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their models on the **Ubuntu** and **Advising datasets**, which suggests that these are the primary datasets of interest.

Next, I will focus on the **Problem Statement and Datasets** section, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will find specific information about each dataset:

1. **Ubuntu Dataset**: The paper describes this dataset as a collection of conversations from Ubuntu IRC logs, specifically designed to help solve user problems by selecting the correct next utterance based on the conversation context. It mentions that the training data contains over 100,000 complete conversations and the test data consists of 1,000 partial conversations.

2. **Advising Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing conversations between students and advisors, aimed at guiding students in course selection. The authors note that the dataset includes paraphrases and that the training data consists of 100,000 partial dialogs derived from 500 original dialogs.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for both datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and should be formatted correctly.

- For the **Ubuntu Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lowe, R.; Pow, N.; Serban, I.; and Pineau, J. (2015b). *The Ubuntu dialogue corpus: A large dataset for research in unstructured multi-turn dialogue systems*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.08909.

- For the **Advising Dataset**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation, it is often referenced in conjunction with the DSTC challenges. I will note that it is part of the DSTC7 challenge, which can be cited as:
  > Ganhotra, J., Patel, S. S., Fadnis, K. (2019). *Knowledge-incorporating ESIM models for Response Selection in Retrieval-based Dialog Systems*. In Proceedings of the Dialog System Technology Challenge 7 (DSTC7).

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and their respective citations, ready for further processing or review.
