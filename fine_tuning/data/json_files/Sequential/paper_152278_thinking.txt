To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combining Fully Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks for 3D Biomedical Image Segmentation" by Jianxu Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method using a dataset from the **ISBI Neuronal Structure Segmentation Challenge** and in-house image stacks for **3D fungus segmentation**. This suggests that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will look closely at the **experiments section** to gather more details about these datasets. In the experiments section, the authors describe the **3D Neuron Structures** dataset, which is from the ISBI challenge, consisting of two image stacks of 512 × 512 × 30 voxels. They also mention the **3D Fungus Structures** dataset, which consists of five stacks of grayscale images, each with dimensions of 853 × 877 pixels.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The ISBI Neuronal Structure Segmentation Challenge is referenced as follows:
- Cardona, A., Saalfeld, S., Preibisch, S., Schmid, B., Cheng, A., Pulokas, J., Tomancak, P., & Hartenstein, V. (2010). An integrated micro-and macroarchitectural analysis of the Drosophila brain by computer-assisted serial section electron microscopy. *PLoS Biol*, 8(10), e1000502.

For the in-house dataset, since it is not a standard dataset with a formal citation, I will note it as an in-house dataset without a specific citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the ISBI dataset and noting the in-house dataset appropriately. This will provide a clear and structured summary of the datasets used in the research paper.
