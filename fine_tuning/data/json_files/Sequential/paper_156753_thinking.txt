To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Benchmarking Neural Decoding Backbones towards Enhanced On-edge iBCI Applications" by Zhou Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, but I will need to look deeper into the methods and results sections for specific dataset details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss advancements in invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces (iBCIs) and mention the use of neural data for various applications. However, they do not specify any datasets here.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the **data processing** subsection, where the authors describe the dataset used in their study. They mention that the dataset includes neural and behavioral data recorded from nonhuman primates engaged in a random target reaching task. This is a crucial point as it indicates the dataset's purpose and context.

The authors reference a specific dataset from a prior work, denoted as [17]. I will need to locate this reference in the **References section** to obtain the full citation. The dataset includes neural recordings from the primary motor cortex (M1) and kinematic measurements of the subject's hand movements.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned as [17]. Upon reviewing the references, I find:

- For the dataset referenced as [17], the citation is:
  > Makin, J.G., O’Doherty, J.E., Cardoso, M.M., Sabes, P.N. *Superior arm-movement decoding from cortex with a new, unsupervised-learning algorithm*. Journal of Neural Engineering, 15(2), 026010, 2018.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extracted from the paper:

1. **Dataset Name**: Neural and Behavioral Data from Nonhuman Primates
   - **Description**: This dataset includes neural recordings from the primary motor cortex (M1) and kinematic measurements of the subject's hand movements during a random target reaching task. The neural activities are collected using a Utah array, and the dataset consists of multiple sessions of recordings.
   - **Full Citation**: Makin, J.G., O’Doherty, J.E., Cardoso, M.M., Sabes, P.N. *Superior arm-movement decoding from cortex with a new, unsupervised-learning algorithm*. Journal of Neural Engineering, 15(2), 026010, 2018.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their citations from the research paper.
