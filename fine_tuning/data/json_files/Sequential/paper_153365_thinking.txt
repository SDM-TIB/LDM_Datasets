To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Named Entity Recognition - Is there a glass ceiling?" by Tomasz Stanislawek et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the results are based on the **CoNLL 2003 dataset**, which is a significant dataset in the field of Named Entity Recognition (NER). This is a good starting point.

Next, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. The authors mention reproducing selected models for the **CoNLL 2003 dataset** and analyzing erroneous samples from the test set. This confirms that the CoNLL 2003 dataset is central to their research.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss their findings based on the CoNLL 2003 dataset and also mention the creation of new diagnostic datasets. I will need to check if these diagnostic datasets are named and described in detail.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors have created two types of diagnostic datasets:
1. **Document Context Sentences (DCS)**: This dataset contains sentences that require context to identify named entities correctly.
2. **Template Sentences (TS)**: This dataset is used to test the model's ability to detect proper boundaries of entities.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The **CoNLL 2003 dataset** citation is as follows:
- Tjong Kim Sang, Erik F., and Fien De Meulder. *Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 Shared Task: Language-Independent Named Entity Recognition*. In Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Natural Language Learning at HLT-NAACL 2003.

For the **Document Context Sentences (DCS)** and **Template Sentences (TS)**, since they are newly created datasets by the authors, I will cite them as follows:
- Stanislawek, Tomasz, Anna Wróblewska, Alicja Wójcicka, Daniel Ziembicki, and Przemysław Biecek. *Diagnostic Datasets for Named Entity Recognition*. Supplementary materials of "Named Entity Recognition - Is there a glass ceiling?".

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation.
