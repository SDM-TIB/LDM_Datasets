To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Achieving Fluency and Coherency in Task-oriented Dialog" by Rashmi Gangadharaiah et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of customer support chat transcripts and synthetic datasets like bAbI, which indicates that these are potential datasets to extract.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Proposed Approach)**, where the authors describe the datasets and metrics used in their evaluations. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **bAbI Tasks (Task 1 and Task 2)**: These are synthetic datasets designed for dialog systems, where users interact with an agent in a simulated restaurant reservation application. The authors note that these tasks are not suitable for their application due to the nature of the knowledge base.

2. **Internal Customer Support Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1000 chat transcripts from customer support interactions, specifically focusing on account issues. The authors describe the characteristics of this dataset, including its noisy nature and the preprocessing steps taken.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **bAbI Tasks**, the citation is:
  > Antoine Bordes, Y-Lan Boureau, and Jason Weston. *Learning end-to-end goal-oriented dialog*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1605.07683, 2017.

- The **Internal Customer Support Dataset** does not have a specific citation provided in the references, as it is an internal dataset used by the authors. However, I will note that it is derived from real customer interactions.

Now, I will compile the extracted datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets where applicable. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
