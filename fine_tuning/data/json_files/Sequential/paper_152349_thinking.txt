To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Universal Paraphrastic Sentence Embeddings" by John Wieting et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on various annotated textual similarity datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section** where the authors discuss their methodology and the datasets used for training and evaluation. They specifically mention using the **Paraphrase Database (PPDB)** for training their models, which is a key dataset.

In the **experiments section**, particularly in **section 4.1 (Data)**, the authors list the datasets they used for evaluation. They mention:

1. **SemEval Textual Similarity Datasets**: This includes datasets from the SemEval tasks from 2012 to 2015, which cover various domains such as news, tweets, and image descriptions. They specify that they used 22 datasets from these tasks.

2. **SICK Dataset**: The authors mention using the SICK dataset for evaluating sentence similarity and entailment tasks.

3. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank**: This dataset is used for sentiment classification tasks.

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Paraphrase Database (PPDB)**, the citation is:
  > Ganitkevitch, Juri, Durme, Benjamin Van, and Callison-Burch, Chris. *PPDB: The Paraphrase Database*. In HLT-NAACL. The Association for Computational Linguistics, 2013.

- For the **SICK Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marelli, Marco, Bentivogli, Luisa, Baroni, Marco, Bernardi, Raffaella, Menini, Stefano, and Zamparelli, Roberto. *SemEval-2014 Task 1: Evaluation of Compositional Distributional Semantic Models on Full Sentences through Semantic Relatedness and Textual Entailment*. In Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2014), 2014.

- For the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Socher, Richard, Perelygin, Alex, Wu, Jean, Chuang, Jason, Manning, Christopher D., Ng, Andrew, and Potts, Christopher. *Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality over a Sentiment Treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2013.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
