To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning a Generator Model from Terminal Bus Data" by Nikolay Stulov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may hint at the types of data used.

Next, I will focus on **Section II (Technical Introduction)** and **Section IV (Experiments and Results)**, as these sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and testing the models. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their sources, characteristics, and how they were generated or utilized in the experiments.

In the paper, the authors mention that they used **synthetic data generated for a typical power generator with OpenModelica**. This indicates that the dataset is not a standard benchmark dataset but rather a custom dataset created for the purpose of this research. I will note the details of this synthetic dataset, including how it was generated and any relevant parameters.

I will also check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the data generation process or any tools used, such as OpenIPSL, which is mentioned in the context of generating the synthetic data. 

The relevant citations I will extract include:

1. **OpenIPSL**: 
   > L. Vanfretti, T. Rabuzin, M. Baudette, and M. Murad. *itesla power systems library (iPSL): A modelica library for phasor time-domain simulations*. SoftwareX, vol. 5, pp. 84 â€“ 88, 2016.

2. **Power System Stability Reference** (for context on the generator model):
   > P. Kundur, N. Balu, and M. Lauby. *Power system stability and control*, ser. EPRI power system engineering series. McGraw-Hill, 1994.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing.
