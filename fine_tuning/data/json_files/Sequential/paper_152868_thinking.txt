To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "Neural Speed Reading with Structural-Jump-LSTM" by Christian Hansen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention the datasets used. In this case, it states that the authors conducted a comprehensive experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art models, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Evaluation)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they present a table (Table 1) that lists various datasets along with their statistics. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **IMDB**: A sentiment analysis dataset with 21,250 training samples, 3,750 validation samples, and 25,000 test samples.
2. **Yelp**: Another sentiment analysis dataset with 475,999 training samples, 84,000 validation samples, and 37,999 test samples.
3. **SST (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)**: A sentiment analysis dataset with 6,920 training samples, 872 validation samples, and 1,821 test samples.
4. **Rotten Tomatoes**: A sentiment analysis dataset with 9,594 training samples, 1,068 validation samples, and 1,068 test samples.
5. **DBPedia**: A topic classification dataset with 475,999 training samples, 84,000 validation samples, and 69,999 test samples.
6. **AG News**: A topic classification dataset with 101,999 training samples, 18,000 validation samples, and 7,599 test samples.
7. **CBT-CN**: A question answering dataset with 120,769 training samples, 2,000 validation samples, and 2,500 test samples.
8. **CBT-NE**: Another question answering dataset with 108,719 training samples, 2,000 validation samples, and 2,500 test samples.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
