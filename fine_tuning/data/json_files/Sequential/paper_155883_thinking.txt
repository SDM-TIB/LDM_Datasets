To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Brain Model State Space Reconstruction Using an LSTM Neural Network" by Yueyang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the application of an LSTM filter to both simulated and real EEG data, which suggests that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly the subsection titled **2.4 Training Data**. Here, the authors describe the generation of training data using a neural mass model, indicating that this dataset is simulated. They mention the importance of generating a variety of training data with different patterns and a wide range of parameters, but they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset.

I will also look for any references to real EEG data in the **testing section**. The authors mention using **intracranial EEG (iEEG) data** collected from patients with epilepsy, specifically noting that this data was recorded continuously from 15 patients. This indicates that there is a real-world dataset being utilized, and I will need to find the citation for this data.

In the **results section**, the authors present findings based on both simulated and real data, reinforcing the importance of these datasets in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** for any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The authors reference a study by Cook et al. (2013) regarding the use of implanted seizure advisory systems, which likely pertains to the real EEG data used in their analysis. The citation is as follows:

- For the **real EEG data**:
  > Cook MJ, O’Brien TJ, Berkovic SF, Murphy M, Morokoff A, Fabinyi G, et al. *Prediction of seizure likelihood with a long-term, implanted seizure advisory system in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy: a first-in-man study*. The Lancet Neurology. 2013 Jun;12(6):563–71.

The **simulated EEG data** does not have a specific citation since it is generated by the authors' own methodology based on the neural mass model. However, I will note that it is derived from the Jansen-Rit model, which is referenced in the paper.

In summary, I will compile the dataset entries as follows:

1. **Simulated EEG Data**: Generated using the Jansen-Rit model, no specific citation.
2. **Real EEG Data**: Collected from patients with epilepsy, cited as:
   > Cook MJ, O’Brien TJ, Berkovic SF, Murphy M, Morokoff A, Fabinyi G, et al. *Prediction of seizure likelihood with a long-term, implanted seizure advisory system in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy: a first-in-man study*. The Lancet Neurology. 2013 Jun;12(6):563–71.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
