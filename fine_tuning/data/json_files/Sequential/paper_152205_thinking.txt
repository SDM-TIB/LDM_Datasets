To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "Simplified Gating in Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks" by Yuzhen Lu and Fathi M. Salem, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the experiments were conducted on **two sequence datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention two public datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9), with each image being 28x28 pixels in size. The dataset is widely used for benchmarking image classification algorithms.

2. **IMDB Dataset**: This dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews from IMDB, labeled as either positive or negative sentiment. It is commonly used for sentiment analysis tasks in natural language processing.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For the **IMDB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 142-150, 2011.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for any subsequent analysis or research.
