To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Effectiveness of Low-Rank Matrix Factorization for LSTM Model Compression" by Genta Indra Winata et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to look deeper into the paper for specific dataset names.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various NLP tasks and mention the use of LSTM networks, but they do not specify datasets yet. I will continue to the **methodology** and **evaluation sections** where datasets are likely to be explicitly mentioned.

In **section 4 (Evaluation)**, the authors state that they evaluate their method using five different publicly available datasets. They specifically mention:

1. **Penn Treebank (PTB)**: This dataset is used for language modeling tasks. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Marcus, M. P., Marcinkiewicz, M. A., & Santorini, B. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313-330.

2. **WikiText-2 (WT-2)**: Another dataset used for language modeling tasks. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Merity, S., Xiong, C., Bradbury, J., & Socher, R. (2017). Pointer sentinel mixture models. In *International Conference on Learning Representations*.

3. **Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD)**: This dataset is used for question answering tasks. The citation is:
   > Rajpurkar, P., Zhang, J., Lopyrev, K., & Liang, P. (2016). SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text. In *Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing*.

4. **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI)**: This dataset is used for natural language inference tasks. The citation is:
   > Bowman, S. R., Angeli, G., Potts, C., & Manning, C. D. (2015). A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference. In *Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing*.

5. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-5)**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis tasks. The citation is:
   > Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J., Chuang, J., Manning, C. D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2013). Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank. In *Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing*.

Next, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the information extracted from the paper. This will prepare me for creating a structured output for further processing.
