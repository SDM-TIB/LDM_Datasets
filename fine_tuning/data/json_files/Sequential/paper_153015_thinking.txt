To extract datasets from the research paper titled "One-Shot Learning for Text-to-SQL Generation" by Dongjun Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments with four different text-to-SQL datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Advising Dataset**: This dataset consists of questions related to a course information database at a university, collected from a web page and students, and augmented by paraphrasing with manual inspection.

2. **ATIS Dataset**: This dataset contains questions on a flight booking system and is based on the SQL version processed by Finegan-Dollak et al. (2018).

3. **GeoQuery Dataset**: This dataset includes questions on a US geography database, also processed by Finegan-Dollak et al. (2018).

4. **Scholar Dataset**: This dataset consists of questions on an academic publication database, where questions were collected by crowdsourcing, and initial SQL queries were generated automatically and then manually inspected.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Advising Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Finegan-Dollak, C., Kummerfeld, J. K., Zhang, L., Ramanathan, K., Sadasivam, S., Zhang, R., & Radev, D. (2018). Improving text-to-sql evaluation methodology. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 351–360.

- For the **ATIS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Price, P. J. (1990). Evaluation of spoken language systems: The ATIS domain. In Speech and Natural Language: Proceedings of a Workshop Held at Hidden Valley, Pennsylvania, June 24-27, 1990.

- For the **GeoQuery Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zelle, J. M., & Mooney, R. J. (1996). Learning to parse database queries using inductive logic programming. In Proceedings of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pages 1050–1055.

- For the **Scholar Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Iyer, S., Konstas, I., Cheung, A., Krishnamurthy, J., & Zettlemoyer, L. (2017). Learning a neural semantic parser from user feedback. arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.08760.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the paper.
