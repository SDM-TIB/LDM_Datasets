To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Imputer: Sequence Modelling via Imputation and Dynamic Programming" by William Chan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the Imputer model is applied to end-to-end speech recognition tasks, which suggests that datasets related to speech recognition might be included.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **Wall Street Journal (WSJ) Dataset**: The authors state that they used the WSJ dataset, which consists of 82 hours of audio data for speech recognition tasks.

2. **LibriSpeech Dataset**: They also mention the LibriSpeech dataset, which contains 960 hours of audio data and is widely used for automatic speech recognition research.

To confirm the details, I will look for any additional information in the **methodology or results sections** that might provide insights into how these datasets were utilized or any specific splits or configurations used during the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Wall Street Journal (WSJ) Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Paul, D. and Baker, J. *The Design for the Wall Street Journal-based CSR Corpus*. In Speech and Natural Language, 1992.

- For the **LibriSpeech Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Panayotov, V., Chen, G., Povey, D., and Khudanpur, S. *LibriSpeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In ICASSP, 2015.

Having gathered this information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will allow for a clear and organized presentation of the datasets used in the research.
