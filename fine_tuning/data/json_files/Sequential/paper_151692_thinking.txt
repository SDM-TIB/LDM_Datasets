To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Decoding in Sequence Models Using Discrete Latent Variables" by Łukasz Kaiser et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on neural machine translation tasks, which suggests that datasets may be involved. I will look for any specific dataset names or references in these sections.

Next, I will move on to the **experiments section** (Section 5), as this is typically where datasets are explicitly mentioned. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets used, as well as any text that describes them. In this case, the authors mention using the WMT English-German translation task, which indicates that the WMT dataset is likely involved.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

From my reading, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **WMT English-German Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed Latent Transformer model. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Bojar, Ondřej, et al. "Findings of the 2017 Conference on Machine Translation (WMT17)." In Proceedings of the Second Conference on Machine Translation, pp. 169-214. 2017.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the experiments, it is referenced in the context of previous work on VQ-VAE. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Krizhevsky, Alex. "Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images." 2009.

3. **ImageNet Dataset**: This dataset is often used in conjunction with deep learning models and may be referenced in the context of related work. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Russakovsky, Olga, et al. "ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge." International Journal of Computer Vision 115.3 (2015): 211-252.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation by other researchers.
