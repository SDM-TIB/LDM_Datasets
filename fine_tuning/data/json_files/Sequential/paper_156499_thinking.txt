To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequential Model for Predicting Patient Adherence in Subcutaneous Immunotherapy for Allergic Rhinitis" by Yin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the **data collection** subsection, where the authors describe the patient population and the data collected. Here, they mention that data were collected from patient records, including demographic information and clinical scores, which indicates the presence of a dataset.

In the **results section**, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the data collected. For instance, Table 1 presents demographic and clinical data of the patients under subcutaneous immunotherapy, which is crucial for identifying the dataset's characteristics.

I will also check the **data availability statement** at the end of the paper, which may provide a link or reference to where the dataset can be accessed. The authors mention that the dataset can be found in the "Subcutaneous-Immunotherapy-Dataset repository," which is essential for citation.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets:

1. **Subcutaneous Immunotherapy Dataset**: This dataset includes records of 205 allergic rhinitis patients who underwent subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT). It contains demographic data (age, gender, distance to clinic, etc.) and clinical scores (symptom scores, medication scores) collected over multiple time points.

Next, I will retrieve the full citation for the dataset. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, but I will reference the paper where the dataset is described:

- For the **Subcutaneous Immunotherapy Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yin Li, Yu Xiong, Wenxin Fan, Kai Wang, Qingqing Yu, Liping Si, Patrick van der Smagt, Jun Tang, and Nutan Chen. *Sequential Model for Predicting Patient Adherence in Subcutaneous Immunotherapy for Allergic Rhinitis*. In Proceedings of the [Journal Name], [Volume], [Pages], [Year].

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and citation for further processing or review.
