To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Speech Recognition by Revising Gated Recurrent Units" by Mirco Ravanelli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses improvements in speech recognition but does not specify datasets. The introduction mentions advancements in deep learning for speech recognition but does not provide specific dataset names either.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two primary datasets:

1. **TIMIT Dataset**: This dataset is used for phoneme recognition tasks in a close-talking scenario. It is a well-known dataset in the speech recognition community.

2. **DIRHA-English Dataset**: This dataset is used for distant-talking scenarios and consists of both simulated and real parts. It is specifically designed for recognizing speech in domestic environments with noise.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **TIMIT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. Garofolo, L. F. Lamel, S. S. Fisher, J. G. Fiscus, and D. P. Pallett. *TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus LDC93S1*. Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia, 1993.

- For the **DIRHA-English Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Ravanelli, L. Cristoforetti, R. Gretter, M. Pellin, A. Sosi, and M. Omologo. *The DIRHA-English corpus and related tasks for distant-speech recognition in domestic environments*. In Proceedings of ASRU, 2015, pp. 275â€“282.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a clear and organized presentation of the datasets used in the research paper.
