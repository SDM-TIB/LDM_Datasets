To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Video Captioning with Boundary-aware Hierarchical Language Decoding and Joint Video Prediction" by Xiangxi Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two widely-used video captioning datasets, specifically naming **MSR-Video-to-Text (MSR-VTT)** and **YouTube-to-Text (MSVD)**. This is a strong indication that these datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will navigate to the **experiments section** (section 4.1) where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. Here, I will find the following information:

1. **Microsoft Video Description Corpus (MSVD)**: This dataset contains 1,970 YouTube video clips and 85,000 English descriptions collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk. The authors mention that they split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

2. **MSR-Video to Text (MSR-VTT)**: This dataset is described as a large-scale video description dataset containing 10,000 video clips collected from the Internet, totaling 41.2 hours of video. Each clip is annotated with approximately 20 natural sentences.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MSVD**, the citation is:
  > David L Chen and William B Dolan. *Collecting highly parallel data for paraphrase evaluation*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies-Volume 1, pages 190–200, 2011.

- For **MSR-VTT**, the citation is:
  > Jun Xu, Tao Mei, Ting Yao, and Yong Rui. *MSR-VTT: A large video description dataset for bridging video and language*. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016 IEEE Conference on, pages 5288–5296, 2016.

Now that I have gathered all necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
