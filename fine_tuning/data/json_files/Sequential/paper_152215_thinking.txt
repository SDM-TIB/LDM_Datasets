To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Way Out of the Odyssey: Analyzing and Combining Recent Insights for LSTMs" by Shayne Longpre et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions improvements in performance for text classification datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper. The introduction emphasizes the importance of having a competitive baseline for NLP tasks, suggesting that specific datasets will be referenced.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Experimental Results)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in experiments. Here, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**: This dataset is noted for containing well-curated, short sequence sentences. The authors reference the original paper that introduced this dataset.

2. **IMDB Sentiment Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing longer, colloquial sequences, and the authors provide details about how they split the training set for their experiments.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**, the citation is:
  > Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Y Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D Manning, Andrew Y Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of the conference on empirical methods in natural language processing (EMNLP), volume 1631, page 1642. Citeseer, 2013.

- For the **IMDB Sentiment Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 142â€“150, Portland, Oregon, USA, June 2011. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
