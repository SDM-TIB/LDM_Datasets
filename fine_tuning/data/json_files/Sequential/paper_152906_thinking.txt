To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cycle-SUM: Cycle-consistent Adversarial LSTM Networks for Unsupervised Video Summarization" by Li Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their method on "two video summarization benchmark datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed discussed in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the **experiment section**, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate Cycle-SUM on two benchmark datasets: **SumMe** and **TVSum**. This is a crucial step as it confirms the datasets used for their experiments.

Now, I will gather detailed descriptions of these datasets from the paper. The authors provide the following information:

1. **SumMe Dataset**: This dataset contains 25 videos ranging from 1 to 7 minutes, with frame-level binary importance scores. This dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the Cycle-SUM model in summarizing videos.

2. **TVSum Dataset**: This dataset consists of 50 videos downloaded from YouTube, with shot-level importance scores for each video ranging from 1 to 5. It serves as another benchmark for evaluating the summarization performance of the proposed model.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **SumMe Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gygli, M., Grabner, H., Riemenschneider, H., & Van Gool, L. (2014). Creating summaries from user videos. In *European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)*, 505–520.

- For **TVSum Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Song, Y., Vallmitjana, J., Stent, A., & Jaimes, A. (2015). TVSum: Summarizing web videos using titles. In *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*, 5179–5187.

Now that I have the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
