To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Investigation of Japanese PnG BERT language model in text-to-speech synthesis for pitch accent language" by Yusuke Yasuda and Tomoki Toda, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and it may mention specific datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluations section** (Section IV), as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any tables or descriptions that list the datasets, their characteristics, and their purposes.

In this paper, I notice that the authors mention using the **JSUT corpus** for training and validation in their experiments. I will take note of this dataset and look for additional details about it in the text.

I will also check the **background and methodology sections** to see if there are any other datasets referenced, particularly in relation to the training of the PnG BERT model or any other components of the TTS system.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For the **JSUT corpus**, I will find the citation:
> R. Sonobe, S. Takamichi, and H. Saruwatari. *JSUT corpus: free large-scale Japanese speech corpus for end-to-end speech synthesis*. CoRR, vol. abs/1711.00354, 2017.

If there are any other datasets mentioned, I will ensure to extract their names and corresponding citations in a similar manner.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
