To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simplified Long Short-term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks: Part III" by Atra Akandeh and Fathi M. Salem, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of LSTM models in various applications but do not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the **experiments section**.

In **section 3 (Experiments and Discussion)**, the authors state that they have trained their LSTM variants on the **MNIST dataset**. This is a well-known dataset used for handwritten digit recognition, and it is crucial to note this for our extraction.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is commonly cited as follows:

- For the MNIST dataset, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digit Images for Machine Learning Research*. 2010.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits, commonly used for training various image processing systems.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
