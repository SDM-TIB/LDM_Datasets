To extract datasets from the research paper titled "American Option Pricing using Self-Attention GRU and Shapley Value Interpretation" by Yanhui Shen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the study uses a dataset of SPY call options from January 2020 to December 2022, which indicates that there is a specific dataset being utilized.

Next, I will look into the **data preparation section (Section 4)**, where the author provides detailed information about the dataset. Here, I will find that the dataset consists of daily closing prices of SPY and SPY call options, totaling 2,794,966 records. This section also describes how the data is categorized into 15 subsets based on moneyness and days to maturity.

I will note the following key points about the dataset:

1. **SPY Call Options Dataset**: This dataset includes transaction records of SPY call options from January 2020 to December 2022. It is crucial for the analysis of American option pricing.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is sourced from Kaggle, I will include the citation as follows:

- For the SPY Call Options Dataset, the citation is:
  > Kyle Graupe. *SPY Daily EOD Options Quotes (2020-2022)*. Kaggle Dataset. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kylegraupe/spy-daily-eod-options-quotes-2020-2022.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation in a structured format.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entry for further processing or review.
