To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Classification of Pedagogical Content Using Conventional Machine Learning and Deep Learning Model" by Vedat Apuk and Krenare Pireva Nuçi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset from Coursera, which suggests that there is a specific dataset that I need to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically **section 3.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of **12,032 videos collected from the Coursera platform**, categorized into a hierarchical structure with various levels. This section provides essential details about the dataset, including its size and the nature of the content.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors refer to the dataset as being used in a previous study, which is indicated by the citation [19]. I will look up this reference to obtain the complete citation for the dataset.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Zenun Kastrati, Ali Shariq Imran, and Arianit Kurti. *Integrating word embeddings and document topics with deep learning in a video classification framework*. Pattern Recognition Letters, 128:85–92, 2019.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the steps I took to extract the dataset were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the methodology section to find detailed descriptions of the dataset.
3. Check the references for the full citation of the dataset used in the study.

With this information, I am ready to create the necessary entries for the dataset.
