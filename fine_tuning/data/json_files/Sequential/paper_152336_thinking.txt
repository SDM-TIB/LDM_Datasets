To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Focused Dynamic Attention Model for Visual Question Answering" by Ilija Ilievski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive evaluations on a large-scale benchmark dataset, which suggests that a dataset is involved. The introduction further elaborates on the VQA problem and hints at the use of specific datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention using the **Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset** for their experiments. They describe it as the largest and most complex dataset for the VQA task, containing 204,721 images from the Microsoft COCO dataset, along with human-posed questions and answers.

I will also check the **evaluation** section, where the authors confirm that they used the VQA dataset for their experiments, which reinforces its significance in their research.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the VQA dataset from the **references section**. The citation for the VQA dataset is as follows:
> Antol, S., Agrawal, A., Lu, J., Mitchell, M., Batra, D., Lawrence Zitnick, C., & Parikh, D. (2015). *VQA: Visual Question Answering*. In The IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the **Microsoft COCO dataset** as the source of images for the VQA dataset. Therefore, I will also include its citation:
> Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., & Zitnick, C.L. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2014. Springer.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets identified in the paper, ensuring to include their full citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for any further analysis or replication of the study.
