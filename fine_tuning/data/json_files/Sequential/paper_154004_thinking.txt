To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Time Series Analysis and Forecasting of COVID-19 Cases Using LSTM and ARIMA Models" by Arko Barman, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study uses time series data of COVID-19 cases, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Materials and Methods)**, specifically **subsection 3.1 (Dataset)**, where the author describes the dataset in detail. Here, the paper states that the time series data, including confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths due to COVID-19, is publicly available from researchers at Johns Hopkins University. This is a crucial detail as it specifies the source of the dataset.

The paper provides a URL to the dataset: 
> https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data

The dataset consists of daily cumulative numbers for confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths for almost all countries and individual US states. The author mentions that they used data from four specific countries: the US, Italy, Spain, and Germany, and that the data was updated daily until May 25, 2020.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is from a GitHub repository, I will format the citation accordingly:

- For the COVID-19 dataset from Johns Hopkins University, the citation is:
  > Dong E, Du H, Gardner L. An interactive web-based dashboard to track COVID-19 in real time. *The Lancet Infectious Diseases* 2020;20:533â€“4. doi:10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30120-1

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extracted from the paper:

1. **COVID-19 Time Series Dataset**: This dataset includes daily cumulative confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths for various countries, sourced from Johns Hopkins University.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset.
