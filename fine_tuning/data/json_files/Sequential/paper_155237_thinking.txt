To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Morpheme Boundary Detection & Grammatical Feature Prediction for Gujarati" by Jatayu Baxi and Dr. Brijesh Bhatt, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors have created a dataset of Gujarati words with lemma and grammatical features, which suggests that there is a specific dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Gujarati morphology and Data set Generation)**, as it is likely to contain detailed information about the dataset. In this section, the authors describe the dataset creation process and provide specific details about the types of words included in the dataset. They mention that they have prepared a gold dataset of **16,527 unique words**, categorized into nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

I will break down the dataset information as follows:

1. **Noun Dataset**: Contains **6,847 unique nouns** with corresponding root forms, gender, number, and case information.
2. **Verb Dataset**: Comprises **10,128 inflected verb forms**, each marked with root forms and linguistic features such as gender, number, person, tense, and aspect.
3. **Adjective Dataset**: Includes **3,346 inflected adjectives**, marked with features like type, gender, and number.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the **Gujarati Monolingual Text Corpus ILCI II corpus** as the source for their dataset creation. I will need to locate the citation for this corpus.

The citation for the **Gujarati Monolingual Text Corpus ILCI II corpus** is:
> Technology Development for Indian Languages (TDIL). "ILCI II Corpus." Available at: http://tdil.dc.in.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Gujarati Monolingual Text Corpus as the source of the dataset. 

Finally, I will summarize the extracted datasets, ensuring that each entry is clear and includes the necessary details and citations for future reference.
