To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Study on Intelligent Forecasting of Credit Bond Default Risk" by Kai Ren, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and while it may not list datasets, it sets the context for what to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the parts discussing data collection and the risk index system. Here, the author mentions collecting data from the **iFind platform**, which is crucial as it indicates the source of the datasets used in the study. I will note the total number of bonds analyzed, including both matured and defaulted bonds, as well as the specific features included in the risk index system.

In the **data collection section**, the author states that they collected data on **10,476 matured bonds and 763 defaulted bonds** from January 2014 to December 2022. This information is essential for understanding the scope of the datasets used.

I will also look for any references to specific datasets or studies that provide foundational data or methodologies. For instance, the paper cites various studies and methodologies that inform the risk index system and default probability annotations. I will extract these references to ensure that I have the full citations for any datasets or methodologies referenced.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the following datasets:

1. **Chinese Credit Bond Dataset**: This dataset includes daily frequency default probability labels for 7,361 credit bonds, which encompasses both high-risk (defaulted and below A-rated) and low-risk (matured) bonds. The dataset is derived from the iFind platform.

2. **Risk Index System Features**: The paper outlines a risk index system with 53 specific features categorized into seven dimensions. While this is not a dataset in the traditional sense, it is crucial for understanding the data used in the analysis.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for any datasets or methodologies mentioned. The citations will include foundational studies that inform the dataset construction and analysis.

For example, I will note the following references that are relevant to the datasets:

- For the **iFind platform** data collection:
  > All data used in the study are sourced from the iFind platform.

- For the **risk index system** and methodologies:
  > Liang, J. (2022). Research on corporate bond default prediction based on XGBoost model, 2022 Nankai University, MA thesis.

- Other relevant studies cited in the methodology that may provide context or additional datasets.

Finally, I will ensure that I have documented all relevant datasets and their citations clearly, ready for any further processing or review.
