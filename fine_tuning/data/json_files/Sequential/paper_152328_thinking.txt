To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Associative Long Short-Term Memory" by Ivo Danihelka et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used in experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. The authors may also provide details about how these datasets were utilized in their experiments.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any figures or tables that may summarize the datasets or their properties, as these can provide concise information about the datasets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial as it allows for proper attribution and enables others to locate the datasets easily.

From my reading, I note the following datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **ImageNet**: The authors refer to using a sequence of ImageNet images for their experiments. The citation for ImageNet is:
   > Russakovsky, Olga, Deng, Jia, Su, Hao, Krause, Jonathan, Satheesh, Sanjeev, Ma, Sean, Huang, Zhiheng, Karpathy, Andrej, Khosla, Aditya, Bernstein, Michael, Berg, Alexander C., and Fei-Fei, Li. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 115(3):211â€“252, 2015. doi: 10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y.

2. **English Wikipedia**: The authors mention using the English Wikipedia dataset for their sequence prediction task. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Hutter, Marcus. *The human knowledge compression contest*. 2006. URL http://prize.hutter1.net.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
