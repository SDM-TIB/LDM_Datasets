To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IIIDYT at SemEval-2018 Task 3: Irony detection in English tweets" by Edison Marrese-Taylor et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a system for irony detection in tweets, which suggests that a dataset is likely involved, especially since it mentions a shared task.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Data and pre-processing)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the dataset used for the experiments. Here, I find that the authors describe a balanced dataset of 4,792 tweets (2,396 ironic and 2,396 non-ironic). They explain how the dataset was constructed by collecting self-annotated tweets with specific hashtags and that it includes various types of irony.

The paper specifies the following details about the dataset:
- The dataset consists of 2,396 ironic tweets and 2,396 non-ironic tweets.
- The ironic tweets were collected using hashtags like #irony, #sarcasm, and #not.
- The dataset includes instances of verbal irony and situational irony.

Since the dataset is part of the SemEval-2018 shared task, I will look for the official reference to this dataset in the **References section**. The relevant citation for the dataset is:

> Cynthia Van Hee, Els Lefever, and VÃ©ronique Hoste. *SemEval-2018 Task 3: Irony Detection in English Tweets*. In Proceedings of the 12th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, SemEval-2018, New Orleans, LA, USA. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2018.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset information clearly and concisely.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that it includes the full citation and relevant details about the dataset, ready for structured output or further processing.
