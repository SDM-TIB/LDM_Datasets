To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving the Performance of the LSTM and HMM Model via Hybridization" by Larkin Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a general overview, but the methodology section is likely where the datasets are explicitly mentioned.

In the **methodology section**, the authors state that they compare the performance of their models on two specific datasets: **Tiny Shakespeare Dataset (TS)** and **War and Peace English Corpus (WP)**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are central to their experiments.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, it is important to note that the datasets themselves may not have dedicated citations in the references, as they are commonly used datasets in the field. Therefore, I will provide the most relevant citations for the works that introduced or popularized these datasets.

1. **Tiny Shakespeare Dataset (TS)**: This dataset is a collection of text from Shakespeare's works, often used for language modeling tasks. While the paper does not provide a specific citation, it is widely recognized in the community. A common reference for this dataset is:
   > "Tiny Shakespeare Dataset." Available at: https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn/blob/master/data/tinyshakespeare/input.txt

2. **War and Peace English Corpus (WP)**: This dataset consists of the text of Leo Tolstoy's "War and Peace." Similar to the Tiny Shakespeare Dataset, it is commonly used in language modeling. A typical citation for this dataset is:
   > "War and Peace." Available at: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2600

After identifying these datasets and their respective citations, I will ensure that I document them clearly, emphasizing the importance of providing full citations for each dataset as part of the extraction process.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all relevant information is included and accurately represented.
