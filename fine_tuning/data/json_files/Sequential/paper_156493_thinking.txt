To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing Medication Decisions for Patients with Atrial Fibrillation through Path Development Network" by Tian Xie, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on predicting anticoagulant therapy recommendations using ECG data, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to ECG recordings.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (ECG Data Analysis)**, particularly **subsection 4.1.1 (ECG Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of 12-channel ECG data recorded from 871 atrial fibrillation patients, capturing their daily ECGs and subsequent monitoring. The dataset includes both positive samples (indicating stroke occurrence) and negative samples (indicating no stroke), which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and application.

The authors also provide specific details about the dataset, such as the number of samples, the nature of the recordings, and the classification of the samples. This information is essential for accurately describing the dataset.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper does not explicitly provide a citation for the ECG dataset, but it mentions that the data was recorded in the Cardiology Department of Jiangsu Provincial People’s Hospital in China. Therefore, I will note this as the source of the dataset.

To summarize, I will extract the following dataset information:

1. **ECG Dataset**: 
   - Description: The dataset consists of 12-channel ECG data recorded from 871 atrial fibrillation patients, capturing their daily ECGs and subsequent monitoring. It includes 143 positive samples (indicating stroke occurrence) and 622 negative samples (indicating no stroke).
   - Source: Cardiology Department of Jiangsu Provincial People’s Hospital, China.

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset, I will note the source as the institution where the data was collected.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their sources, which is crucial for any subsequent analysis or reporting.
