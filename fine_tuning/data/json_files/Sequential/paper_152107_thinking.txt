To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling Multimodal Clues in a Hybrid Deep Learning Framework for Video Classification" by Yu-Gang Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on two benchmarks: **UCF-101** and **Columbia Consumer Videos (CCV)**. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be detailed further in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experimental setup section** (Section IV) where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they provide specific information about both datasets:

1. **UCF-101**: The authors describe it as a widely adopted dataset for human action recognition, containing 13,320 video clips annotated into 101 human actions, totaling 27 hours of video. They mention that experiments were conducted using three training and testing splits.

2. **Columbia Consumer Videos (CCV)**: This dataset consists of 9,317 videos collected from YouTube, belonging to 20 categories such as "basketball," "wedding dance," and "soccer." The authors specify that they used a training set of 4,659 videos and a testing set of 4,658 videos.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

- For **UCF-101**, the citation is:
  > K. Soomro, A. R. Zamir, and M. Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. CoRR, 2012.

- For **Columbia Consumer Videos (CCV)**, the citation is:
  > Y.-G. Jiang, G. Ye, S.-F. Chang, D. Ellis, and A. C. Loui. *Consumer video understanding: A benchmark database and an evaluation of human and machine performance*. In ICMR, 2011.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper along with their proper citations.
