To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hydroelectric Generation Forecasting with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Based Deep Learning Model for Turkey" by Mehmet Bulut, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for forecasting hydroelectric generation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, which can help identify them.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the author likely describes the datasets in detail. In this paper, the author mentions using a dataset covering Turkey's monthly hydroelectric production values from January 2007 to December 2018. This is a crucial dataset for the study, and I will note its specifics, including the time range and the type of data it contains.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **results or discussion sections**. The author may refer to other datasets used for validation or comparison purposes, which are important to include.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets that are derived from other studies or sources. In this case, the paper mentions that the dataset was provided by Turkey's hydroelectric transmission system operator (TSO), which is a key source that I need to cite.

The main dataset I will extract is:
1. **Monthly Hydroelectric Generation Dataset**: This dataset includes monthly production values from January 2007 to December 2018, which is essential for the forecasting model.

The citation for the dataset source is:
> TEIAŞ (Turkish Electricity Transmission Co), “Load Dispatch Information System (YTBS)”, 2020. [Online]. Available: https://ytbsbilgi.teias.gov.tr/ytbsbilgi/frm_istatistikler.jsf. [Accessed: 15-October-2020].

Now, I will compile the extracted dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset source. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details for future reference or analysis.
