To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Representation of Imbalanced Spatio-temporal Traffic Flow Data for Traffic Accident Detection" by Pouya Mehrannia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "real accident and loop detector data collected from the Twin Cities Metro freeways of Minnesota." This suggests that there are specific datasets being utilized.

Next, I will examine **section III (Data Preparation)**, where the authors describe the data used in their study. Here, they mention two key datasets:

1. **Loop Detector Data**: This dataset is collected continuously from over 4,500 loop detectors located around the Twin Cities Metro freeways, providing various traffic metrics such as capacity, density, flow, headway, occupancy, and speed.

2. **Accident Records Dataset**: This dataset contains records of all accidents that occurred in the experiment sites over the past 10 years, including date and time stamps of the accidents.

In the **acknowledgment section**, the authors specify that the loop detector data and accident dataset were provided by the Minnesota Department of Transportation, which is crucial for citing the source of the datasets.

Now, I will look for the full citations for these datasets in the **References section** of the paper. The citation for the accident records dataset is:

- **Minnesota Department of Transportation**. (2020). "Minnesota crash records system. [electronic dataset]." Roseville, MN: Minnesota Department of Transportation. Retrieved on 28 January 2020.

The loop detector data is also attributed to the Minnesota Department of Transportation, but since it is part of the same acknowledgment, I will use the same citation for both datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured representation of the datasets used in the research.
