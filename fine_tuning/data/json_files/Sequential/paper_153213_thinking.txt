To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Restricted Recurrent Neural Networks" by Enmao Diao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not contain detailed information about datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the **experiments section**, as it typically contains information about the datasets used for evaluation.

In the **experiments section (Section IV)**, the authors mention conducting experiments on two specific datasets: 

1. **Penn Treebank (PTB) Dataset**: This dataset is recognized as a benchmark for language modeling experiments. It consists of 929k training words, 73k validation words, and 82k test words, with a vocabulary of 10k words.

2. **WikiText-2 (WT2) Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from Wikipedia articles and is noted to be more challenging than the PTB dataset. It contains 2M training words, 210K validation words, and 240K test words, with a vocabulary of 33,278 words.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Penn Treebank Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mikolov, T., Karafiát, M., Burget, L., Černocký, J., & Khudanpur, S. (2010). *Recurrent neural network based language model*. In Eleventh annual conference of the international speech communication association.

- For the **WikiText-2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Merity, S., Xiong, C., Bradbury, J., & Socher, R. (2016). *Pointer sentinel mixture models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.07843.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and provided the necessary citations for each.
