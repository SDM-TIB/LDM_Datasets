The individuals were doing daily life work carrying the smartphone at waist position and the smartphone was embedded with the inertial sensors. There are six actions performed by each person: Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying. The data is already processed by noise filters and sampled using a 2.5 seconds window with an overlap of 50%. The data is acquired using tri-axial linear acceleration and tri-axial gyroscope at a rate of 50Hz.",
