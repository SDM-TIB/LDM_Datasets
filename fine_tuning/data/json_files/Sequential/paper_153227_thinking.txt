To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scientific Statement Classification over arXiv.org" by Deyan Ginev and Bruce R. Miller, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors released a large-scale dataset derived from the arXiv.org collection, which is a good starting point for identifying the dataset.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Dataset Preparation)**, where the authors discuss the dataset in detail. They mention that they extracted **10.5 million annotated paragraphs** from the arXiv collection, which is crucial information. I will note that this dataset is intended for a classification task involving scientific statements.

In **section 2.1 (Label selection)**, the authors describe the process of selecting labels for the dataset, which further confirms the dataset's structure and purpose. They also mention that the dataset is organized into **50 distinct labels**, which is important for understanding its application.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the arXMLiv project, which is the source of the dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **arXMLiv dataset**, the citation is:
  > Deyan Ginev. *arXMLiv:08.2018 dataset, an HTML5 conversion of arXiv.org*. Available at: https://sigmathling.kwarc.info/resources/arxmliv-dataset-082018/, 2018.

Additionally, I will note that the dataset is made available for public use, which is significant for reproducibility and further research.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Dataset Name**: arXMLiv:08.2018 dataset
   - **Description**: A large-scale dataset derived from the arXiv.org collection, containing 10.5 million annotated paragraphs for scientific statement classification.
   - **Citation**: Deyan Ginev. *arXMLiv:08.2018 dataset, an HTML5 conversion of arXiv.org*. Available at: https://sigmathling.kwarc.info/resources/arxmliv-dataset-082018/, 2018.

After gathering all this information, I will compile it into a structured format for further processing or review.
