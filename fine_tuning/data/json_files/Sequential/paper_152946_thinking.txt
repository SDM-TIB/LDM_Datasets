To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conditioning LSTM Decoder and Bi-directional Attention Based Question Answering System" by Heguang Liu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the model's performance but does not specify datasets. The introduction mentions the **Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD)**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Background)**, where the author explicitly describes the SQuAD dataset. Here, it is stated that SQuAD consists of over 100,000 question-answer pairs derived from more than 500 articles. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's purpose and significance in the context of the research.

In **section 4.1 (Training Data)**, the author reiterates the use of the SQuAD dataset, detailing its composition and how it is utilized in the experiments. This confirms that SQuAD is indeed the primary dataset used for training and evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SQuAD dataset. The citation provided is:
> P. Rajpurkar, J. Zhang, K. Lopyrev, and P. Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. CoRR, abs/1606.05250, 2016.

Since SQuAD is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for SQuAD, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately for downstream processing.
