To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Enhancing Speech Emotion Recognition Through Differentiable Architecture Search" by Thejan Rajapakshe et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention that they experimented with the **IEMOCAP** and **MSP-IMPROV** datasets, which indicates that these are the datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look into the **experimental setup section** (Section IV) where the authors provide more details about the datasets. Here, they confirm that they used the **IEMOCAP** dataset, which is described as an improvised subset with four categorical labels: happiness, sadness, anger, and neutral. They also mention the **MSP-IMPROV** dataset, indicating its use in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **IEMOCAP dataset**, the citation is:
   > Carlos Busso, Murtaza Bulut, Chi-Chun Lee, Abe Kazemzadeh, Emily Mower, Samuel Kim, Jeannette N Chang, Sungbok Lee, and Shrikanth S Narayanan. *IEMOCAP: interactive emotional dyadic motion capture database*. Language Resources and Evaluation, vol. 42, no. 4, pp. 335, 2008.

2. For the **MSP-IMPROV dataset**, the citation is:
   > C Busso, S Parthasarathy, A Burmania, M AbdelWahab, N Sadoughi, and E M Provost. *MSP-IMPROV: An Acted Corpus of Dyadic Interactions to Study Emotion Perception*. IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, vol. 8, no. 1, pp. 67â€“80, 2017.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **IEMOCAP Dataset**: A dataset used for speech emotion recognition, containing improvised speech data with four emotion labels (happiness, sadness, anger, neutral).
- **MSP-IMPROV Dataset**: An acted corpus designed for studying emotion perception through dyadic interactions.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
