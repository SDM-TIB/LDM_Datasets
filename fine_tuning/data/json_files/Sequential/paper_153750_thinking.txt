To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Investigating Software Usage in the Social Sciences: A Knowledge Graph Approach" by David Schindler et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a knowledge graph (SoftwareKG) based on software mentions from over 51,000 scientific articles, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Document Selection and Corpus Generation)**, where the authors describe the creation of two corpora: the **Gold Standard Corpus (GSC)** and the **Silver Standard Corpus (SSC)**. 

1. **Gold Standard Corpus (GSC)**: This corpus was generated by selecting 500 articles from PLoS using the keyword "Social Science." It includes 480 articles with Methods & Materials sections, which were annotated for software mentions. The GSC is publicly available and contains 1,380 annotations.

2. **Silver Standard Corpus (SSC)**: This corpus was created using a distant and weak supervision approach, resulting in suggestive labels for software mentions. The SSC was used to train the model for software mention identification.

In the **results section**, the authors mention that they identified over 133,000 software mentions from the articles, which further confirms the existence of datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **Gold Standard Corpus (GSC)**, the citation is:
  > Schindler, D., Zapilko, B., & Kr√ºger, F. (2020). SoftwareKG (1.0). Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3715147

- For the **Silver Standard Corpus (SSC)**, while it does not have a separate citation, it is part of the methodology described in the paper and is derived from the GSC.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the key details and citations for each dataset. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work.
