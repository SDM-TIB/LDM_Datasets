To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Video Time: Properties, Encoders and Evaluation" by Amir Ghodrati, Efstratios Gavves, and Cees G. M. Snoek, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper evaluates video time through various tasks, which suggests that datasets will be discussed in detail.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Evaluating Video Time)**, where the authors describe three tasks related to video time. Each task is likely to have associated datasets. 

1. **Arrow of Time Prediction**: The authors mention two datasets:
   - **Pickup-Arrow**: This dataset contains 155 forward videos and 25 reverse videos, divided into three equal splits. The citation for this dataset is:
     > Lyndsey C Pickup, Zheng Pan, Donglai Wei, YiChang Shih, Changshui Zhang, Andrew Zisserman, Bernhard Scholkopf, and William T Freeman. *Seeing the arrow of time*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2014.
   - **UCF101-Arrow**: This is a modified version of the UCF101 dataset, used for action recognition but repurposed for the arrow of time task. The citation for the original UCF101 dataset is:
     > Khurram Soomro, Amir Roshan Zamir, and Mubarak Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.

2. **Future Frame Selection**: The authors focus on the **UCF24-FutureFrame** dataset, which is derived from UCF101. The citation for UCF101 is the same as above.

3. **Action Template Classification**: The authors refer to the **Something-Something dataset**, which is used for recognizing actions based on template-based descriptions. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Raghav Goyal, Samira Ebrahimi Kahou, Vincent Michalski, Joanna Materzynska, Susanne Westphal, Heuna Kim, Valentin Haenel, Ingo Freund, Peter Yianilos, Moritz Mueller-Freitag, et al. *The Something Something Video Database for Learning and Evaluating Visual Common Sense*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2017.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile the full citations accurately, as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that each dataset is clearly linked to its respective task and citation.
