To extract datasets from the research paper titled "vieCap4H Challenge 2021: Vietnamese Image Captioning for Healthcare Domain using Swin Transformer and Attention-based LSTM" by Thanh Tin Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the **vietCap4H dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look closely at the **introduction** where the authors discuss the **vieCap4H Challenge 2021**. They describe it as a competition for developing algorithms to generate captions for images in the healthcare domain, specifically related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This reinforces the importance of the **vietCap4H dataset**.

In the **methodology section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used. They mention that the challenge consists of two training datasets containing **8,032 images** and a validation dataset with **1,002 images**, along with a testing dataset of **1,032 images**. However, they primarily refer to the **vietCap4H dataset** throughout the paper.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **vietCap4H dataset**. The relevant citation is:

- For **vietCap4H dataset**, the citation is:
  > T. M. Le, L. H. Dang, T.-S. Nguyen, T. M. H. Nguyen, X.-S. Vu. *VLSP 2021 - vieCap4H Challenge: Automatic image caption generation for healthcare domain in Vietnamese*. In Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Vietnamese Language and Speech Processing, VNU Journal of Science: Computer Science and Communication Engineering, HCM, Vietnam, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the **vietCap4H dataset** using the required format, ensuring to include the full citation as it is crucial for proper attribution.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured.
