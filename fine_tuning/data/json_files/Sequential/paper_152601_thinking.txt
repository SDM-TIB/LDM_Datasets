To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sleep Arousal Detection from Polysomnography using the Scattering Transform and Recurrent Neural Networks" by Philip Warrick and Masun Nabhan Homsi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used the **PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2018 dataset** for their experiments, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the use of the **PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2018 dataset** again, confirming its importance in their study. They also describe the dataset as containing **13 PSG recordings**, which provides context about the dataset's structure.

In the **methods section**, specifically in **section 2.1 (Dataset Preparation Phase)**, the authors detail how they partitioned the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2018 dataset into training, validation, and test sets. This section reinforces the significance of the dataset in their methodology.

I will also check the **results section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors provide further details about the PhysioNet dataset's usage. However, it appears that the focus remains on the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2018 dataset throughout the paper.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2018 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2018 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ghassemi M M, Moody B E, Lehman L H, Song C, Li Q, Sun H, Mark R G, Westover M B, Clifford G D. *You Snooze, You Win: the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2018*. Computing in Cardiology Volume 45. Maastricht, Netherlands, 2018. 1-4.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about the dataset, including its citation, into the required format.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2018 dataset, ensuring that the citation is included accurately for proper referencing.
