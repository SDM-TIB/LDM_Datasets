To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the stability properties of Gated Recurrent Units neural networks" by Fabio Bonassi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets mentioned in the text, along with their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method is tested on a **Quadruple Tank nonlinear benchmark system**, which suggests that this system may be a dataset or a benchmark used in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe the Quadruple Tank benchmark system in detail, indicating that it is indeed a dataset used for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they collected data from the Quadruple Tank system, which consists of four tanks containing water, with levels h1, h2, h3, and h4. They describe the parameters and the control variables, which are subject to saturation. This detailed description confirms that the Quadruple Tank system is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Quadruple Tank benchmark system. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- For the **Quadruple Tank benchmark system**, the citation is:
  > I. Alvarado, et al., "A comparative analysis of distributed MPC techniques applied to the HD-MPC four-tank benchmark," *Journal of Process Control*, 21(5), pp. 800â€“815, 2011.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Quadruple Tank benchmark system**: This dataset is used to test the proposed method and is described in detail in the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that the citation is complete and correctly formatted for future reference.
