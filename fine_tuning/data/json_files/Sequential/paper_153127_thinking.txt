To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can Unconditional Language Models Recover Arbitrary Sentences?" by Nishant Subramani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experimental setup section** (Section 3) in detail. This section typically contains information about the datasets used for training and testing the models. In this case, the authors mention using the **English Gigaword** corpus for training their language models and the **IWSLT16 English to German translation dataset** for evaluating out-of-domain sentence recoverability.

Now, I will gather the necessary details for each dataset:

1. **English Gigaword**: The authors state that they trained their primary model on 50 million sentences from this corpus. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, and I need to find the full citation.

2. **IWSLT16 English to German translation dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the model's performance on out-of-domain sentences. I will also look for its full citation.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the complete citations for these datasets:

- For the **English Gigaword**, the citation is:
  > Graff, D., Kong, J., Chen, K., & Maeda, K. (2003). *English Gigaword*. Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia.

- For the **IWSLT16 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cettolo, M., Girgis, M., & Federico, M. (2016). *IWSLT 2016 Evaluation Campaign*. In Proceedings of the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as they are critical for proper attribution and reference.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured output that is ready for review or further processing.
