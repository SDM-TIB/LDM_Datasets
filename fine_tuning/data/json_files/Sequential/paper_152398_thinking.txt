To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Execute" by Wojciech Zaremba and Ilya Sutskever, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, which may hint at the types of datasets used. The introduction typically outlines the problem and may reference specific datasets or tasks.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In this paper, the authors describe their approach to training LSTMs on a specific class of programs, but they may also mention the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will pay close attention to any examples or descriptions of the data used in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for details on how the datasets were generated or collected. The authors mention using a specific algorithm to generate training cases, which suggests that the datasets are not standard public datasets but rather synthetically generated data. I will note the characteristics of this data, such as the types of programs and the parameters used for generation.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** for any citations related to the datasets. Since the datasets are generated by the authors, there may not be external citations, but I will still look for any relevant references that describe similar datasets or methodologies.

For the datasets identified, I will ensure to write down the full citation for the paper itself, as it is crucial to attribute the source of the datasets correctly. The citation for this paper is:
> Zaremba, Wojciech, and Ilya Sutskever. "Learning to Execute." Under review as a conference paper at ICLR, 2015.

Now, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Synthetic Program Dataset**: This dataset consists of programs generated using a specific algorithm described in the paper. The programs are designed to evaluate the LSTM's ability to execute simple Python-like code. The dataset includes various operations such as addition, subtraction, and conditional statements, and is parameterized by length and nesting.

2. **Addition Task Dataset**: This dataset is a subset of the synthetic programs specifically focused on addition tasks, where the LSTM is trained to add two numbers of the same length. The inputs are generated uniformly from a specified range.

3. **Memorization Task Dataset**: This dataset consists of sequences of digits that the LSTM must memorize and reproduce. The sequences vary in length, and the dataset is used to evaluate the LSTM's memory capabilities.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries along with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
