To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GTEA: Representation Learning for Temporal Interaction Graphs via Edge Aggregation" by Yiming Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "four large-scale real-world datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically the **Datasets** subsection. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments:

1. **Ethereum-Role Dataset**: This dataset is described as a multi-class role classification dataset based on the Ethereum Smart Contract network, containing 2,180,689 nodes and 3,745,858 edges. The authors mention that ground truth labels were collected from Etherscan.

2. **Ethereum Phishing Large Dataset**: This dataset is used for detecting phishing accounts in the Ethereum payment network, with 2,973,489 nodes and 5,355,155 edges. The dataset is referenced as being collected from Ethereum Phishing Datasets provided by Chen et al. (2019).

3. **Ethereum Phishing Small Dataset**: Similar to the large dataset, this one also focuses on phishing detection, containing 1,329,729 nodes and 2,161,573 edges. It is also sourced from the Ethereum Phishing Datasets by Chen et al. (2019).

4. **Mobile Payment Network Dataset**: This dataset is collected from a major mobile payment provider, consisting of 2,143,844 nodes and 21,326,122 edges. The authors describe how the graph is constructed based on user transactions.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **Ethereum-Role Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chen, L.; Peng, J.; Liu, Y.; Li, J.; Xie, F.; and Zheng, Z. 2019. XBLOCK Blockchain Datasets: InPlusLab Ethereum Phishing Detection Datasets. http://xblock.pro/ethereum/.

- For the **Ethereum Phishing Datasets**, the citation is the same as above since both the large and small datasets are derived from this source.

- The **Mobile Payment Network Dataset** does not have a specific citation in the references, but it is described in detail in the supplementary materials.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective sources.
