To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online Cyber-Attack Detection in Smart Grid: A Reinforcement Learning Approach" by Mehmet Necip Kurt et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the formulation of the online attack detection problem and mentions numerical studies, which may imply the use of datasets, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is typically where datasets are explicitly mentioned. In this paper, the authors describe their simulation setup and parameters in detail, which is crucial for identifying the datasets used.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors conducted simulations on an **IEEE-14 bus power system**. This is a well-known benchmark dataset in power systems research, and it is essential to note its significance in the context of the study.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the IEEE-14 bus power system dataset in the references section. The citation is as follows:
> R. Zimmerman, C. Murillo-Sánchez, and R. Thomas. "Matpower: Steady-state operations, planning, and analysis tools for power systems research and education." *IEEE Transactions on Power Systems*, vol. 26, no. 1, pp. 12–19, Feb 2011.

Additionally, the authors mention using various attack scenarios, such as **random FDI attacks** and **jamming attacks**, but these are not datasets in themselves; rather, they describe the types of attacks simulated within the context of the dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the IEEE-14 bus power system, ensuring to include the full citation as it is crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that it is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
