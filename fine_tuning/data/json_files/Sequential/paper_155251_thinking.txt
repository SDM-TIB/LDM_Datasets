To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Classification of Biomedical Articles in Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic" by Simon Lupart et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of **MedLine** and **LitCovid** datasets, which indicates that these are the primary datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental settings)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. In **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors provide specific information about the datasets:

1. **Medline/MeSH**: This dataset is described as the US National Library of Medical/Biomedical dataset, containing millions of biomedical scientific documents and built around the MeSH thesaurus. The authors mention that it includes about 30,000 MeSH descriptors and provides a hierarchy for semantic indexing.

2. **LitCovid**: This dataset is a subset of the Medline database, specifically focused on COVID-19 related articles. It contains 27,321 articles and is categorized into 8 classes. The authors note that it includes a subset of 9,000 COVID-19 related MeSH descriptors.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Medline**, the citation is:
  > Rogers, F. B. (1963). Medical subject headings. *Bulletin of the Medical Library Association*, 51, 114-116.

- For **LitCovid**, the citation is:
  > Chen, Q., Allot, A., & Lu, Z. (2020). LitCovid: an open database of COVID-19 literature. *Nucleic Acids Research*.

Now that I have the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, which is crucial for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent work.
