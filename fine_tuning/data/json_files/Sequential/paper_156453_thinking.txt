To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vision-Based Automatic Groceries Tracking System - Smart Homes" by Divya Mereddy, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the paper combines retail shelving data and a fruits dataset with real-time data collected from home groceries storage. This suggests that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will examine the **data sources section (IV)**, as it is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. In this section, the author mentions two specific datasets:

1. **Fruits 360 Dataset**: This dataset consists of images of various fruits and vegetables, specifically tailored for object detection tasks. It includes 131 classes of fruits and vegetables, with images sized at 100x100 pixels.

2. **SKU110k Dataset**: This dataset contains images of retail objects in a densely packed setting, providing training, validation, and test images along with corresponding bounding box information in CSV format.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For the **Fruits 360 Dataset**:
  > Oltean, Mihai. *Fruits 360 Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moltean/fruits?datasetId=5857&sortBy=relevance&sort=recent-comments

- For the **SKU110k Dataset**:
  > Goldman, Eran, et al. *SKU110K Dataset*. Available at: http://trax-geometry.s3.amazonaws.com/cvpr_challenge/SKU110K_fixed.tar.gz

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
