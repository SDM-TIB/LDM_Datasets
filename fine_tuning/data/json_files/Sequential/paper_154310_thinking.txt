To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Applying Occam’s Razor to Transformer-Based Dependency Parsing: What Works, What Doesn’t, and What is Really Necessary" by Stefan Grünewald et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on dependency parsing and mentions the use of Universal Dependencies (UD) corpora, which suggests that datasets related to UD are likely involved.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail their experimental setup. In this section, they mention evaluating their parser on **12 languages** using the **Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks**. This indicates that the datasets used are the UD treebanks for various languages.

I will look for a specific table or section that lists these datasets. In **Table 2**, the authors provide a list of languages along with their corresponding UD treebanks. The languages and their respective treebanks are as follows:

1. **Arabic**: PADT (Smrž et al., 2008)
2. **Chinese**: GSD
3. **Czech**: PDT (Bejček et al., 2012)
4. **English**: EWT (Silveira et al., 2014)
5. **Finnish**: TDT
6. **German**: GSD (McDonald et al., 2013)
7. **Hindi**: HDTB (Bhat et al.; Palmer et al., 2009)
8. **Italian**: ISDT
9. **Japanese**: Kaist (Chun et al., 2018)
10. **Korean**: LVTB
11. **Latvian**: SynTagRus (Droganova et al., 2018)
12. **Russian**: RuBERT (Kuratov and Arkhipov, 2019)

Now, I will ensure to retrieve the full citations for each of these datasets from the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **PADT**: Smrž, O., et al. (2008). *Prague Arabic Dependency Treebank: A word on the million words*. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Arabic and Local Languages (LREC 2008), pages 16–23, Marrakech, Morocco.

- **RuBERT**: Kuratov, Y., and Arkhipov, M. (2019). *Adaptation of deep bidirectional multilingual transformers for Russian language*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1905.07213.

For the remaining datasets (GSD, TDT, ISDT, Kaist, LVTB), I will need to look up their citations in the references section or through external sources if they are not explicitly mentioned in the paper.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
