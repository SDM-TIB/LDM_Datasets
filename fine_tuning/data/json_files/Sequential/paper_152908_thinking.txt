To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Open Intent Discovery for Conversational Text" by Nikhita Vedula et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors present a dataset of **25k real-life utterances** labeled via crowd sourcing, which suggests that this is a key dataset for their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the introduction, the authors mention the need for a dataset that reflects complex, real-world dialog scenarios, which reinforces the importance of the dataset they created.

In the **evaluation** section, the authors describe the dataset they curated from **Stack Exchange**, which consists of **25,000 questions** annotated for intents. They also provide details about the dataset's collection process, indicating that it spans various genres and has been curated for intents by crowd workers.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the Stack Exchange dataset they created, but they do reference the **Ubuntu Dialog Corpus** as a dataset they tested their model on. The citation for this dataset is:

- **Ubuntu Dialog Corpus**:
  > Ryan Lowe, Nissan Pow, Iulian Serban, and Joelle Pineau. *The ubuntu dialogue corpus: A large dataset for research in unstructured multi-turn dialogue systems*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.08909, 2015.

Since the main dataset they created (25k utterances) does not have a formal citation in the references, I will note that it is an original dataset created by the authors for their research.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **Stack Exchange Dataset**: A dataset of 25,000 real-life utterances labeled for intents, created by the authors through crowd sourcing.
2. **Ubuntu Dialog Corpus**: A dataset used for testing, which contains technical support conversations.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
