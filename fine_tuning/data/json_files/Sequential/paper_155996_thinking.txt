To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantum Circuit Fidelity Improvement with Long Short-Term Memory Networks" by Yikai Mao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets along with their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a system called Q-fid, which predicts the fidelity of quantum circuits. This suggests that datasets related to quantum circuits are likely discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to identify any specific datasets mentioned. The authors discuss the use of the QASMbench benchmark suite, which indicates that this is a dataset used for evaluation. I will note this down for further details.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation. The authors describe generating a dataset using the Randomized Benchmarking (RB) protocol, which is crucial for understanding the training data for their model. They mention that they created two datasets based on two IBM quantum processors: **ibm nairobi** and **ibmq montreal**. I will extract the details about these datasets, including their sizes and characteristics.

In the **results section**, I will confirm the datasets used in the experiments. The authors provide statistics about the datasets, including the number of circuits generated and the fidelity measurements. This information will help in accurately describing the datasets.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The citations are typically found in the **References section**. For the QASMbench benchmark suite, I will look for the original paper that describes it. The citation I find is:

- For **QASMbench**:
  > A. Li, S. Stein, S. Krishnamoorthy, and J. Ang. *Qasmbench: A low-level qasm benchmark suite for nisq evaluation and simulation*. 2020.

- For the datasets generated from the **Randomized Benchmarking (RB)** protocol, since they are derived from the authors' own methodology, I will note that they are not from a separate publication but are part of the experimental setup described in this paper.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted:

1. **QASMbench Dataset**: Used for evaluating the Q-fid system, providing a benchmark for quantum circuits.
2. **ibm nairobi Dataset**: Contains 82,644 circuits generated using the RB protocol.
3. **ibmq montreal Dataset**: Contains 91,386 circuits generated using the RB protocol.

With this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
