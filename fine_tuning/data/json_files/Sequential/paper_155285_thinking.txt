To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Domain Adversarial Spatial-Temporal Network: A Transferable Framework for Short-term Traffic Forecasting across Cities" by Ao Qu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on "three benchmark datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for validation. They mention three datasets: **PEMS04, PEMS07, and PEMS08**. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the experiments section, the authors provide information about the datasets:
1. **PEMS04**: Collected from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PEMS) every 30 seconds, containing traffic measurements such as speed, flow, and occupancy.
2. **PEMS07**: Similar to PEMS04, also collected from PEMS with the same frequency and types of measurements.
3. **PEMS08**: Again, collected from PEMS, maintaining the same data collection frequency and types.

The authors also mention that the traffic flow data from these datasets is aggregated to 5-minute intervals for forecasting purposes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the PEMS datasets are typically attributed to the California Department of Transportation, which manages the PEMS data.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:
- For **PEMS04**:
  > California Department of Transportation. 2021. Caltrans PeMS. https://pems.dot.ca.gov/.
  
- For **PEMS07**:
  > California Department of Transportation. 2021. Caltrans PeMS. https://pems.dot.ca.gov/.
  
- For **PEMS08**:
  > California Department of Transportation. 2021. Caltrans PeMS. https://pems.dot.ca.gov/.

Since all three datasets are sourced from the same platform, they share the same citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified and properly referenced.
