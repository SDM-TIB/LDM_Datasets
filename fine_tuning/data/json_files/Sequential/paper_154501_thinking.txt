To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Arabic aspect based sentiment analysis using bidirectional GRU based models" by Mohammed M. Abdelgwad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluated their models using a benchmarked Arabic hotel reviews dataset proposed by Pontiki et al. (2016). This indicates that a specific dataset is being used, and I need to gather more details about it.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Data and baseline research)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they specify that the dataset is the **Arabic hotel reviews dataset**, which was prepared as part of SemEval-2016 Task-5. The authors provide information about the dataset's size, distribution, and the number of annotated tuples, which is crucial for understanding its structure and application.

The paper states that the Arabic hotel reviews dataset contains **24,028 annotated ABSA tuples**, with **19,226 tuples for training** and **4,802 tuples for testing**. It also mentions that both text-level and sentence-level annotations were provided, which is important for anyone looking to use the dataset for similar tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The relevant citation for the Arabic hotel reviews dataset is:

- **Arabic hotel reviews dataset**:
  > Pontiki, M., Galanis, D., Papageorgiou, H., Androutsopoulos, I., Manandhar, S., Al-Smadi, M., Al-Ayyoub, M., Zhao, Y., Qin, B., De Clercq, O., et al. (2016). SemEval-2016 Task 5: Aspect based sentiment analysis. In Proceedings of the International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval), pp. 19â€“30.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and the full citation in the required format.

In summary, I will extract the following dataset from the paper:

1. **Arabic hotel reviews dataset**: A dataset containing 24,028 annotated ABSA tuples, used for evaluating aspect-based sentiment analysis models.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete.
