To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Interpreting Recurrent Neural Networks through Probabilistic Abstraction" by Jingyi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work but may not detail specific datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation)**, where the authors describe their experiments. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and testing the models. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as these often provide concise information about the dataset names, sizes, and characteristics.

In **Table 3**, the authors summarize the sizes of various datasets, including:

1. **Tomita Grammars**: An artificial dataset containing strings generated using different grammars.
2. **Balanced Parentheses (BP)**: An artificial dataset containing strings with balanced parentheses.
3. **Rotten Tomatoes Movie Review (RTMR)**: A dataset for sentiment analysis containing positive and negative movie reviews.
4. **IMDB**: A widely used benchmark dataset for sentiment analysis classification.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **Tomita Grammars**, the citation is:
  > Angluin, D. (1987). Learning regular sets from queries and counterexamples. *Information and Computation*, 75(2), 87-106.

- For **Balanced Parentheses**, the citation is:
  > Carrasco, R. C., & Oncina, J. (1994). Learning stochastic regular grammars by means of a state merging method. In *International Colloquium on Grammatical Inference* (pp. 139-152). Springer.

- For **Rotten Tomatoes Movie Review (RTMR)**, the citation is:
  > Pang, B., & Lee, L. (2005). Seeing stars: Exploiting class relationships for sentiment categorization with respect to rating scales. In *Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics* (pp. 115-124). Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **IMDB**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, X., Zhao, J., & LeCun, Y. (2015). Character-level convolutional networks for text classification. In *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems* (pp. 649-657).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This structured approach will help ensure that all relevant datasets are accurately documented and attributed.
