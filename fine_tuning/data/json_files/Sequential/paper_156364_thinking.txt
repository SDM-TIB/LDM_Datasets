To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Seq2seq is All You Need for Coreference Resolution" by Wenzheng Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on an array of datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **OntoNotes**: The authors provide a brief overview of this dataset, including its significance in coreference resolution tasks. They mention that it is a widely used dataset in the field.

2. **PreCo**: This dataset is also described, highlighting its large scale and relevance for preschool vocabulary tasks in coreference resolution.

3. **LitBank**: The authors note that this dataset is smaller and consists of annotated documents from English literature, which is relevant for their experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **OntoNotes**:
  > Pradhan, S., Moschitti, A., Xue, N., Uryupina, O., & Zhang, Y. (2012). CoNLL-2012 shared task: Modeling multilingual unrestricted coreference in OntoNotes. In Joint conference on EMNLP and CoNLL-shared task, pages 1–40.

- For **PreCo**:
  > Chen, H., Fan, Z., Lu, H., Yuille, A., & Rong, S. (2018). PreCo: A large-scale dataset in preschool vocabulary for coreference resolution. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 172–181, Brussels, Belgium. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **LitBank**:
  > Bamman, D., Lewke, O., & Mansoor, A. (2020). An annotated dataset of coreference in English literature. In Proceedings of the Twelfth Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pages 44–54, Marseille, France. European Language Resources Association.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
