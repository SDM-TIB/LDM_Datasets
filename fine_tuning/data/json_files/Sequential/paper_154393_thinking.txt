To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ALL FOR ONE AND ONE FOR ALL: IMPROVING MUSIC SEPARATION BY BRIDGING NETWORKS" by Ryosuke Sawata et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions improvements to music separation methods and references the use of Open-Unmix (UMX), which suggests that datasets related to music separation might be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they specifically mention the **MUSDB18 dataset**, which is crucial for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its composition and purpose.

In section 3.1, the authors describe the MUSDB18 dataset as comprising 150 songs recorded at a 44.1kHz sampling rate, with each song containing a mixture and its four sources (bass, drums, other, and vocals). This detailed description confirms that MUSDB18 is a significant dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MUSDB18 dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Z. Rafii, A. Liutkus, F.-R. St√∂ter, S. I. Mimilakis, and R. Bitner. "The MUSDB18 corpus for music separation." Dec. 2017.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about the MUSDB18 dataset, including its citation, into the required format.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details and citations before preparing the structured output for review or further processing.
