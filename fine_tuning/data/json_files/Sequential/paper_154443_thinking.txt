To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Domain Adaptation of NMT models for English-Hindi Machine Translation Task at AdapMT ICON 2020" by Ramchandra Joshi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses the use of a small in-domain parallel corpus for machine translation tasks, which suggests that specific datasets will be referenced.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset Details)**, where the authors provide explicit information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **IIT Bombay English-Hindi Parallel Corpus**: This dataset is mentioned as containing nearly 1.5 million training samples and is used for general machine translation tasks.

2. **AI In-Domain Parallel Corpus**: This dataset is specifically for the AI domain and contains 4872 training sentences, 400 validation sentences, and 401 test sentences.

3. **Chemistry In-Domain Parallel Corpus**: Similar to the AI corpus, this dataset contains 4984 training sentences, 300 validation sentences, and 397 test sentences.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citation for the IIT Bombay English-Hindi Parallel Corpus is:

- **IIT Bombay English-Hindi Parallel Corpus**:
  > Anoop Kunchukuttan, Pratik Mehta, and Pushpak Bhattacharyya. *The IIT Bombay English-Hindi Parallel Corpus*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.02855, 2017.

The AI and Chemistry in-domain datasets are provided by the AdapMT Shared Task ICON 2020 organizers, but they do not have specific citations listed in the references. Therefore, I will note that they are part of the shared task data.

Now, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation for the IIT Bombay dataset and mention the AI and Chemistry datasets as part of the shared task data.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset.
