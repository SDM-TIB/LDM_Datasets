To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attentive Temporal Pooling for Conformer-based Streaming Language Identification in Long-form Speech" by Quan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a novel language identification system and hints at the use of various datasets for training and evaluation. The introduction elaborates on the applications of language identification, which suggests that datasets are likely involved, especially since the authors mention analyzing streaming long-form audio.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and evaluation metrics)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **Anonymized voice queries from Google Assistant**: This dataset consists of voice queries that are anonymized for privacy and used to train the language identification model. The average length of these queries is about 3.3 seconds.

2. **Long-form utterances extracted from YouTube videos**: This dataset includes longer audio segments transcribed by human annotators, with an average length of about 20.7 minutes. The authors note that this dataset covers 61 languages.

In this section, the authors also provide details about the size of the training set for each language, which varies from 1M to 20M utterances, and the evaluation set, which consists of around 20K utterances for both voice queries and long-form speech.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from proprietary sources (Google Assistant and YouTube), they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets. Instead, I will note the context in which they are used:

- For **Anonymized voice queries from Google Assistant**, I will reference the Google AI Blog post that discusses the multilingual capabilities of Google Assistant, as it provides context for the dataset's origin.

- For **Long-form utterances extracted from YouTube videos**, I will reference the YouTube platform itself, noting that the data was transcribed by human annotators.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Anonymized voice queries from Google Assistant**: This dataset is used for training the language identification model and consists of anonymized voice queries with an average length of 3.3 seconds.

2. **Long-form utterances extracted from YouTube videos**: This dataset is used for evaluation and consists of long-form audio segments transcribed by human annotators, covering 61 languages.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the context and relevant citations for each dataset, ready for structured output or further processing.
