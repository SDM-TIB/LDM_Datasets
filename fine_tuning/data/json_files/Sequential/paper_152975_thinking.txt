To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End to End Recognition System for Recognizing Offline Unconstrained Vietnamese Handwriting" by Anh Duc Le et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on the **VNOnDB-Word** and **VNOnDB-Line** datasets, which suggests these are the primary datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly focusing on any sections that explicitly discuss datasets. In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they trained their model on the **VNOnDB database**, which is further detailed in the methodology. They describe how the VNOnDB database is collected from 200 writers and includes different levels of segmentation: **VNOnDB-Paragraph**, **VNOnDB-Line**, and **VNOnDB-Word**.

I will also check the **tables** that provide statistics about the datasets. For instance, **Table I** presents statistics for the **VNOnDB-Word** dataset, while **Table II** provides similar information for the **VNOnDB-Line** dataset. This confirms that both datasets are indeed used in their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**. The paper mentions the following:

1. **VNOnDB**: The authors refer to a paper by H. T. Nguyen et al. that discusses the Vietnamese Online Handwriting Database. The citation is:
   > H. T. Nguyen, C. T. Nguyen, P. T. Bao, and M. Nakagawa. *A database of unconstrained Vietnamese online handwriting and recognition experiments by recurrent neural networks*. Pattern Recognition, vol. 78, pp. 291–306, Jun. 2018.

2. **Unipen dataset**: The authors mention using the Unipen dataset in their experiments. The citation for this dataset is:
   > I. Guyon and L. Schomaker. *NIPEN project of on-line data exchange and recognizer benchmarks*. In Proceedings of the 12th IAPR International Conference on Pattern Recognition, Vol. 2, pp. 29–33.

3. **IRONOFF dataset**: The authors also refer to the IRONOFF dataset in their methodology. The citation is:
   > C. Viard-Gaudin, P. M. Lallican, S. Knerr, and P. Binter. *The IRESTE On/Off (IRONOFF) dual handwriting database*. In Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR '99), pp. 455–458, 1999.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
