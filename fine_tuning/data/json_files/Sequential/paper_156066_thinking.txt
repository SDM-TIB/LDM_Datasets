To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Physics-informed Convolutional Recurrent Surrogate Model for Reservoir Simulation with Well Controls" by Jungang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and case studies sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the model and its applications, but it may not specify datasets. The introduction may discuss prior work that could reference datasets used in the context of reservoir simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **case studies section** (section 4), as it often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for experiments. In this paper, the case studies include three scenarios: constant well control in a homogeneous reservoir, time-varying well control in a homogeneous reservoir, and time-varying well control in a heterogeneous reservoir. I will look for any specific datasets or simulation data mentioned in these case studies.

In the case studies, the author mentions using a Cartesian grid to discretize the reservoir domain and provides details about the physical properties of the reservoir, such as porosity, initial pressure, and viscosity. However, it appears that the paper does not reference any publicly available datasets but rather describes the simulation setup and parameters used for the experiments.

Since the paper states that the datasets and code will be available at a GitHub repository once published, I will note this as a potential source for the datasets. However, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets since they are not explicitly mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will check the **References section** to see if any prior works are cited that may have used datasets relevant to this research. If any of these references include datasets, I will extract their full citations.

In summary, I will:
1. Review the abstract, introduction, and case studies for mentions of datasets.
2. Identify any specific datasets or simulation data described in the case studies.
3. Note the GitHub repository for future access to datasets.
4. Check the references for any relevant datasets used in prior works.

Since the paper does not provide explicit datasets or citations, I will summarize my findings accordingly.
