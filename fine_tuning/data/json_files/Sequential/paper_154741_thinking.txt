To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Slower is Better: Revisiting the Forgetting Mechanism in LSTM for Slower Information Decay" by Hsiang-Yun Sherry Chien et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in subsections such as **4.1 (Copy Memory Task)**, **4.2 (Sequential MNIST)**, **4.3 (Character-Level Language Modeling)**, and **4.4 (IMDB Sentiment Classification)**. Each subsection usually contains detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In **section 4.1**, the authors describe the **Copy Memory Task**, which involves a synthetic dataset consisting of symbols. However, they do not provide a formal citation for this dataset since it is a constructed task rather than a publicly available dataset.

In **section 4.2**, the authors mention the **Sequential MNIST** and **Permuted MNIST** datasets. I will note the details provided about these datasets, including their structure and how they were used in the experiments.

In **section 4.3**, the authors refer to two language corpora: the **Penn Treebank Corpus (PTB)** and **Text8**. I will extract the relevant details about these datasets, including their significance in the context of the experiments.

In **section 4.4**, the authors discuss the **IMDB dataset**, which is used for sentiment classification. I will document the details provided about this dataset as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will look for include:

- For **Penn Treebank Corpus**:
  > Marcus, M. P., Santorini, B., and Marcinkiewicz, M. A. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2):313–330, 1993.

- For **Text8**:
  > Mahoney, M. *Text8 Dataset*. Available at: http://mattmahoney.net/dc/textdata.html.

- For **IMDB dataset**:
  > Maas, A. L., Daly, R. E., Pham, P. T., Huang, D., Ng, A. Y., and Potts, C. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In The 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 142–150, 2011.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information and citations, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and ease of use in future references or analyses.
