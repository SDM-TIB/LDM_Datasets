To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Grid Cells Are Ubiquitous in Neural Networks" by Songlin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, results, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on sections that typically contain detailed information about datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the role of grid cells in both spatial and non-spatial cognition tasks, hinting at the use of datasets for their experiments. They mention that their work involves the **CIFAR10** and **MNIST** datasets for non-spatial cognition tasks, which is a clear indication that these datasets are relevant.

Next, I will look into the **methods section**, where the authors describe how they generated their vision dataset and how they utilized the CIFAR10 and MNIST datasets. They mention that the MNIST dataset is used for image classification and that the CIFAR10 dataset is processed through a pre-trained network before being used in their experiments.

The **results section** confirms the use of these datasets, as the authors present findings related to the grid-like behavior observed in the models trained on these datasets.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The citations are typically found in the **references section**. Here are the citations I will extract:

1. **CIFAR10 Dataset**:
   > Krizhevsky, A. & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. (Citeseer).

2. **MNIST Dataset**:
   > LeCun, Y. & Cortes, C. (2010). MNIST handwritten digit database. (2010).

Additionally, the authors mention generating their own vision dataset using DeepMind's Lab environment. However, since they suggest that others generate their own dataset with their code, I will not include a citation for this dataset as it does not have a formal reference.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
