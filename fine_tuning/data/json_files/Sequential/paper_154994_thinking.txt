To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Soft Hierarchical Graph Recurrent Networks for Many-Agent Partially Observable Environments" by Zhenhui Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in prior work, which could be useful.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention four environments: **UAV-MBS**, **Surviving**, **Pursuit**, and **Cooperative Treasure Collection**. I will note down these names and look for detailed descriptions of each environment.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide descriptions of the environments:

1. **UAV-MBS**: This environment involves 20 UAVs serving as mobile base stations to provide communication services to ground users. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Ye, Z., Wang, K., Chen, Y., Jiang, X., & Song, G. (2021b). Multi-UAV Navigation for Partially Observable Communication Coverage by Graph Reinforcement Learning. TechRXiv:10.36227.

2. **Surviving**: This environment consists of 100 agents competing for a limited amount of food in a dynamic setting. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Jiang, J., Dun, C., Huang, T., & Lu, Z. (2019). Graph Convolutional Reinforcement Learning. In International Conference on Learning Representations.

3. **Pursuit**: This environment features 25 learnable predators and 50 pre-trained prey, where predators cooperate to capture prey. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Zheng, L., Yang, J., Cai, H., Zhou, M., Zhang, W., Wang, J., & Yu, Y. (2018). Magent: A many-agent reinforcement learning platform for artificial collective intelligence. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, volume 32.

4. **Cooperative Treasure Collection**: This environment involves three types of agents working together to collect treasures. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Iqbal, S., & Sha, F. (2019). Actor-Attention-Critic for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. In ICML.

After identifying these datasets and their descriptions, I will ensure to compile the full citations accurately, as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
