To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Robustness of Language Encoders against Grammatical Errors" by Fan Yin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected real grammatical errors from non-native speakers and used the NUS Corpus of Learner English (NUCLE) as a benchmark for grammatical error correction. This suggests that NUCLE is a key dataset.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. In section 3.1, the authors describe their approach to simulating grammatical errors and explicitly mention using the **NUCLE dataset**. They provide details about the dataset, including its size and the types of errors it contains.

In section 4, the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluating the robustness of language encoders. They mention four language understanding datasets:
1. **MRPC (Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus)**: A dataset for paraphrase detection.
2. **MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)**: A dataset for natural language inference tasks.
3. **QNLI (Question-answering NLI)**: A dataset derived from the Stanford Question Answering Dataset.
4. **SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)**: A sentiment analysis dataset.

Additionally, they mention using the **CoNLL-2003** dataset for Named Entity Recognition (NER).

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
