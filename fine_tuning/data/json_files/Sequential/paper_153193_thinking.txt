To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling Engagement Dynamics of Online Discussions using Relativistic Gravitational Theory" by Subhabrata Dutta et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **Reddit dataset**, which suggests that there are specific datasets used for their analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **section titled "Datasets"** (which is likely in the experimental setup or methodology section) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Reddit CMV Dataset**: This dataset contains 18,363 discussions from January 1, 2013, to May 7, 2015, for training, and 2,263 discussions from May 8, 2015, to September 1, 2015, for testing. It includes comments from 46,121 users in the training set and 6,044 users in the test set, totaling 1,011,890 comments in training and 112,432 comments in testing.

2. **Reddit r/news Community Dataset**: This dataset was collected from September 1, 2016, to January 16, 2019, consisting of 43,343 posts, out of which 5,449 posts did not have any comments. The authors ensured to balance the dataset by taking an equal number of posts containing comments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to these datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from Reddit, they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets. Instead, I will note the relevant details provided in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant citations or references provided in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary details.
