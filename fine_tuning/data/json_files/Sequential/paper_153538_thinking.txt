To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning-based Hybrid Graph-Coloring Algorithm for Register Allocation" by Dibyendu Das et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any mention of datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the parts that describe the training process and the types of graphs used. The authors mention using **random graphs generated via the very_nauty package** for training their model. This indicates that there is a dataset related to random graphs, which is crucial for understanding the training data.

I will also check the **experiments and results sections** to see if any specific datasets are used for testing the model's performance. The authors mention using **interference graphs generated by LLVM** and **popular graphs from literature**. I will need to identify these graphs and their sources.

In the **results section**, the authors provide tables summarizing the performance of their model on various graphs. I will extract the names of these graphs and any relevant details about their characteristics, such as the number of nodes and edges.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

1. **Random Graphs**: The authors used random graphs generated via the very_nauty package. The citation for this package is:
   > K. Briggs. The Very_Nauty Graph Library version 1.1, http://keithbriggs.info/very_nauty.html.

2. **SPEC CPU® 2017 Benchmarks**: The authors mention using interference graphs from SPEC CPU® 2017 benchmarks. The citation for this benchmark suite is:
   > SPEC. Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation, https://www.spec.org/cpu2017/.

3. **Popular Graphs from Literature**: The authors refer to several popular graphs, including the **Karate graph** and **Chvatal graph**. The citations for these graphs are:
   > Zachary Karate Club Network, http://networkrepository.com/soc-karate.php.
   > Wikipedia. Chvatal Graph, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chv%C3%A1tal_graph.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for understanding the context and validity of the findings.
