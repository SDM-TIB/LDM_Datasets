To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating Attribution Methods using White-Box LSTMs" by Yiding Hao, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of attribution methods using white-box networks, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where datasets are typically described. In this paper, the author mentions constructing four white-box LSTMs for testing attribution methods based on formal languages. I will look for any specific datasets used for these tasks.

Upon reviewing the **formal language tasks section**, I find that the paper defines several tasks based on formal languages, such as counting dependencies, long-distance dependencies, and hierarchical dependencies. However, it does not mention any external datasets; instead, it describes tasks that are likely generated or synthetically created for the purpose of the experiments.

Since the paper does not reference any established datasets, I will check the **appendices** for any additional information. The appendix provides detailed descriptions of the white-box networks but does not mention any datasets either.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to see if any of the cited works provide datasets that could be relevant. However, the references primarily consist of papers discussing methods and theories rather than datasets.

In conclusion, this paper does not utilize any external datasets but instead relies on synthetically generated tasks based on formal languages. Therefore, there are no dataset citations to extract. I will document this finding clearly, noting that the experiments are based on constructed tasks rather than established datasets.

Now, I will summarize my findings in a structured format for clarity:
- **No external datasets were used in the experiments.**
- **The tasks were synthetically generated based on formal languages.**
- **No citations for datasets are available in the references.**

This process highlights the importance of carefully reviewing each section of the paper to identify any datasets, even if they are not explicitly labeled as such. In this case, the absence of datasets is a significant finding in itself.
