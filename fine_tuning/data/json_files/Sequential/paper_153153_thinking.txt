To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Syntax-aware Neural Semantic Role Labeling" by Qingrong Xia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on the **CoNLL-2005 dataset**, which is a strong indicator that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The introduction discusses semantic role labeling (SRL) and references the CoNLL-2005 dataset as a benchmark for their experiments. This confirms that the CoNLL-2005 dataset is indeed used in their work.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide detailed statistics about the CoNLL-2005 dataset, including the number of sentences, tokens, predicates, and arguments. This section further solidifies the importance of the CoNLL-2005 dataset in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CoNLL-2005 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Carreras, X., and M`arquez, L. 2005. Introduction to the CoNLL-2005 shared task: Semantic role labeling. In Proceedings of CoNLL, 152â€“164.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the CoNLL-2005 dataset, I will create an entry for this dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
