To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequence Generation with Label Augmentation for Relation Extraction" by Bo Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "four RE datasets," which indicates that there are specific datasets that need to be identified.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention four datasets:

1. **TACRED**: A widely used dataset for relation extraction tasks, which includes a variety of relation types.
2. **SemEval2010**: Another established dataset for semantic relation classification, specifically for pairs of nominals.
3. **Google RE**: A dataset created by Google for relation extraction, which is also commonly referenced in the literature.
4. **sciERC**: A dataset focused on scientific entities and their relations, which is used to evaluate the model's performance in a domain-specific context.

To confirm the details of these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper for full citations. The citations for these datasets are as follows:

- For **TACRED**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, S., Ng, P., Wang, Z., & Xiang, B. (2017). Position-aware Attention and Supervised Data Improve Slot Filling. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 2248–2255.

- For **SemEval2010**, the citation is:
  > Hendrickx, I., Kim, S. N., Kozareva, Z., Nakov, P., Séaghdha, D. Ó., Padó, S., Pennacchiotti, M., Romano, L., & Szpakowicz, S. (2010). SemEval-2010 Task 8: Multi-Way Classification of Semantic Relations between Pairs of Nominals. In SemEval@ACL 2010.

- For **Google RE**, the citation is:
  > Google Research. (n.d.). Google Relation Extraction Dataset. Retrieved from https://github.com/google-research-datasets/relation-extraction-corpus.

- For **sciERC**, the citation is:
  > Luan, Y., He, L., Ostendorf, M., & Hajishirzi, H. (2018). Multi-Task Identification of Entities, Relations, and Coreference for Scientific Knowledge Graph Construction. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1–10.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their full citations.
