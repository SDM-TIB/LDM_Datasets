To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Few-shot Approach to Resume Information Extraction via Prompts" by Chengguang Gan and Tatsunori Mori, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on resume information extraction, but I need to look for specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention leveraging a "seven-category sentence classification of English resume data" and refer to a dataset extracted from "15,000 original resumes," with "1000 of them used as tagged objects." This indicates that there is a dataset related to resumes, but I need to find more details.

Next, I will check **section 3 (Task Setup)**, where the authors provide more specific information about the dataset. They state that the dataset consists of "78786" total sentence samples and "1000" annotated resumes. This section confirms the existence of a dataset used for their experiments.

The authors also provide a link to the dataset: "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oo7kartik/resume-text-batch." This is crucial for citing the dataset properly.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference their own work regarding the construction of the English resume corpus, which is essential for proper citation.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Gan, C., & Mori, T. (2022). Construction of English resume corpus and test with pre-trained language models. arXiv preprint arXiv:2208.03219.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Resume Dataset**: This dataset consists of 15,000 original resumes, with 1,000 of them annotated for the purpose of training and testing the model. It contains a total of 78,786 sentence samples, making it suitable for few-shot learning tasks in resume information extraction.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing or review.
