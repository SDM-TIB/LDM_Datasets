To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequence-level self-learning with multiple hypotheses" by Kenichi Kumatani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on an accent adaptation task and a federated learning scenario, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (ASR experiment)**, where the authors describe their experiments in detail. In **subsection 4.1 (Accent Adaptation Task)**, they mention using the **British Cortana corpus** as a test set, which consists of 14,000 utterances spoken by hundreds of users. This indicates that the British Cortana corpus is a dataset used in their experiments.

In **subsection 4.2 (Librispeech Task)**, the authors refer to the **Librispeech (LS) dataset**, which contains approximately 1000 hours of read speech for training. This dataset is also crucial for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **British Cortana corpus**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is mentioned in the context of the adaptation task. I will note that it is a dataset used for testing in their experiments.

- For the **Librispeech dataset**, the citation is:
  > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. "Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books." In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 5206â€“5210, 2015.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. 

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **British Cortana corpus** - used for accent adaptation tasks (citation not explicitly provided).
2. **Librispeech dataset** - used for ASR experiments, with a full citation available.

I will ensure that the dataset entries are clear and include the necessary citations for future reference.
