To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating Lode Runner Levels by Learning Player Paths with LSTMs" by Kynan Sorochan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions extracting player path data from gameplay video, which suggests that there is a dataset related to gameplay videos.

Next, I will look closely at the **methodology** section, particularly **section 3 (System Overview)** and its subsections, especially **3.1 (Data extraction)**. Here, the authors describe how they extracted player paths from gameplay videos. They mention downloading videos from YouTube and extracting frames to track player movements, which indicates that the dataset consists of gameplay videos used for path extraction.

In **section 3.1**, the authors specify that they extracted 66 player paths for 66 game levels from a 4.5-hour long gameplay video. This is a clear indication of a dataset derived from gameplay videos.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference prior work that involves extracting player paths from gameplay videos, but they do not provide a specific citation for the dataset they created. However, they mention using gameplay videos from YouTube, which may not have a formal citation.

To summarize the datasets identified:
1. **Player Path Dataset**: This dataset consists of 66 player paths extracted from gameplay videos of Lode Runner. The paths were derived from a 4.5-hour long gameplay video sourced from YouTube.

Since there is no formal citation for the YouTube videos used, I will note that the dataset is based on publicly available gameplay videos, but I cannot provide a specific citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I include the relevant details about the dataset and its source.
