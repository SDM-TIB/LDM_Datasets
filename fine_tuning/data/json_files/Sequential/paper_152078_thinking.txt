To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Reranking for Named Entity Recognition" by Jie Yang, Yue Zhang, and Fei Dong, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses a neural reranking system for named entity recognition (NER) but does not specify any datasets. The introduction provides context about NER but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically described. In **Section 4.1 (Settings)**, the authors mention that they evaluate their methods on the **CoNLL 2003 English dataset**. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, and I will need to gather more details about it.

In **Section 4.2 (Reranking Data)**, the authors provide additional information about the CoNLL 2003 dataset, stating that it includes 14,987 training sentences, 3,466 development sentences, and 3,684 test sentences, annotated into four entity types: persons (PER), locations (LOC), organizations (ORG), and miscellaneous (MISC). This confirms that the CoNLL 2003 dataset is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the CoNLL 2003 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Erik F Tjong Kim Sang and Fien De Meulder. *Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 shared task: Language-independent named entity recognition*. In Proceedings of the seventh conference on Natural language learning at HLT-NAACL 2003-Volume 4, pages 142â€“147.

Since the CoNLL 2003 dataset is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

I will create an entry for the CoNLL 2003 dataset, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise dataset entry ready for further use or analysis.
