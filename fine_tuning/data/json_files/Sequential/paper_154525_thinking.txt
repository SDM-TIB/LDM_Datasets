To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Benchmarking of eight recurrent neural network variants for breath phase and adventitious sound detection on a self-developed open-access lung sound databaseâ€”HF_Lung_V1" by Fu-Shun Hsu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates the creation of a lung sound database (HF_Lung_V1) with specific details about its contents, which suggests that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Establishment of the lung sound database)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the HF_Lung_V1 database comprises **9,765 audio files of lung sounds**, along with various labels for inhalation, exhalation, and adventitious sounds. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset's structure and contents.

In **section 2.1 (Data sources and patients)**, the authors explain the sources of the data used to create the HF_Lung_V1 database, including recordings from a datathon and a respiratory care ward. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and validity.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the HF_Lung_V1 dataset. The authors provide a link to the dataset, which is hosted on GitLab, and mention that it is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC BY 4.0). The citation for the dataset is as follows:
> Hsu, F.-S., Huang, S.-R., Cheng, Y.-R., et al. (2023). *HF_Lung_V1: An open-access lung sound database for breath phase and adventitious sound detection*. Available at: https://gitlab.com/techsupportHF/HF_Lung_V1.

Now, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **HF_Lung_V1 Database**: Contains 9,765 audio files of lung sounds, with labels for inhalation (34,095), exhalation (18,349), continuous adventitious sounds (CAS) (13,883), and discontinuous adventitious sounds (DAS) (15,606).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset entry has a clear description and citation, as it is essential for proper attribution and reference in future work.
