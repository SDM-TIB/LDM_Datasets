To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepWriting: Making Digital Ink Editable via Deep Generative Modeling" by Emre Aksan, Fabrizio Pece, and Otmar Hilliges, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors contribute a new dataset of handwritten text with fine-grained annotations at the character level. This suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **results** sections, particularly focusing on the **Datasets** subsection, which is likely to provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. In this paper, the authors mention that they accumulate the IAM On-Line Handwriting Database (IAM-OnDB) with newly collected samples, resulting in a unified dataset containing data from 294 unique authors.

In the **Datasets** section, I will note the following details:

1. **Unified Handwriting Dataset**: This dataset includes handwritten text collected from 294 authors, with a total of 85,181 word instances and 406,956 handwritten characters. The dataset is characterized by fine-grained annotations at the character level, which is crucial for their model's training.

2. **IAM On-Line Handwriting Database (IAM-OnDB)**: This is a well-known dataset that the authors reference as part of their unified dataset. It contains handwritten text captured with low-resolution and low-accuracy digital whiteboard, and it includes annotations at the sequence level.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **IAM On-Line Handwriting Database (IAM-OnDB)**, the citation is:
  > Marcus Liwicki and Horst Bunke. *IAM-OnDB: An On-Line English Sentence Database Acquired from Handwritten Text on a Whiteboard*. In Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), pages 956â€“961, 2005.

- For the **newly collected dataset**, since it is a contribution of the authors themselves, I will cite it as follows:
  > Emre Aksan, Fabrizio Pece, and Otmar Hilliges. *DeepWriting: Making Digital Ink Editable via Deep Generative Modeling*. In Proceedings of the CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI), pages 1-14, 2018.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
