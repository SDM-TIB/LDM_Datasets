To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Compose Representations of Different Encoder Layers towards Improving Compositional Generalization" by Lei Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention the datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks that the authors have used to validate their approach. This section often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will look for specific names and descriptions of datasets, including any details about their structure, size, and purpose.

In this paper, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **CoGnition**: This dataset is described as a realistic English to Chinese translation dataset, consisting of a training set of 196,246 sentence pairs, a validation set, and a test set of 10,000 samples. It also includes a synthetic test set for evaluating compositional generalization.

2. **CFQ (Compositional Freebase Questions)**: This dataset is automatically generated from a set of rules and is designed to track which rules and combinations are present in each example. It consists of three splits with maximum compound divergence, with a training set of 95,743 examples, a validation set, and a test set of 11,968 examples.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For **CoGnition**, the citation is:
> Li, Y., Zheng, H., & Lapata, M. (2021). On compositional generalization of neural machine translation. In Proceedings of the 59th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 11th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 1: Long Papers). Association for Computational Linguistics.

For **CFQ**, the citation is:
> Keysers, D., Sch√§rli, N., Scales, N., Buisman, H., Furrer, D., Kashubin, S., Momchev, N., Wang, X., van Zee, M., & Bousquet, O. (2020). Measuring compositional generalization: A comprehensive method on realistic data. In 8th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2020.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
