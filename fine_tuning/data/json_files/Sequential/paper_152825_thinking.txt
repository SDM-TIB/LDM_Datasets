To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning Based Motion Planning For Autonomous Vehicle Using Spatiotemporal LSTM Network" by Zhengwei Bai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, specifically section III, the authors mention using the **Comma-dataset**. This dataset is described as consisting of over 80GB of raw image data and vehicle state data collected from vehicle-based sensors. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized for the experiments.

Next, I will look for any additional details about the dataset in the text. The authors provide information about the data collected, including the types of data (images and vehicle states) and the specifications (image resolution and frequency of capture). This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Comma-dataset. The citation is provided as follows:
> Comma.ai, “Comma-dataset,” https://github.com/commaai/research.

Since this is a dataset from a GitHub repository, I will ensure to include the URL in the citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and the full citation.

In summary, the steps I followed include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Focusing on the experiments section for detailed descriptions of the datasets used.
3. Collecting full citations from the references section to ensure proper attribution.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry based on the information collected.
