To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sentylic at IEST 2018: Gated Recurrent Neural Network and Capsule Network Based Approach for Implicit Emotion Detection" by Prabod Rathnayaka et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, experiments, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the task and the model used, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the Implicit Emotion Recognition Shared Task but does not specify a dataset name. However, it does reference the work of Klinger et al. (2018), which may lead to the identification of the dataset used.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any details about the data used for training and testing the model. The authors mention using pre-trained Word2Vec embeddings, but they do not specify the dataset from which the tweets are drawn.

Moving to the **experiments section**, I will check for any mention of datasets used in the experiments. The authors refer to the WASSA 2018 Implicit Emotion Shared Task, which indicates that the dataset is likely related to this task. However, I need to confirm the exact dataset name.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find any citations related to the dataset. The authors reference Klinger et al. (2018), which is crucial for identifying the dataset used in their experiments. 

The citation for the dataset used in the WASSA 2018 Implicit Emotion Shared Task is:
> Klinger, R., de Clercq, O., Mohammad, S. M., & Balahur, A. (2018). IEST: WASSA-2018 implicit emotions shared task. In Proceedings of the 9th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis, Brussels, Belgium. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset used in the research paper. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset utilized in the study.
