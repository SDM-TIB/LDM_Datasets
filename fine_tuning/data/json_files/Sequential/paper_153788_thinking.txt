To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TSception: A Deep Learning Framework for Emotion Detection Using EEG" by Yi Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that EEG data were collected from 18 healthy subjects, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** section, particularly the **Data Acquisition** subsection, where the authors describe how they collected EEG data. They mention that EEG data were collected from 18 healthy subjects using a VR-BCI system, specifically noting the channels used (TP9, AF7, AF8, TP10) and the sampling rate (256 Hz). This information is crucial for defining the dataset.

In the **experiments** section, the authors provide details about the stimuli used to induce emotional arousal, which further contextualizes the dataset. They describe two types of stimuli: low arousal and high arousal, and the experimental setup, which includes the number of subjects and the duration of each stimulus.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the paper does not reference an external dataset but rather describes the data collected during their own experiments. Therefore, I will create a citation for the dataset based on the information provided in the paper.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **EEG Dataset for Emotion Detection**: This dataset consists of EEG data collected from 18 healthy subjects (9 males and 9 females, aged 23-49) using a VR-BCI system. The data includes recordings from four EEG channels (TP9, AF7, AF8, TP10) at a sampling rate of 256 Hz. The dataset is designed to study emotional arousal in an immersive virtual reality environment, with stimuli inducing low and high emotional arousal.

The citation for this dataset, based on the authors and the context of the study, would be:
> Yi Ding, Neethu Robinson, Qiuhao Zeng, Duo Chen, Aung Aung Phyo Wai, Tih-Shih Lee, and Cuntai Guan. *TSception: A Deep Learning Framework for Emotion Detection Using EEG*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC), 2020.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
