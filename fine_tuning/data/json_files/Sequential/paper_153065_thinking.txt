To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lattice Transformer for Speech Translation" by Pei Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **LDC Spanish-English speech translation corpus**, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.1 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They refer to two specific datasets:

1. **Fisher Spanish-English Speech Translation Corpus**: This dataset is produced from telephone conversations and includes a significant number of sentence pairs. The authors mention that it contains 138,819 sentence pairs.

2. **Callhome Spanish-English Speech Translation Corpus**: This dataset is primarily composed of conversations between friends and family members, with 15,080 sentence pairs.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of these datasets:

- For the **Fisher Spanish-English Speech Translation Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Post, M., Kumar, G., Lopez, A., Karakos, D., Callison-Burch, C., & Khudanpur, S. (2013). Improved speech-to-text translation with the Fisher and Callhome Spanishâ€“English speech translation corpus. In *International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation*.

- For the **Callhome Spanish-English Speech Translation Corpus**, the citation is included in the same reference as the Fisher corpus, as they are both part of the same study.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both datasets as required.

After gathering all necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or processing.
