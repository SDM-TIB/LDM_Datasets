To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Speech Representation Learning Using WaveNet Autoencoders" by Jan Chorowski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of **LibriSpeech** and **ZeroSpeech 2017** datasets, which indicates that these are the datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section IV, the authors explicitly state that they evaluated their models on two datasets:

1. **LibriSpeech**: This dataset is described as a corpus of clean, read speech sourced from audiobooks, recorded at a sampling rate of 16 kHz. The authors refer to the clean subset of this dataset.

2. **ZeroSpeech 2017**: This dataset is used for the acoustic unit discovery task and is mentioned as having controlled amounts of per-speaker data, with the majority of the data being uttered by only a few speakers.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of these datasets:

- For **LibriSpeech**, the citation is:
  > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *LibriSpeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206â€“5210, 2015.

- For **ZeroSpeech 2017**, the citation is:
  > E. Dunbar, X. N. Cao, J. Benjumea, J. Karadayi, M. Bernard, L. Besacier, X. Anguera, and E. Dupoux. *The zero resource speech challenge 2017*. In Proceedings of the Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding Workshop (ASRU), 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research along with their proper citations.
