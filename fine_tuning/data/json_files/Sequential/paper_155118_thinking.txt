To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Paradigm Shift in Language Modeling: Revisiting CNN for Modeling Sanskrit Originated Bengali and Hindi Language" by Chowdhury Rafeed Rahman et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors have conducted experiments on multiple real-world datasets, which suggests that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide specific details about the datasets used. They mention two main datasets for Bengali and Hindi:

1. **Bengali Dataset**: This dataset consists of articles from various online public news portals, including Prothom-Alo, BDNews24, and Nayadiganta. The authors specify that the articles cover diverse domains such as politics, entertainment, and technology.

2. **Hindi Dataset**: This dataset includes articles from Hindinews, Livehindustan, and Patrika, also covering similar domains. The authors clarify that Nayadiganta and Patrika datasets are used as independent test sets.

In this section, the authors also mention that they created a new version of the Bengali dataset by incorporating spelling errors using a probabilistic error generation algorithm. This detail is crucial as it indicates the dataset's adaptability for testing language models under erroneous conditions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

  > Jain, B. (2018). Patrika. Retrieved from https://epaper.patrika.com/

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
