To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Solar Flares Using a Long Short-Term Memory Network" by Hao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors utilize data from the **GOES X-ray flare catalogs** and **Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP)**, which indicates that these are potential datasets of interest.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (Data and Predictive Parameters)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their study. Here, they mention two key data sources:

1. **Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP)**: This dataset is produced by the SDO/HMI team and includes various physical parameters suitable for flare prediction. The authors reference the original paper that describes this dataset, which is crucial for citation purposes.

2. **GOES X-ray flare catalogs**: The authors state that they surveyed flare events from May 2010 to May 2018 using this catalog, which is maintained by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). This dataset is also essential for citation.

I will then check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **SHARP dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bobra, M. G., Sun, X., Hoeksema, J. T., et al. (2014). *The Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP) data series*. Solar Physics, 289(3549), doi:10.1007/s11207-014-0529-3.

- For the **GOES X-ray flare catalogs**, the citation is:
  > NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). *GOES X-ray flare catalogs*. Available at: https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/stp/solar/flare.html.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described clearly and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
