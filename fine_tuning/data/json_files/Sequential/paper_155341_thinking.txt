To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multiple Inputs Neural Networks for Medicare Fraud Detection" by Mansour Zoubeirou A Mayaki and Michel Riveill, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information and provide full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study uses data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which suggests that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on the **Data sets** section (section 3), where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they mention that they use publicly available Medicare datasets from CMS for the period 2017–2019. They specify that the datasets include:

1. **Inpatient Data**: This dataset contains information on hospitalization requests, including details such as patient identifiers, claim identifiers, admission and discharge dates, and reimbursement amounts.

2. **Outpatient Data**: This dataset includes information on outpatient care requests, similar to the inpatient data, with relevant identifiers and reimbursement details.

3. **Beneficiary Information**: This dataset provides details about the beneficiaries, including identifiers and other relevant attributes.

Additionally, the authors mention using the **Office of Inspector General’s List of Excluded Individuals and Entities (LEIE)**, which contains information about healthcare providers excluded from the healthcare system due to fraudulent activities.

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)** data, the citation is:
  > US and Government. Centers for Medicare, Medicaid Services. *Medicare Fee-for-Service Provider Utilization, Payment Data Physician and Other Supplier Public Use File: A Methodological Overview*, 2018.

- For the **Office of Inspector General’s List of Excluded Individuals and Entities (LEIE)**, the citation is:
  > US and Government. Office of Inspector General. *List of Excluded Individuals and Entities*, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its corresponding citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
