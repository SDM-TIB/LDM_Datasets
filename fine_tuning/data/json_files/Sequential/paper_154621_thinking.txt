To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AfriKI: Machine-in-the-Loop Afrikaans Poetry Generation" by Imke van Heerden and Anil Bas, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the generative language model AfriKI and its application in poetry generation, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Model)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for training the model. Here, the authors mention that the AfriKI model was trained on a literary novel titled "Die Biblioteek aan die Einde van die Wêreld" by Etienne van Heerden. This is a crucial dataset for the study.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **future work** section, where the authors reference the potential incorporation of other Afrikaans datasets, specifically the **NCHLT Annotated Text Corpora** and the **Afrikaans treebank**. This indicates that these datasets are relevant to the research context, even if they were not used directly in the current study.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the identified datasets:

1. **Die Biblioteek aan die Einde van die Wêreld**:
   > Van Heerden, Etienne. *Die Biblioteek aan die Einde van die Wêreld*. NB-Uitgewers, 2019.

2. **NCHLT Annotated Text Corpora**:
   > Eiselen, Roald, and Martin Puttkammer. "Developing text resources for ten South African languages." In Proceedings of the LREC, pages 3698–3703, 2014.

3. **Afrikaans Treebank**:
   > Augustinus, Liesbeth, Peter Dirix, Daniel Van Niekerk, Ineke Schuurman, Vincent Vandeghinste, Frank Van Eynde, and Gerhard Van Huyssteen. "AfriBooms: An online treebank for Afrikaans." In Proceedings of the LREC, pages 677–682, 2016.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described, including its purpose and relevance to the research. Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all citations are accurate and complete for future reference or processing.
