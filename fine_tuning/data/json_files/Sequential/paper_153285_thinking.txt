To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Highly Efficient SMILES Explorer Using Autodidactic Generative Examination Networks" by Igor V. Tetko et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "canonical SMILES" and "PubChem," which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the exploration of chemical space and mention three databases: **GDB11, GDB13, and GDB17**. This indicates that these datasets are relevant to their research.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly where the authors describe the preparation of datasets. They specifically mention downloading the **PubChem database** in March 2019 and extracting canonical SMILES strings. This section provides details about the dataset preparation, including the filtering of organic molecules and deduplication to create a unique set of SMILES.

The authors also refer to the **Chembl24** and **Zinc15** datasets in the methods section, indicating that these datasets were used for training and evaluation purposes. They describe how these datasets were processed similarly to the PubChem dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors analyze the performance of their models using the datasets mentioned earlier, confirming their relevance and application in the study.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **references section**:

1. **PubChem**:
   > Kim S, Chen J, Cheng T, et al. (2019). PubChem 2019 update: improved access to chemical data. *Nucleic Acids Res*, 47:D1102–D1109.

2. **GDB11**:
   > Reymond J-L, van Deursen R, Blum LC, Ruddigkeit L. (2010). Chemical space as a source for new drugs. *MedChemComm*, 1:30.

3. **GDB13**:
   > Reymond J-L. (2015). The chemical space project. *Acc Chem Res*, 48:722–730.

4. **GDB17**:
   > Reymond J-L. (2015). The chemical space project. *Acc Chem Res*, 48:722–730. (Note: GDB17 is part of the same reference as GDB13).

5. **Chembl24**:
   > Gaulton A, Hersey A, Nowotka M, et al. (2017). The ChEMBL Database in 2017. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 45(D1):D945–D954.

6. **Zinc15**:
   > Sterling T, Irwin JJ. (2015). ZINC 15--Ligand Discovery for Everyone. *Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling*, 55(11):2324–37.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations for future use or analysis.
