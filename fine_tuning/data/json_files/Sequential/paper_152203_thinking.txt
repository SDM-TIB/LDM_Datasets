To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-to-End Visual Speech Recognition with LSTMs" by Stavros Petridis, Zuwei Li, and Maja Pantic, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors report improvements on two databases, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Databases)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **OuluVS2 Database**: This dataset contains 52 speakers saying 10 utterances, with a total of 156 examples per utterance. The authors provide details about the mouth regions of interest (ROIs) and how they are processed.

2. **CUAVE Database**: This dataset includes 36 subjects speaking digits 0 to 9, with 180 examples per digit. The authors describe the tracking of facial points and the extraction of mouth ROIs.

Both datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper, and their descriptions provide insights into their structure and usage.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **OuluVS2 Database**, the citation is:
  > I. Anina, Z. Zhou, G. Zhao, and M. Pietikinen. *Ouluvs2: A multi-view audiovisual database for non-rigid mouth motion analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG), 2015.

- For the **CUAVE Database**, the citation is:
  > E. Patterson, S. Gurbuz, Z. Tufekci, and J. Gowdy. *Moving-talker, speaker-independent feature study, and baseline results using the cuave multimodal speech corpus*. EURASIP Journal on Applied Signal Processing, vol. 2002, no. 1, pp. 1189â€“1201, Jan. 2002.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its respective citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for further processing or review.
