To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ELI5: Long Form Question Answering" by Angela Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a large-scale corpus for long-form question answering, specifically the ELI5 dataset, which is a strong indication that this is the primary dataset discussed in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe the ELI5 dataset in detail, including its size (270K threads from the Reddit forum "Explain Like I’m Five") and the nature of the questions and answers it contains. This section will provide essential details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **related work** section to see if other datasets are mentioned in comparison to ELI5. The authors reference several other datasets, such as MS MARCO, TriviaQA, NarrativeQA, CoQA, and SQuAD, which are relevant to the context of long-form question answering.

In the **experiments** section, the authors discuss how they benchmark their models against these datasets, confirming their relevance and providing additional context for their use.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The citations are typically found in the **references section**. Here are the datasets I will include:

1. **ELI5 Dataset**:

5. **CoQA**:
   - Citation:

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, which is crucial for any further analysis or research.
