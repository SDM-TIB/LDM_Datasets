To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transfer NAS: Knowledge Transfer between Search Spaces with Transformer Agents" by ZalÃ¡n Borsos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a novel agent for Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and hints at the evaluation on specific benchmarks, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. In this section, the authors discuss various NAS methods but do not specify any datasets yet. I will continue to the **methods section**, where they describe their approach and may reference datasets used for training or evaluation.

In the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.2**, the authors mention the **NAS-Bench-101** dataset, which is a public architecture search benchmark. They describe it as allowing testing of NAS agents on the task of designing a CNN cell. This is a clear identification of a dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the NAS-Bench-101 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **NAS-Bench-101**, the citation is:
  > Chris Ying, Aaron Klein, Esteban Real, Eric Christiansen, Kevin Murphy, and Frank Hutter. *NAS-Bench-101: Towards Reproducible Neural Architecture Search*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.09635, 2019.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for NAS-Bench-101, ensuring it is ready for any further processing or review.
