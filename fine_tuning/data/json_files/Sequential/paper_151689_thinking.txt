To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Free-Form Image Inpainting with Gated Convolution" by Jiahui Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed system achieves higher-quality inpainting results on benchmark datasets, which indicates that specific datasets are likely referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors discuss their results on benchmark datasets, specifically mentioning **Places2** and **CelebA-HQ** in the context of evaluating their inpainting system.

I will then gather detailed descriptions of these datasets from the relevant sections. For **Places2**, the authors indicate that it is a large-scale dataset for scene recognition, while **CelebA-HQ** is a high-quality dataset for face images. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations I need to extract are:

1. For **Places2**:
   > Bolei Zhou, Agata Lapedriza, Aditya Khosla, Aude Oliva, and Antonio Torralba. *Places: A 10 million image database for scene recognition*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2017.

2. For **CelebA-HQ**:
   > Tero Karras, Timo Aila, Samuli Laine, and Jaakko Lehtinen. *Progressive growing of gans for improved quality, stability, and variation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.10196, 2017.

After confirming the details and citations, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, ensuring that I maintain the integrity of the information presented.
