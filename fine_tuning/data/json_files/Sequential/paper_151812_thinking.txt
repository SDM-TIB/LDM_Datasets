To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DR-BiLSTM: Dependent Reading Bidirectional LSTM for Natural Language Inference" by Reza Ghaeini et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors demonstrate their model's effectiveness on the **Stanford NLI dataset**, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments and Evaluation)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention the **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset**, describing it as containing 570K human-annotated sentence pairs, with premises drawn from the Flickr30k corpus.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SNLI dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for natural language inference*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, EMNLP 2015, Lisbon, Portugal, September 17-21, 2015, pages 632â€“642. http://aclweb.org/anthology/D/D15/D15-1075.pdf.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the SNLI dataset, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the necessary details, including the full citation, and prepare it for structured output. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant information regarding the dataset used in the research paper.
