To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reverse Ordering Techniques for Attention-Based Channel Prediction" by Valentina Rizzello et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss the methodology and experiments** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals, but I will need to look deeper into the paper for specific dataset details.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Simulations)**, as it is likely to contain information about the datasets used for the simulations. In this section, the authors mention that they generated **150,000 CSI sequences** corresponding to **1,500 different velocities** using **QuaDRiGa v.2.6**. This indicates that QuaDRiGa is a dataset or simulation tool used in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for QuaDRiGa. The relevant citation is:
> S. Jaeckel, L. Raschkowski, K. Boerner, and L. Thiele. "QuaDRiGa: A 3-D Multi-Cell Channel Model With Time Evolution for Enabling Virtual Field Trials." *IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation*, vol. 62, no. 6, pp. 3242â€“3256, 2014.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. However, the primary dataset discussed appears to be the one generated using QuaDRiGa.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset. This will allow for clear documentation of the datasets used in the research.

In summary, the key steps I will take are:
1. Review the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on section 6 for detailed information about the datasets used in simulations.
3. Extract the full citation for the QuaDRiGa dataset from the References section.
4. Document the findings clearly to ensure all relevant dataset information is captured accurately.
