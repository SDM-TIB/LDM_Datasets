To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recurrent Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory Networks: Tutorial and Survey" by Benyamin Ghojogh and Ali Ghodsi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or applications** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but specific datasets are often detailed in the introduction or later sections.

Next, I will look for sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as **"Experiments," "Applications," or "Datasets."** In this paper, there may not be a dedicated section for datasets, so I will need to be attentive to any references to datasets throughout the text.

As I read through the paper, I will note any datasets that are mentioned, including their names and descriptions. For example, if the authors refer to datasets used for training or evaluating RNNs or LSTMs, I will document those.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For instance, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. I will ensure to capture the complete citation format, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the details, including the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry is complete and accurately reflects the information provided in the paper, ready for any further processing or review.
