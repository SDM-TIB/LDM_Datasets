To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-Supervised Sequence Modeling with Cross-View Training" by Kevin Clark et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on various sequence tagging tasks, machine translation, and dependency parsing, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention the datasets for each task:

1. **CCGBank**: Used for Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) supertagging. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Julia Hockenmaier and Mark Steedman. *CCGbank: A corpus of CCG derivations and dependency structures extracted from the Penn treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 33(3):355–396, 2007.

2. **CoNLL-2000**: Used for Text Chunking. The citation is:
   > Erik F. Tjong Kim Sang and Sabine Buchholz. *Introduction to the CoNLL-2000 shared task: Chunking*. In CoNLL, 2000.

3. **CoNLL-2003**: Used for Named Entity Recognition (NER). The citation is:
   > Erik F. Tjong Kim Sang and Fien De Meulder. *Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 shared task: Language-independent named entity recognition*. In HLT-NAACL, 2003.

4. **OntoNotes**: Used for Fine-Grained NER (FGN). The citation is:
   > Eduard Hovy, Mitchell Marcus, Martha Palmer, Lance Ramshaw, and Ralph Weischedel. *OntoNotes: The 90% solution*. In HLT-NAACL, 2006.

5. **Penn Treebank**: Used for Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging and Dependency Parsing. The citation is:
   > Mitchell P. Marcus, Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz, and Beatrice Santorini. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2):313–330, 1993.

6. **IWSLT 2015**: Used for Machine Translation. The citation is:
   > Mauro Cettolo, Jan Niehues, Sebastian St¨uker, Luisa Bentivogli, Roldano Cattoni, and Marcello Federico. *The IWSLT 2015 evaluation campaign*. In International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation, 2015.

7. **1 Billion Word Language Model Benchmark**: Used as a pool of unlabeled sentences for semi-supervised learning. The citation is:
   > Ciprian Chelba, Tomas Mikolov, Mike Schuster, Qi Ge, Thorsten Brants, Phillipp Koehn, and Tony Robinson. *One billion word benchmark for measuring progress in statistical language modeling*. In INTERSPEECH, 2014.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile their full citations accurately as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference in future work or analysis.
