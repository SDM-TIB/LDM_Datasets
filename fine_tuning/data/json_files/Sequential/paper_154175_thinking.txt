To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deceiving Computers in Reverse Turing Test through Deep Learning" by Jimut Bahan Pal, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and the sections that discuss the data** to find any explicit mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (About the Data)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. This section is crucial as it typically outlines the datasets, their sources, sizes, and any preprocessing steps taken.

In this section, I will identify and summarize each dataset mentioned:

1. **Captcha (4 letter)**: This dataset is available on Kaggle and contains 9,955 PNG images of 4-letter CAPTCHAs. The cleaned version is also provided.

2. **c4l-16x16 550**: A modified version of the previous dataset, created by extracting characters and applying Otsuâ€™s thresholding. The dataset contains 550 images for each character.

3. **JAM CAPTCHA dataset**: This dataset was scraped from the IIT-JAM website, containing 10,000 CAPTCHAs, with 308 labeled images.

4. **Resized JAM dataset**: A resized version of the JAM dataset, created for training purposes.

5. **CAPTCHA-version-2**: Available on Kaggle, this dataset contains 1,070 images of 5-letter CAPTCHAs.

6. **100000-labeled-captchas**: This dataset is available on Kaggle and contains 215 MB of labeled CAPTCHA images.

7. **Faded CAPTCHA**: A dataset generated using an open-source CAPTCHA generator, containing 604,800 files.

8. **Railway CAPTCHA**: This dataset consists of synthetic CAPTCHAs generated for various lengths (3 to 7 letters), with links provided for each version.

9. **Circle CAPTCHA**: A dataset created from a GitHub repository, containing circular CAPTCHAs.

10. **Sphinx CAPTCHA**: This dataset is derived from an open-source CAPTCHA generator and contains a significant number of images.

11. **Fish Eye CAPTCHA**: A dataset generated from a Java source code found on GitHub.

12. **Mini CAPTCHA**: A dataset created from another open-source CAPTCHA generator.

13. **Multicolor CAPTCHA**: A dataset generated with a specific difficulty level, containing a variety of colors.

After identifying these datasets, I will then look into the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For example, the citation for the **Captcha (4 letter)** dataset is:
> Genesis16. *Captcha (4 letter)*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/genesis16/captcha-4-letter.

I will compile the dataset entries, including their descriptions and citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the structured output for each dataset, ready for review or further processing.
