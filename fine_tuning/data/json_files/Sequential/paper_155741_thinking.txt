To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "SEVGGNET-LSTM: A FUSED DEEP LEARNING MODEL FOR ECG CLASSIFICATION" by Tongyue He et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that two databases are used for performance validation, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiment Configuration)**, where the authors explicitly mention the two databases used for performance evaluation:

1. **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database**: This database contains 48 recordings, each sampled at 360 Hz, and includes various types of arrhythmias for classification, such as normal rhythm (N), left bundle branch block (L), right bundle branch block (R), ventricular precontraction (V), and atrial premature contractions (A).

2. **2017 PhysioNet/CinC Challenge Database (2017PCCD)**: This database consists of 8528 single-lead ECG records collected by wearable devices at a sampling frequency of 300 Hz. It focuses on normal (N) and atrial fibrillation (AF) samples for validation.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database**, the citation is:
  > Moody, G. B., & Mark, R. G. (2001). *The MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database*. PhysioNet. Available at: https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/mitdb/

- For the **2017 PhysioNet/CinC Challenge Database**, the citation is:
  > PhysioNet. (2017). *2017 PhysioNet/CinC Challenge*. Available at: https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for any future use or reference.
