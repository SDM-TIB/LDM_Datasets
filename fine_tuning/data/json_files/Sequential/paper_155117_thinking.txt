To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Hate and Offensive Speech Detection in Hindi and Marathi" by Abhishek Velankar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information and provide full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors used the **HASOC 2021 Hindi and Marathi hate speech datasets** for their experiments, which is a clear indication that these datasets are central to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **dataset details section (Section 3)**, where the authors provide specific descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **Marathi Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,874 training samples and 625 testing samples, with binary labels indicating hate and offensive content (HOF) and non-hate content (NOT). The average sentence length is noted as 13 words.

2. **Hindi Dataset**: This dataset includes 4,594 training samples divided into two tasks. Task 1 has binary labels (HOF and NOT), while Task 2 has more fine-grained labels (NONE, OFFN, HATE, PRFN). The average sentence length is 26 words, and there are 1,532 test samples provided for both tasks.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the datasets as part of the **HASOC 2021 shared task**, so I will look for the relevant citation in the references.

The citation for the HASOC 2021 shared task is:
> S. Modha, T. Mandl, G. K. Shahi, H. Madhu, S. Satapara, T. Ranasinghe, M. Zampieri, Overview of the HASOC Subtrack at FIRE 2021: Hate Speech and Offensive Content Identification in English and Indo-Aryan Languages and Conversational Hate Speech, in: FIRE 2021: Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation, Virtual Event, 13th-17th December 2021, ACM, 2021.

Now, I will compile the dataset information along with their citations:

1. **Marathi Hate Speech Dataset**:
   - Description: Contains 1,874 training samples and 625 testing samples with binary labels (HOF and NOT).
   - Citation: 
     > S. Modha, T. Mandl, G. K. Shahi, H. Madhu, S. Satapara, T. Ranasinghe, M. Zampieri, Overview of the HASOC Subtrack at FIRE 2021: Hate Speech and Offensive Content Identification in English and Indo-Aryan Languages and Conversational Hate Speech, in: FIRE 2021: Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation, Virtual Event, 13th-17th December 2021, ACM, 2021.

2. **Hindi Hate Speech Dataset**:
   - Description: Includes 4,594 training samples with binary labels (HOF and NOT) for Task 1 and more fine-grained labels (NONE, OFFN, HATE, PRFN) for Task 2.
   - Citation: 
     > S. Modha, T. Mandl, G. K. Shahi, H. Madhu, S. Satapara, T. Ranasinghe, M. Zampieri, Overview of the HASOC Subtrack at FIRE 2021: Hate Speech and Offensive Content Identification in English and Indo-Aryan Languages and Conversational Hate Speech, in: FIRE 2021: Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation, Virtual Event, 13th-17th December 2021, ACM, 2021.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are structured properly for any further processing or review.
