To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Clustering of Bank Customers Using LSTM-Based Encoder-Decoder and Dynamic Time Warping" by Ehsan Barkhordar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the study uses a "real-world financial dataset (Berka, 2000)" for clustering bank customers. This indicates that a specific dataset is being utilized, and I need to gather more details about it.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** and **literature review** sections to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors provide context about the dataset's significance. However, the introduction primarily discusses the importance of customer clustering without introducing new datasets.

In the **results and discussion** section, the authors mention that they utilized an enhanced variant of the Beka Dataset, originally published by Berka in 2000. They describe this dataset as containing data from over 5300 customers with nearly 1,000,000 transactions, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's scope.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Beka Dataset. The relevant citation is:

- Berka, P., et al. (2000). *Guide to the financial data set*. PKDD2000 discovery challenge.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will focus solely on the Beka Dataset for my extraction.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. This will allow for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent analysis or application of the dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Beka Dataset, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
