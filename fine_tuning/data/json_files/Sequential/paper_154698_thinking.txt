To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Network Space Search for Pareto-Efficient Spaces" by Min-Fong Hong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that the authors might have used in their experiments or evaluations. If the introduction does not provide specific names, I will continue to the **experiments section**, where datasets are typically detailed.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, which is likely to contain information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, I will look for any mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research.

Upon reviewing the experiments section, I find that the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets for their evaluations. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, such as their purpose and any specific configurations used in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
> Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Master’s thesis, Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, 2009.

For the **CIFAR-100 dataset**, the citation is:
> Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Master’s thesis, Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, 2009.

Both datasets are derived from the same source, so I will ensure to note that in my dataset extraction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the study.
