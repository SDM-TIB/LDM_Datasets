To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conditioning Deep Generative Raw Audio Models for Structured Automatic Music" by Rachel Manzelli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the research but does not specify any datasets. The introduction discusses the context of music generation but does not name any datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Empirical Evaluation)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for training their models. In this section, they mention the **MusicNet dataset** as the primary dataset for training their models. They provide some statistics about this dataset, indicating its relevance and the type of data it contains.

The authors describe the MusicNet dataset as featuring both raw audio and melodic annotations, which is crucial for their research. They also mention that it includes metadata such as the composer, instrument, and note positions, which adds to its utility for training their models.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citation for the MusicNet dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For **MusicNet dataset**:
  > J. Thickstun, Z. Harchaoui, and S. M Kakade. *Learning features of music from scratch*. In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2017.

Additionally, the authors mention using audio from the **YouTube-8M dataset** for training their unconditioned WaveNet model. I will also look for its citation in the references:

- For **YouTube-8M dataset**:
  > S. Abu-El-Haija, N. Kothari, J. Lee, P. Natsev, G. Toderici, B. Varadarajan, and S. Vijayanarasimhan. *YouTube-8M: A large-scale video classification benchmark*. CoRR, abs/1609.08675, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
