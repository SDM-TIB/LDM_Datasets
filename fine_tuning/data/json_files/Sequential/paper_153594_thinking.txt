To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Forecasting Bitcoin closing price series using linear regression and neural networks models" by Nicola Uras et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors forecast daily closing price series of Bitcoin using data on prices and volumes of prior days, indicating that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss their approach to forecasting Bitcoin prices and mention comparing their results with other studies. This suggests that they are using specific datasets for their analysis.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in **section 3.2 (Collected data)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets they used for their experiments:

1. **Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Daily Stock Prices**: This dataset includes daily stock market prices for Microsoft from September 12, 2007, to November 11, 2011.

2. **Intel Corporation (INTC) Daily Stock Prices**: This dataset includes daily stock market prices for Intel from September 12, 2007, to November 11, 2010.

3. **National Bankshares Inc. (NKSH) Daily Stock Prices**: This dataset includes daily stock market prices for National Bankshares from June 27, 2008, to August 29, 2011.

4. **Bitcoin Daily Price Series**: This dataset includes daily closing prices of Bitcoin from November 15, 2015, to August 11, 2018.

The authors also mention that they chose these datasets to compare their results with well-known literature, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from publicly available sources (Yahoo Finance for stock prices and CoinMarketCap for Bitcoin prices), I will provide citations based on the sources mentioned in the paper:

- For **Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)**, **Intel Corporation (INTC)**, and **National Bankshares Inc. (NKSH)**, the citation is:
  > Yahoo Finance. *Historical Data for Microsoft Corporation, Intel Corporation, and National Bankshares Inc.* [Online]. Available: https://finance.yahoo.com

- For **Bitcoin Daily Price Series**, the citation is:
  > CoinMarketCap. *Historical Data for Bitcoin.* [Online]. Available: https://coinmarketcap.com

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are captured for future reference or processing.
