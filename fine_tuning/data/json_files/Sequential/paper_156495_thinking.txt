To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluation of QCNN-LSTM for Disability Forecasting in Multiple Sclerosis using Sequential Multisequence MRI" by John D. Mayfield et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the study involves MRI data from patients diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which suggests that there is a dataset related to MRI images. The introduction further elaborates on the dataset, indicating that it consists of sequential MRI data from patients.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the **data** section (4.1) provides detailed information about the dataset used. It states that the study involved a total of 2,232 patients diagnosed with MS, with a specific focus on those who had at least two contrast-enhanced multisequence MRIs, resulting in a cohort of 703 patients.

I will note the key details about the dataset:
- **Dataset Name**: Sequential MRI Data of Patients with Multiple Sclerosis
- **Description**: The dataset includes MRI data from 2,232 patients diagnosed with MS, with a focus on 703 patients who had at least two contrast-enhanced multisequence MRIs. The average patient age was 46.6 years, and the average Extended Disability Severity Score (EDSS) was 3.5.
- **Data Partitioning**: The data was split into training, validation, and holdout testing sets using a 60:20:20 ratio.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since this dataset is derived from a clinical study and does not have a formal citation like a published dataset, I will summarize it as follows:

- **Citation**: This dataset is based on the clinical data collected from the USF Health Neuroimmunology department in collaboration with Tampa General Hospital (TGH) from 2006 to 2023.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation and relevant details for clarity.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **Dataset Name**: Sequential MRI Data of Patients with Multiple Sclerosis
   - **Description**: MRI data from 2,232 patients diagnosed with MS, focusing on 703 patients with at least two contrast-enhanced multisequence MRIs.
   - **Citation**: Clinical data from USF Health Neuroimmunology department and Tampa General Hospital (2006-2023).

This structured approach ensures that I capture all necessary details and provide proper citations for the datasets mentioned in the research paper.
