To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Weight Factorization for Multilingual Speech Recognition" by Ngoc-Quan Pham et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on a compositional speech corpus, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Mozilla Common Voice**: This dataset contains up to 27 languages and is a widely used multilingual speech corpus.
2. **Euronews**: This dataset includes 4 languages and is specifically designed for automatic speech recognition tasks.
3. **Europarl-ST**: This dataset consists of 9 languages and is used for speech translation of parliamentary debates.

In this section, the authors also provide details about the preprocessing steps, which further confirms the datasets' relevance to their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **Mozilla Common Voice**, the citation is:
  > R. Ardila, M. Branson, K. Davis, M. Henretty, M. Kohler, J. Meyer, R. Morais, L. Saunders, F. M. Tyers, and G. Weber. *Common voice: A massively-multilingual speech corpus*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1912.06670, 2019.

- For **Euronews**, the citation is:
  > R. Gretter. *Euronews: a multilingual speech corpus for ASR*. In LREC, 2014, pp. 2635–2638.

- For **Europarl-ST**, the citation is:
  > J. Iranzo-Sánchez, J. A. Silvestre-Cerdà, J. Jorge, N. Roselló, A. Giménez, A. Sanchis, J. Civera, and A. Juan. *Europarl-ST: A multilingual corpus for speech translation of parliamentary debates*. In ICASSP, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
