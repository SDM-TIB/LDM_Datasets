To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Translating neural signals to text using a Brain-Machine Interface" by Janaki Sheth et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a BCI system that decodes text from neural signals, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the **experimental design** subsection, where the authors describe how data was obtained from patients. They mention that data was collected from neurosurgical patients implanted with intracranial depth electrodes. This indicates that there is a dataset related to the neural recordings from these patients.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics based on the data collected from six patients. They mention the variability in the number of trials and phonemes per subject, which further confirms the existence of a dataset derived from these experiments.

Now, I will look for specific details about the dataset, such as the number of subjects, types of recordings, and any preprocessing steps mentioned. The authors state that the data was collected while subjects repeated individual words or vowels, and they provide a range of trials per subject, which gives insight into the dataset's structure.

Next, I will check the **references section** for any citations related to the datasets used. The authors refer to previous studies and datasets that may have been utilized in their research. I will ensure to capture the full citations for any datasets mentioned.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile the following datasets:

1. **Neural Recordings Dataset**: This dataset consists of neural recordings from six patients who were implanted with intracranial depth electrodes. The recordings were made while subjects repeated individual words or vowels, with a variable number of trials per subject.

2. **Brown Corpus**: The authors mention using the Brown corpus to create a language model for their BCI system. This corpus contains over 2 million words compiled from various documents published in the United States in 1961.

Now, I will retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Brown Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Francis, W. and Kucera, H. (1979). *Brown corpus manual*. Technical report, Brown University.

- For the **Neural Recordings Dataset**, since it is derived from the authors' own experiments, I will cite the paper itself:
  > Sheth, J., Tankus, A., Tran, M., Pouratian, N., Fried, I., & Speier, W. (2023). *Translating neural signals to text using a Brain-Machine Interface*. Preprint. Under review.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.
