To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How to Train Your Super-Net: An Analysis of Training Heuristics in Weight-Sharing NAS" by Kaicheng Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention leveraging three benchmark search spaces: **NASBench-101**, **NASBench-201**, and **DARTS-NDS**. This indicates that these are the datasets of interest, but I need to confirm their details in the methodology section.

Next, I will look into the **evaluation methodology section**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they specify the characteristics of each dataset:

1. **NASBench-101**: This dataset consists of 423,624 architectures and is compatible with weight-sharing NAS. It provides ground-truth performance for a large number of architectures.

2. **NASBench-201**: This dataset contains 15,625 architectures and includes more operations than NASBench-101 but fewer nodes. It also provides ground-truth performance metrics.

3. **DARTS-NDS**: This dataset includes a subset of 5,000 models that were sampled and trained in a stand-alone fashion, allowing for performance evaluation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **NASBench-101**:
  > Ying, C., Klein, A., Real, E., Christiansen, E., Murphy, K., & Hutter, F. (2019). *NAS-Bench-101: Towards reproducible neural architecture search*. arXiv:1902.09635. URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09635.

- For **NASBench-201**:
  > Dong, X., & Yang, Y. (2020). *NAS-Bench-201: Extending the scope of reproducible neural architecture search*. In International Conference on Learning Representations. URL: https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJxyZkBKDr.

- For **DARTS-NDS**:
  > Liu, H., Simonyan, K., & Yang, Y. (2019). *DARTS: Differentiable architecture search*. International Conference on Learning Representations. URL: https://openreview.net/forum?id=HylxE1HKwS.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
