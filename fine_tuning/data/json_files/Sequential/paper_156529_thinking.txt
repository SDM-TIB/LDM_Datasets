To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reduced-Order Modeling of Unsteady Fluid Flow Using Neural Network Ensembles" by Rakesh Halder et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for validation or testing.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference existing datasets that are relevant to their study. This section may also provide insights into the datasets used in their experiments.

In the **methods section**, I will look for a dedicated subsection on datasets, where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail, including their characteristics, size, and how they were utilized in the study. This section is crucial for gathering specific information about the datasets.

I will also examine the **results section** to see if the authors mention any datasets when discussing their findings or comparing their results with previous work. This may provide additional context or validation for the datasets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used the **Lid-Driven Cavity Dataset** and the **2D Cylinder Dataset**, I will look for their respective citations in the references. If the citations are not directly provided, I will search for the original papers or sources that introduced these datasets.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while maintaining proper academic integrity through citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that they are clear and complete for any downstream applications.
