To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Memory-Based Semantic Parsing" by Parag Jain and Mirella Lapata, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their approach on three semantic parsing benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the importance of semantic parsing and mention specific applications. They reference previous works that may have utilized datasets, but I need to find explicit mentions of datasets used in their experiments.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation: 

1. **ATIS Dataset**: This dataset is referenced multiple times throughout the paper, particularly in the context of evaluating their model's performance on semantic parsing tasks.

2. **SParC Dataset**: The authors mention this dataset as part of their evaluation, indicating its relevance to their research.

3. **CoSQL Dataset**: This dataset is also highlighted as a benchmark for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **ATIS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Deborah A. Dahl, Madeleine Bates, Michael Brown, William Fisher, Kate Hunicke-Smith, David Pallett, Christine Pao, Alexander Rudnicky, and Elizabeth Shriberg. *Expanding the scope of the ATIS task: The ATIS-3 corpus*. In Human Language Technology: Proceedings of a Workshop held at Plainsboro, New Jersey, March 8-11, 1994.

- For the **SParC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tao Yu, Rui Zhang, Kai Yang, Michihiro Yasunaga, Dongxu Wang, Zifan Li, and Dragomir Radev. *SParC: Cross-domain semantic parsing in context*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 4511–4523, Florence, Italy, 2019.

- For the **CoSQL Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tao Yu, Rui Zhang, Heyang Er, Suyi Li, Eric Xue, Bo Pang, Xi Victoria Lin, Yi Chern Tan, Tianze Shi, Zifan Li, Youxuan Jiang, Michihiro Yasunaga, Sungrok Shim, Tao Chen, Alexander Fabbri, Zifan Li, Luyao Chen, Yuwen Zhang, Shreya Dixit, Vincent Zhang, Caiming Xiong, Richard Socher, Walter Lasecki, and Dragomir Radev. *CoSQL: A conversational text-to-SQL challenge towards cross-domain natural language interfaces to databases*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing, pages 1962–1979, Hong Kong, China, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the study.
