To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-supervised Word Sense Disambiguation with Neural Models" by Dayu Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors discuss the use of LSTM models for word sense disambiguation (WSD) and mention achieving state-of-the-art results on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of WSD and the need for sufficient labeled training data. They reference previous works and datasets, which may provide clues about the datasets they are using.

I will then examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) in detail, as it typically contains specific information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. The authors mention using several datasets, including:

1. **SemCor**: A dataset that contains sense-annotated examples for training WSD models. It is a well-known resource in the field of natural language processing.

2. **MASC (Multi-Genre Annotated Syntactic Corpus)**: Another dataset mentioned for training purposes, which provides a variety of annotated sentences.

3. **NOAD (New Oxford American Dictionary)**: This dataset is used for providing example sentences for each word sense, which is crucial for evaluating the performance of the proposed algorithms.

In the experiments, the authors also refer to specific tasks from **SemEval**, which is a series of evaluations for semantic analysis tasks, indicating that they used datasets from these evaluations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **SemCor**, the citation is:
  > Miller, G. A., Leacock, C., Tengi, R., & Bunker, R. T. (1993). A semantic concordance. In Proceedings of the workshop on Human Language Technology (pp. 303-308). Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **MASC**, the citation is:
  > Taghipour, K., & Ng, H. T. (2015). One million sense-tagged instances for word sense disambiguation and induction. CoNLL 2015, page 338.

- For **NOAD**, the citation is:
  > Stevenson, A., & Lindberg, C. A. (2010). New Oxford American Dictionary. Oxford University Press.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
