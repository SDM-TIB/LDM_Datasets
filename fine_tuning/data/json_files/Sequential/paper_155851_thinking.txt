To extract datasets from the research paper titled "From Single-Visit to Multi-Visit Image-Based Models: Single-Visit Models are Enough to Predict Obstructive Hydronephrosis" by Stanley Bryan Z. Hua et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the use of ultrasound images for predicting renal obstruction, which suggests that there may be datasets related to ultrasound images.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly the **2.1 Study Design** subsection, where the authors describe the data collection process. They mention that ultrasound imaging data were sourced from the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) and evaluated on data from two external institutions: Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital (Stanford) and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). This indicates that there are multiple datasets involved.

In the **3.1 Data** subsection, the authors provide specific details about the datasets used for training and evaluation. They mention:

1. **SickKids Test Set**: This dataset consists of 321 patient trajectories from 600 clinic visits, used for training and evaluation.
2. **SickKids Silent Trial**: An additional test set from SickKids, comprising 202 patients and 244 examples, specifically collected to evaluate the baseline model.
3. **Stanford Dataset**: Contains 102 patients with 204 examples, most having two or more visits.
4. **CHOP Dataset**: Includes 89 patients, each imaged only once, with a higher proportion of positive examples.

I will also check the **results section** to confirm that these datasets were indeed used for evaluation and to gather any performance metrics associated with them.

Next, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The SickKids dataset is likely referenced in the original study by Erdman et al. (2020), which I will cite accordingly. The other datasets may not have specific citations in the references but will be noted as institutional datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citations for any referenced datasets, particularly the SickKids dataset. 

Now, I will prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include all relevant details and citations.
