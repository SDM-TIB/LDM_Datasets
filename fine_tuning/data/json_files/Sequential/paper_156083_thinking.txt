To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Stock Market time-series data using CNN-LSTM Neural Network model" by Aadhitya A et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of "real-time stock market data" and "stock market datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed involved. However, I need to identify specific datasets mentioned in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experimental analysis** section. In the provided text, the authors mention gathering datasets from **Kaggle** and using the **Alpha Vantage API** to collect stock data. This suggests that there are specific datasets that were utilized for their experiments.

In the **experimental analysis** section, the authors list several datasets they tested their model on, including:

1. **Kaggle Stock Market Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a source for sample data. I will need to find the full citation for this dataset.
2. **NIFTY-50 Stock Market Data**: The authors mention this dataset specifically, and I will look for its citation.
3. **NASDAQ Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned, and I will need to find its citation.
4. **NYSE Dataset**: The authors refer to this dataset as well, and I will look for its citation.
5. **BSE (RELIANCE)**: This dataset is mentioned as a real dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations I need to extract include:

- For the **Kaggle Stock Market Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kaggle, Huge Stock Market Dataset (online). Link: https://www.kaggle.com/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs

- For the **NIFTY-50 Stock Market Data**, the citation is:
  > Kaggle, NIFTY-50 Stock Market Data (2000-2021) (online). Link: https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/nifty50-stock-market-data

- For the **NASDAQ Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kaggle, Stock Market Data (NASDAQ, NYSE, S&P500). Link: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/stock-market-data

- For the **NYSE Dataset**, it is included in the same citation as the NASDAQ dataset.

- For the **BSE (RELIANCE)** dataset, I will need to check if there is a specific citation provided in the references or if it is part of the general stock market datasets mentioned.

After gathering all the necessary citations, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
