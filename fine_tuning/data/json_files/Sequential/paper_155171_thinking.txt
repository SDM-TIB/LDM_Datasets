To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Non-Stationary Time-Series with Dynamic Pattern Extractions" by Xipei Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the research focuses on forecasting future trends in non-stationary time-series data, specifically highlighting the use of Forex data. This indicates that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will examine **section III (Forex Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used in their research. Here, they describe the Forex market data collected over several years, including attributes such as datetime, open, close, high, low prices, and volume for various currency pairs. They specifically mention focusing on the USD to JPY currency pair from 2015 to 2019, which contains over 120,000 records.

In this section, the authors also clarify that the data was obtained using the **fxcmpy** library, which is crucial for citing the dataset correctly. 

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper cites the source of the Forex data as follows:

- For the Forex dataset, the citation is:
  > FXCM. fxcmpy â€“ algorithmic trading with fxcm, 2020. URL https://www.fxcm.com/fxcmpy/.

This citation provides the necessary details to reference the dataset accurately.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and prepare to format them according to the required structure. The key dataset extracted from this paper is the Forex dataset, specifically the USD to JPY currency pair data from 2015 to 2019.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Forex dataset as it is critical for proper attribution in any subsequent use or analysis.
