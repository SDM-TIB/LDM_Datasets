To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Emotional Voice Conversion Using Multitask Learning with Text-to-Speech" by Tae-Ho Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were performed on a male Korean emotional text-to-speech dataset, which suggests that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset they constructed. Here, they mention the **male Korean Emotional Text-to-Speech (mKETTS) dataset**, which consists of 21,000 utterances recorded in seven different emotions. This section provides essential details about the dataset, including the number of sentences, emotions, and recording conditions.

Now, I need to ensure I have the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is constructed by the authors themselves, I will cite it as follows:
- **mKETTS Dataset**: 
  > Tae-Ho Kim, Sungjae Cho, Shinkook Choi, Sejik Park, and Soo-Young Lee. *Emotional Voice Conversion Using Multitask Learning with Text-to-Speech*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year], [Pages]. (Note: Replace placeholders with actual conference details if available).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation in a structured format.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are accurately captured and formatted correctly.
