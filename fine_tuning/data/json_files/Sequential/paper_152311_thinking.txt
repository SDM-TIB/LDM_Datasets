To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conditional Image Generation with PixelCNN Decoders" by AÃ¤ron van den Oord et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the model's ability to generate images conditioned on class labels from the ImageNet database, which suggests that ImageNet is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 3) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset** and the **ImageNet dataset** for evaluating their models. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the **experiments subsection 3.1**, the authors compare their model's performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. This confirms that CIFAR-10 is indeed a dataset used in their work.

In subsection 3.2, they discuss class-conditional modeling of images from the **ImageNet dataset**, which contains a vast number of images across various categories. This further solidifies the importance of ImageNet in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

2. For the **ImageNet dataset**, the citation is:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
