To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Short note on the behavior of recurrent neural network for noisy dynamical system" by Kyongmin Yeo, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM) trained on the Mackey-Glass time series, which suggests that this time series data is a key dataset in the study.

Next, I will examine the **Numerical Experiments** section, where the author describes the methodology and the specific dataset used. The Mackey-Glass time series is explicitly mentioned as the dataset for the experiments, and the author details how noisy observations of this time series are generated. This indicates that the Mackey-Glass time series is the primary dataset utilized in the research.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **conclusions** or **references** sections. However, the paper primarily focuses on the Mackey-Glass time series, and no other datasets are indicated.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the Mackey-Glass time series dataset. The original paper that introduced the Mackey-Glass equation is:

> Mackey, M., & Glass, L. (1977). Oscillation and chaos in physiological control systems. *Science*, 197(4300), 287-289.

This citation will be important for documenting the dataset properly.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Mackey-Glass time series dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
