To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Light Gated Recurrent Units for Speech Recognition" by Mirco Ravanelli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their proposed model on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used in their experiments. This prompts me to look for specific names and details in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used in their experiments. They present a table (Table I) that lists the main features of the training datasets, including:

1. **TIMIT**: A well-known dataset for phoneme recognition, which includes 5 hours of speech from 462 speakers and 12,000 sentences.
2. **DIRHA**: This dataset is used for distant speech recognition and consists of 75 hours of speech from 87 speakers and 8,000 sentences.
3. **CHiME**: A dataset designed for speech recognition in noisy environments, containing 166 hours of speech from 820 speakers and 272,191 sentences.
4. **TED**: A dataset comprising 5 hours of speech from TED talks, with a total of 820 talks.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. 

- For **TIMIT**, the citation is:
  > J. Allen and D. Berkley, "Image method for efficiently simulating small-room acoustics," J. Acoust. Soc. Am, 1979.

- For **DIRHA**, the citation is:
  > M. Ravanelli, L. Cristoforetti, R. Gretter, M. Pellin, A. Sosi, and M. Omologo, "The DIRHA-English corpus and related tasks for distant-speech recognition in domestic environments," in Proc. of ASRU, 2015, pp. 275–282.

- For **CHiME**, the citation is:
  > J. Barker, R. Marxer, E. Vincent, and S. Watanabe, "The third CHiME Speech Separation and Recognition Challenge: Dataset, task and baselines," in Proc. of ASRU, 2015, pp. 504–511.

- For **TED**, the citation is:
  > M. Federico, L. Bentivogli, M. Paul, and S. Stüker, "Overview of the IWSLT 2011 evaluation campaign," in Proc. of IWSLT, 2011.

With the dataset names and their corresponding citations collected, I will ensure that I format this information clearly and accurately for any further processing or documentation needs. This structured approach allows me to comprehensively extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
