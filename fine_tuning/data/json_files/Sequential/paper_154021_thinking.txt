To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A sentiment analysis odyssey" by Shivaji Alaparthi and Manit Mishra, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses a "publicly available labeled corpora of 50,000 movie reviews originally posted on internet movie database (IMDB)." This suggests that there is a specific dataset being utilized.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or analysis sections**. In this case, the paper explicitly states that the dataset consists of 50,000 movie reviews, which is crucial information.

I will also check the **analysis section**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the dataset was first introduced and curated by Maas et al. (2011), which provides a clear reference point for the dataset's origin.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the dataset mentioned:

- For the **IMDB movie reviews dataset**, the citation is:
  > Maas, A.L., Daly, R.E., Pham, P.T., Huang, D., Ng, A.Y., and Potts, C. (2011). "Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis." In Proceedings of the 49th annual meeting of the association for computational linguistics: Human language technologies-volume 1, Association for Computational Linguistics, Portland, Oregon, pp. 142-150.

After identifying the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, the key steps I took include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Identifying specific datasets in the methodology or analysis sections.
3. Retrieving full citations from the references section for each dataset mentioned.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
