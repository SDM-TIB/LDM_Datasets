To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Wind Park Power Prediction: Attention-Based Graph Networks and Deep Learning to Capture Wake Losses" by Lars Ã˜degaard Bentsen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention datasets used for training or evaluation. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Methodology)**, where the authors describe the data used for their experiments. Here, they mention that the wind farm data was simulated in **FLORIS** using a Gaussian-based wake model. This indicates that the dataset is derived from a simulation rather than real-world measurements, which is important to note.

In this section, the authors specify that **18,280 different scenarios** were simulated, resulting in **1,200,862 power values for individual turbines**. This detail is crucial as it outlines the scale and nature of the dataset.

I will also check the **Acknowledgements and References sections** for any additional datasets or sources that may have been used or referenced. The authors acknowledge the developers of FLORIS, which is a simulation tool, but they do not mention any other datasets.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format. The key dataset identified is:

1. **FLORIS Simulated Wind Farm Data**: This dataset consists of simulated scenarios for wind farm configurations, including various wind speeds and directions, resulting in a large number of power output values for individual turbines.

For the citation of the FLORIS tool, I will refer to the reference provided in the paper:

- **FLORIS**: 
  > NREL. FLORIS. version 2.4, 2021.

Since the dataset is derived from a simulation tool rather than a traditional dataset with authorship, the citation reflects the tool used to generate the data.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset entry with the relevant details, ensuring that the citation is included for proper attribution. This will allow for a clear understanding of the dataset's origin and context within the research.
