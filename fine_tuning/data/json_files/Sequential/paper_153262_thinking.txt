To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Neural Architecture Transformation Search in Channel-Level for Object Detection" by Junran Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on the **COCO dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges of object detection and the need for effective datasets, but I need to confirm the exact datasets used.

In **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, the authors explicitly state that they use the **MS-COCO dataset** for their experiments. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of training and validation images, which confirms its use in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the COCO dataset. The citation is as follows:
> T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Doll√°r, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In ECCV, 2014.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the COCO dataset for its experiments, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the COCO dataset, ready for further processing or review.
