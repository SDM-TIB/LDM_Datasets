To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Factorization Tricks for LSTM Networks" by Oleksii Kuchaiev and Boris Ginsburg, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, models, experiments, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors tested their methods on the **One Billion Word Benchmark**, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the use of the One Billion Word Benchmark for evaluating their models. This section confirms that this dataset is central to their experiments.

In the **experiments and results section**, the authors provide details about the models tested, specifically mentioning the **One Billion Word Benchmark** again. They describe how they trained various LSTM architectures on this dataset, which reinforces its significance in their research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the One Billion Word Benchmark. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **One Billion Word Benchmark**:
  > Ciprian Chelba, Tomas Mikolov, Mike Schuster, Qi Ge, Thorsten Brants, Phillipp Koehn, and Tony Robinson. *One billion word benchmark for measuring progress in statistical language modeling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.3005, 2013.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the One Billion Word Benchmark, ensuring that the citation is accurately represented and ready for further processing or review.
