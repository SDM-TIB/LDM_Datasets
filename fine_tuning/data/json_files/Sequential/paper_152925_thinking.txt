To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Emotional End-to-End Neural Speech Synthesizer" by Younggun Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but the experiments section is likely where the datasets are detailed.

In the **experiments section (Section 3)**, the authors mention training their emotional Tacotron on a **Korean dataset from Acriil** that contains <text, audio, emotion label> pairs. This indicates that there is a specific dataset used for their experiments, and I need to gather more details about it.

The authors describe that the dataset consists of recordings from a female actor reading news articles in six different emotions: neutral, angry, fear, happy, sad, and surprise. They also mention that the dataset contains **21 hours of speech** and that they used sequences of less than 200 characters and wav files shorter than 8.7 seconds after silence trimming.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Korean dataset from Acriil**. However, it appears that the dataset is not cited in the references, which is common for proprietary or less widely known datasets. In this case, I will note that the dataset is from Acriil but may not have a formal citation.

Additionally, the authors mention using a **Korean dataset from ETRI** that contains **17 hours of drama scripts** recorded by a female actor with a natural tone. This is another dataset that I need to include.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper, but it seems that these two datasets are the primary ones used in their experiments.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

1. **Korean dataset from Acriil**: Contains <text, audio, emotion label> pairs, with 21 hours of speech recorded in six different emotions. No formal citation is available.

2. **Korean dataset from ETRI**: Contains 17 hours of drama scripts recorded by a female actor. Again, no formal citation is provided.

Since both datasets do not have formal citations in the references, I will note that they are proprietary datasets and provide the context in which they were used.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I highlight the lack of formal citations where applicable.
