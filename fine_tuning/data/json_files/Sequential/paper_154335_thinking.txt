To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Reinforcement Learning Approach to the Orienteering Problem with Time Windows" by Ricardo Gama and Hugo L. Fernandes, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the Orienteering Problem with Time Windows (OPTW) and its applications, which may hint at the datasets used for evaluation. I will pay attention to any references to benchmark datasets or instances.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly section 4.1, where the authors describe the benchmark instances used for their experiments. Here, they mention three groups of benchmark instances: **Solomon, Cordeau, and Gavalas**. I will extract details about these datasets, including their characteristics and the number of instances in each group.

In the **experiments section**, the authors may provide additional context on how these datasets were utilized in their experiments, confirming their relevance and importance.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. I will refer to the references section to find the original sources for the Solomon, Cordeau, and Gavalas datasets.

1. **Solomon Benchmark Instances**: The authors refer to the Solomon instances as established benchmarks in the OPTW literature. The citation for the original work is:
   > Solomon, M. M. (1987). *Algorithms for the Vehicle Routing and Scheduling Problems with Time Window Constraints*. Operations Research, 35(2), 254-265.

2. **Cordeau Benchmark Instances**: The Cordeau instances are also well-known in the literature. The citation is:
   > Cordeau, J. F., Laporte, G., & Mercier, A. (2001). *A unified tabu search heuristic for vehicle routing problems with time windows*. Journal of the Operational Research Society, 52(8), 928-936.

3. **Gavalas Benchmark Instances**: The Gavalas instances were designed to reflect real-world tourist trip design problems. The citation is:
   > Gavalas, D., Konstantopoulos, C., Mastakas, K., & Pantziou, G. (2019). *Efficient Cluster-Based Heuristics for the Team Orienteering Problem with Time Windows*. Asia-Pacific Journal of Operational Research, 36(01), 1-44.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective sources.
