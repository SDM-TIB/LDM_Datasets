To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mean Absolute Directional Loss as a New Loss Function for Machine Learning Problems in Algorithmic Investment Strategies" by Jakub Micha≈Ñko et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used data from two different asset classes: cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin) and commodities (Crude Oil). This suggests that these two datasets are crucial for the study.

Next, I will examine **section 3.4 (Data)**, where the authors provide more details about the datasets used. Here, they specify that they used daily simple returns based on data from Bitcoin and Crude Oil (represented by the ETF USO) covering the period from April 1, 2023, to December 31, 2021. This section confirms the datasets I need to extract.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** for these datasets in the **References section**. The authors mention the sources of the data:

1. **Bitcoin Data**: The data was sourced from multiple exchanges, including Kraken, Bitfinex, BTC-e, CEX, and Coinbase. However, since there is no specific citation provided for Bitcoin data in the references, I will note that it is derived from these exchanges without a formal citation.

2. **Crude Oil Data (USO)**: The data for USO was obtained from stooq.com. Again, there is no formal citation in the references for this specific dataset, but I will document the source as stooq.com.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Bitcoin Dataset**: Daily simple returns data sourced from Kraken, Bitfinex, BTC-e, CEX, and Coinbase for the period from April 1, 2023, to December 31, 2021. (No formal citation available)

- **Crude Oil Dataset (USO)**: Daily simple returns data sourced from stooq.com for the same period. (No formal citation available)

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that I highlight the lack of formal citations for the datasets derived from exchanges and websites.
