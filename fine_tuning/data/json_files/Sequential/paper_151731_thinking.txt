To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Been There, Done That: Meta-Learning with Episodic Recall" by Samuel Ritter et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any explicit mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to delve deeper into the body of the paper for specific dataset information.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. The authors describe five experiments, and I will look for any datasets referenced in each of these experiments.

1. **Experiment 1: Barcode Bandits** - The authors mention using contextual multi-armed bandits with binary strings as contexts. However, they do not specify a formal dataset name, so I will note that this is a synthetic dataset created for the experiment.

2. **Experiment 2: Omniglot Bandits** - The authors refer to using pretrained Omniglot embeddings from Kaiser et al. (2017). This indicates that the Omniglot dataset is used, which is a well-known dataset for character recognition tasks.

3. **Experiment 3: Compositional Bandits** - Similar to Experiment 1, the authors describe a setup involving contextual bandits but do not mention a specific dataset name. This appears to be another synthetic dataset.

4. **Experiment 4: Contextual Water Maze** - The authors do not mention a specific dataset but describe a task setup that seems to be constructed for the experiment.

5. **Experiment 5: Episodic Two-Step Task** - The authors reference the two-step task as described by Daw et al. (2011), which is a standard experimental setup in reinforcement learning but does not refer to a specific dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations I need to extract are:

- For the **Omniglot dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lake, B. M., Salakhutdinov, R., & Tenenbaum, J. B. (2015). Human-level concept learning through probabilistic program induction. *Science*, 350, 1332-1338.

- For the **two-step task**, the citation is:
  > Daw, N. D., Gershman, S. J., Seymour, B., Dayan, P., & Dolan, R. J. (2011). Model-based influences on humans' choices and striatal prediction errors. *Neuron*, 69(6), 1204-1215.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset identified, particularly focusing on the Omniglot dataset and the two-step task, while noting the synthetic datasets used in the other experiments without formal citations.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately document the datasets referenced in the paper, along with their proper citations for future reference or analysis.
