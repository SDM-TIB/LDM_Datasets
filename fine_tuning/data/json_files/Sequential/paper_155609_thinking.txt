To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Building a Chatbot on a Closed Domain using RASA" by Nam Nhat Le et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the chatbot system and mentions that a chatbot corpus was manually constructed, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section** where the authors discuss the construction of the chatbot system. They mention that the chatbot is designed to answer questions about the College of Information and Communication Technology (CICT) and that they constructed a chatbot corpus with specific details about intents, sentence patterns, entities, and stories. This indicates that the authors have created a dataset for their chatbot.

In the **proposed approach section**, the authors detail the construction of the NLU data, which consists of 19 intents, 441 sentence patterns, 253 entities, and 133 stories. This section provides concrete numbers that can be used to describe the dataset.

In the **experiments and results section**, the authors mention that the dataset includes 441 questions belonging to 19 intents, 253 entities, 133 stories, and 1,336 response actions. This further confirms the existence of a structured dataset used for training and evaluating the chatbot.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset and look for any references that provide full citations. The paper does not cite external datasets but rather describes the dataset they constructed for their specific research. Therefore, I will create a citation for the dataset based on the authors and the context of the research.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **Chatbot Corpus**: This dataset includes:
   - 19 intents
   - 441 sentence patterns
   - 253 entities
   - 133 stories
   - 1,336 response actions

The citation for this dataset will be:
> Nam Nhat Le, Khang Nhut Lam, and Jugal Kalita. *Building a Chatbot on a Closed Domain using RASA*. In Proceedings of the NLPIR 2020, December 18â€“20, 2020, Seoul, Republic of Korea. 

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format for further processing or review.
