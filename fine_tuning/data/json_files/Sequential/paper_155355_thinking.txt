To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Offensive Language Detection in Under-resourced Algerian Dialectal Arabic Language" by Oussama Boucherit and Kheireddine Abainia, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and corpus sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors built a new corpus for detecting offensive language in Facebook comments, which suggests that a dataset is present.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of detecting offensive language in dialectal Arabic and mention the need for a new corpus due to the lack of existing resources. This reinforces the idea that they have created a dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **corpus section** where the authors explicitly describe the dataset they created, referred to as **DziriOFN**. They mention that this corpus contains **10,258 comments** that have been manually annotated into three categories: offensive, abusive, and normal. The details about the data collection process and annotation rounds provide further context about the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, since the DziriOFN corpus is newly created by the authors, it may not have a separate citation in the references. Instead, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Oussama Boucherit and Kheireddine Abainia. *Offensive Language Detection in Under-resourced Algerian Dialectal Arabic Language*. PIMIS Laboratory, Departement of Electronics & Telecommunications, Universit√© 8 Mai 1945, Guelma, Algeria.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and citation.

After completing this, I will have a clear and concise entry for the DziriOFN dataset ready for further processing or review.
