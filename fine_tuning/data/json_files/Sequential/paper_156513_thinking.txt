To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "D-Nikud: Enhancing Hebrew Diacritization with LSTM and Pretrained Models" by Adi Rosenthal and Nadav Shaked, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors showcase state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data)**, particularly the subsections **3.1 (Data Sources)** and **3.2 (Full Script Reconciliation)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training their model. In subsection 3.1, they mention two main sources for their training data:

1. **Nakdimon Training Corpora**: This dataset is compiled from various genres, including blogs, books, and news articles, totaling 1.81 million Hebrew tokens. The authors provide a detailed breakdown of the number of files and tokens by genre, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's composition.

2. **Dicta Organization Data**: This dataset includes half a million words from standard-score Wikipedia in "ktiv male" format, which is also essential for the training of their model.

In subsection 3.1, the authors also mention that they have a manually curated collection of modern Hebrew texts, which were diacritized using Dicta and corrected for errors. This dataset spans about 1.5 million Hebrew tokens and is noted for its consistency.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Nakdimon Training Corpora**, the citation is:
  > Elazar Gershuni and Yuval Pinter. *Restoring Hebrew Diacritics Without a Dictionary*. 2022, March. Available at: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.05209.pdf.

- For the **Dicta Organization Data**, the citation is:
  > Avi Shmidman, Shaltiel Shmidman, Moshe Koppel, and Yoav Goldberg. *Nakdan: Professional Hebrew Diacritizer*. 2020, March. Available at: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03312.pdf.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for further processing or review.
