To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Time Series Forecasting with Stacked Long Short-Term Memory Networks" by Frank Xiao, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of LSTM networks for traffic volume forecasting, which suggests that there may be specific datasets related to traffic data.

In the **introduction**, the author mentions analyzing real traffic volume data in the Toronto downtown area. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more details about it.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In **section 5.1 (Data)**, the author describes the original data format, which includes intersection data, date time bins, vehicle types, and volumes. This section confirms that the dataset is related to traffic volume and is generated from a rolling window of time bins.

The paper does not provide a specific name for the dataset, but it does imply that the data is sourced from the Toronto Transit Commission. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is related to traffic volume data collected from this source.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations that might pertain to the dataset. However, the paper does not explicitly cite a dataset in the references. Instead, it refers to the data as being collected from the Toronto Transit Commission, which may not have a formal citation like other datasets.

Since the dataset is based on real traffic volume data from the Toronto downtown area, I will summarize it as follows:

1. **Traffic Volume Dataset**: This dataset includes traffic volume data collected from various intersections in downtown Toronto, with records of vehicle types and volumes aggregated over 15-minute intervals.

Although there is no formal citation for this dataset, I will acknowledge the source as the Toronto Transit Commission.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that I include the source information clearly.

After completing this process, I will have a comprehensive understanding of the dataset used in the paper, ready for any further analysis or processing.
