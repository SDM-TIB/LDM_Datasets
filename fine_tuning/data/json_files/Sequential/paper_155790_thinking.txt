To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Step Counting with Attention-based LSTM" by Shehroz S. Khan and Ali Abedi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experimental results are based on "three publicly available SC datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets and provide details about each one.

1. **WDSC Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as collected and annotated by Brajdic and Harle, which includes data from 27 subjects using an Android smartphone's accelerometer. The dataset consists of 117 samples, each labeled with the number of steps during the walk. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Brajdic, Agata, and Robert Harle. "Walk detection and step counting on unconstrained smartphones." In Proceedings of the 2013 ACM international joint conference on Pervasive and ubiquitous computing, pp. 225-234. 2013.

2. **WeAllWalk Dataset**: This dataset was collected by Flores and Manduchi from 15 subjects, including both sighted and blind individuals. It contains 932 samples categorized by the type of subject. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Flores, German H., and Roberto Manduchi. "Weallwalk: An annotated dataset of inertial sensor time series from blind walkers." ACM Transactions on Accessible Computing (TACCESS) 11, no. 1 (2018): 1-28.

3. **Pedometer Dataset**: Collected by Mattfeld et al., this dataset includes data from 30 subjects using Shimmer3 sensors. It contains 270 samples with different walking regularities. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Mattfeld, Ryan, Elliot Jesch, and Adam Hoover. "A new dataset for evaluating pedometer performance." In 2017 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM), pp. 865-869. IEEE, 2017.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately noted the details provided in the paper, including the context in which each dataset was used and any relevant statistics or characteristics mentioned.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that highlights the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ready for further processing or review.
