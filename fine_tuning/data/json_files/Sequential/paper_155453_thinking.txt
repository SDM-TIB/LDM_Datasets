To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Development of Interpretable Machine Learning Models to Detect Arrhythmia Based on ECG Data" by Shourya Verma, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study utilizes the **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database**, which is a strong lead for a dataset.

Next, I will look into the **Background section**, specifically **section 2.1**, where the author provides a detailed description of the **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database**. Here, the dataset is described as a public database consisting of a large number of ECG beats, annotated by cardiologists, and used frequently for time-series classification research. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides additional context about its structure and purpose.

In the **Methodology section**, the author discusses how the dataset was processed and utilized for training machine learning models. This further solidifies the importance of the **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database** in the research.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database**. The citation is as follows:
> George B. Moody and Roger G. Mark. *The impact of the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database*. IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine, 20(3):45â€“50, 2001.

Since the paper primarily focuses on this dataset, I will ensure to include it in my final output.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
