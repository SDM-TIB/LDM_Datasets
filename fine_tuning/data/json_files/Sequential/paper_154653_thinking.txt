To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Text2Chart: A Multi-Staged Chart Generator from Natural Language Text" by Md. Mahinur Rashid et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors constructed a dataset specifically for their problem, which indicates that there is a dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset Construction)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they created. They describe the dataset as consisting of 717 text samples collected from various sources, including Wikipedia and statistical websites. The dataset is labeled for three stages of their method, which is crucial for understanding its structure and purpose.

In this section, the authors also mention that the dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets, with specific counts for each. This information is essential for documenting the dataset's characteristics.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, since the dataset is constructed by the authors themselves, it may not have an external citation. Instead, I will note that the dataset is original and created specifically for the study.

The dataset details I will extract include:
1. **Dataset Name**: Text2Chart Dataset
2. **Description**: A dataset containing 717 text samples labeled for x-axis and y-axis entity recognition, mapping, and chart type prediction.
3. **Source**: Constructed by the authors from various sources, including Wikipedia and statistical websites.
4. **Train/Validation/Test Split**: 464 training samples, 116 validation samples, and 137 test samples.

Since the dataset is original and does not have a formal citation, I will document it as follows:

- **Text2Chart Dataset**: Original dataset created by the authors for the purpose of their research.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset details, ensuring that I include the original authorship and purpose of the dataset in my documentation.
