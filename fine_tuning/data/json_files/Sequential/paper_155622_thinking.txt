To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Language Agnostic Multilingual Streaming On-Device ASR System" by Bo Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract discusses improvements in multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) and mentions the use of a dataset consisting of speech from 9 Voice Search locales. This indicates that there is a dataset relevant to the study.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, specifically the **3.1 Data** subsection, where the authors provide detailed statistics about the dataset used. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of speech from 9 Voice Search locales, totaling 142.3 million utterances and approximately 214.2K hours of anonymized and human-transcribed data. The breakdown of utterances and hours for each language is also provided in a table format.

The languages included in the dataset are:
- English (USA)
- Chinese (Taiwan)
- French
- German
- Japanese
- Spanish (USA)
- Spanish (Spain)
- Italian
- English (UK)

Each language has a specified number of utterances and hours of speech data, which I will document.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, the dataset itself is not attributed to a specific paper or source in the references, as it appears to be an internal dataset used by Google for their Voice Search application. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is proprietary and does not have a formal citation.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring to include the relevant details such as the total number of utterances, total hours, and the breakdown by language. Since the dataset does not have a formal citation, I will indicate that it is an internal dataset from Google.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
