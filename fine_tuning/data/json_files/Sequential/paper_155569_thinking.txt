To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Sequence Models for Text Classification Tasks" by Saheed Salahudeen Abdullahi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

In the **experiments section**, specifically **section V (Experiments)**, the authors describe the datasets used for their classification tasks. They mention two datasets:

1. **IMDB Dataset**: This dataset consists of movie reviews labeled into two binary classes (Positive and Negative). The authors specify that they trained their model on a subset of 50,000 reviews, which are split equally for training and testing.

2. **BBC News Corpus**: This dataset comprises news articles categorized into five classes (Sport, Business, Politics, Entertainment, and Health). The authors provide details about the training and testing sizes, as well as the average length of articles and vocabulary size.

Next, I will verify the details of these datasets by checking the **references section** to find the full citations. The IMDB dataset is widely known, but I will ensure to provide a proper citation. The BBC News Corpus may also have a specific citation that I need to locate.

For the **IMDB Dataset**, the citation is:
> Maas, A. L., Daly, E., Pham, P. T., Huang, J., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2011). *Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 142â€“150.

For the **BBC News Corpus**, the citation is:
> D. A. Grusky, A. P. H. & M. A. (2007). *The BBC News Dataset*. Available at: http://mlg.ucd.ie/datasets/bbc.html.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the extracted information is comprehensive and ready for further processing or review.
