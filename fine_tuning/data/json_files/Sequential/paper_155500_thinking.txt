To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepRM: Deep Recurrent Matching for 6D Pose Refinement" by Alexander Avery and Andreas Savakis, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that DeepRM achieves state-of-the-art performance on two challenging datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as it is likely to contain the most relevant information about the datasets used. In **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **YCB-Video Dataset**: This dataset is described as a large-scale dataset containing 133,827 images across 92 unique scenes, with labeled 6D poses for 21 target objects. The dataset is noted for its high levels of occlusion and diverse lighting conditions.

2. **Occlusion LINEMOD Dataset**: This dataset is an extension of the original LINEMOD dataset, consisting of 13 common household objects across 13 cluttered scenes. It provides ground truth labels for all objects in one of the scenes, resulting in high levels of partial occlusion.

To ensure accuracy, I will also check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **YCB-Video Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yu Xiang, Tanner Schmidt, Venkatraman Narayanan, and Dieter Fox. *PoseCNN: A convolutional neural network for 6D object pose estimation in cluttered scenes*. ArXiv, May 2017.

- For the **Occlusion LINEMOD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Eric Brachmann, Alexander Krull, Frank Michel, Stefan Gumhold, Jamie Shotton, and Carsten Rother. *Learning 6D object pose estimation using 3D object coordinates*. In Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), volume 8690 LNCS, pages 536â€“551, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their full citations.
