To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Feature Boosting Network For 3D Pose Estimation" by Jun Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on "challenging benchmark datasets for 3D hand pose estimation and 3D full body pose estimation," which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they specifically mention two datasets:

1. **3DHandPose Dataset**: This dataset is described as a large dataset for 3D hand pose estimation, containing 30,000 training images and 6,000 testing images, with annotations for 21 keypoints of the human hand.

2. **Human3.6M Dataset**: This is a well-known dataset for 3D human body pose estimation, containing 3.6 million poses captured with a motion capture system. The authors follow a specific evaluation protocol using data from five subjects for training and two for testing.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of these datasets:

- For the **3DHandPose Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Zhang, J. Jiao, M. Chen, L. Qu, X. Xu, and Q. Yang. *A hand pose tracking benchmark from stereo matching*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Image Processing, pages 982–986, 2017.

- For the **Human3.6M Dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. Ionescu, D. Papava, V. Olaru, and C. Sminchisescu. *Human3.6M: Large scale datasets and predictive methods for 3D human sensing in natural environments*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 36(7):1325–1339, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
