To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning with Chromatic Networks for Compact Architecture Search" by Xingyou Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses a neural architecture search algorithm but does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup and may reference specific datasets used for training and evaluation.

I will also look for a dedicated **datasets section** if available, as it often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the paper does not have a dedicated section, I will check the **methodology** or **results** sections for any mentions of datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used the **OpenAI Gym** environments for their experiments, I will note that down. The citation for OpenAI Gym is:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. H., Schneider, J., & Schulman, J. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

If they mention any specific tasks or environments from OpenAI Gym, I will ensure to document those as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
