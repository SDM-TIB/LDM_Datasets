To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pointer-Guided Pre-Training: Infusing Large Language Models with Paragraph-Level Contextual Awareness" by Lars Hillebrand et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on a diverse set of datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names and descriptions of these datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of representation learning for paragraph-level contextual understanding, which may lead to mentions of specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors outline their experiments and describe the datasets used. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

Upon reviewing section 4.2, I find the following datasets mentioned for evaluation:

1. **CSAbstruct Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,189 computer science abstracts with sentences annotated to discern their rhetorical roles.

2. **PubMed-RCT Dataset**: This dataset includes 20,000 biomedical abstracts from PubMed, segmented into five rhetorical categories.

3. **Nicta Dataset**: Comprising 1,000 biomedical abstracts, this dataset classifies sentences according to the PICO framework (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome).

4. **GRIDE Dataset**: This dataset contains 92 sustainability reports from leading German companies, annotated according to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards.

5. **IFRSEN Dataset**: Composed of 45 English annual reports, this dataset includes annotations that map paragraphs to 543 distinct legal requirements.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. 

- For the **CSAbstruct Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cohan, A., Beltagy, I., King, D., Dalvi, B., Weld, D. (2019). *Pretrained language models for sequential sentence classification*. In Proceedings of the EMNLP.

- For the **PubMed-RCT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dernoncourt, F., Lee, J.Y. (2017). *PubMed 200k RCT: a dataset for sequential sentence classification in medical abstracts*. In Proceedings of the IJCNLP.

- For the **Nicta Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jin, D., Szolovits, P. (2018). *Hierarchical neural networks for sequential sentence classification in medical scientific abstracts*. In Proceedings of the EMNLP.

- For the **GRIDE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hillebrand, L., Pielka, M., Leonhard, D., Deußer, T., Dilmaghani, T., Kliem, B., Loitz, R., Morad, M., Temath, C., Bell, T., Stenzel, R., Sifa, R. (2023). *Sustain.ai: a recommender system to analyze sustainability reports*. In Proceedings of the ICAIL.

- For the **IFRSEN Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hillebrand, L., Deußer, T., Dilmaghani, T., Kliem, B., Loitz, R., Bauckhage, C., Sifa, R. (2022). *KPI-BERT: A joint named entity recognition and relation extraction model for financial reports*. In Proceedings of the ICPR.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or processing.
