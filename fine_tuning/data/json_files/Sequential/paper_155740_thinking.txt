To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Case Study of Chinese Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Reviews Based on LSTM" by Lukai Wang and Lei Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the dataset was obtained from **Sina Weibo** using a web crawler, which suggests that this is a primary dataset used in the study.

Next, I will examine the **Research Design and Data Collection** section, as it is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used. Here, the authors mention that they collected a corpus of **8,027 positive and 8,703 negative reviews** related to the **Tangshan attack** and **Jiang Ge case**. This indicates that there are two distinct datasets based on these events.

I will also look for any additional details about the datasets, such as how they were processed or any specific characteristics that might be relevant for citation. The authors describe the **Tangshan case dataset** as consisting of **7,004 positive reviews and 2,009 negative reviews**, while the **Jiang Ge case dataset** consists of **13,597 positive reviews and 9,633 negative reviews**. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' composition.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from social media reviews and not published datasets, I will cite the source of the data collection, which is **Sina Weibo**. I will note that the datasets are not formally published but are based on user-generated content from this platform.

The citations for the datasets will be as follows:

1. **Tangshan Case Dataset**: 
   > Wang, L., & Wang, L. (2023). A Case Study of Chinese Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Reviews Based on LSTM. *Department of Plasma Physics and Fusion Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China*.

2. **Jiang Ge Case Dataset**: 
   > Wang, L., & Wang, L. (2023). A Case Study of Chinese Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Reviews Based on LSTM. *Department of Plasma Physics and Fusion Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China*.

Since both datasets are part of the same study, I will reference the same citation for both.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include all relevant details and citations for each dataset, ready for structured output.
