To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FarsTail: A Persian Natural Language Inference Dataset" by Hossein Amirkhani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the creation of a new dataset called **FarsTail**, which is specifically designed for the Natural Language Inference (NLI) task in the Persian language. This indicates that FarsTail is the primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **related work** section, particularly in **section 2**. Here, the authors discuss various existing NLI datasets, including:

1. **SciTail**: This dataset is referenced as a similar dataset to FarsTail, which provides context for understanding the development of FarsTail. The citation for SciTail is:
   > Khot, T., Sabharwal, A., & Clark, P. (2018). SciTail: A textual entailment dataset from science question answering. In *Thirty-Second AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence* (pp. 5189â€“5197).

2. **ParsiNLU**: Another dataset mentioned in the context of Persian language understanding, which includes an NLI set. The citation for ParsiNLU is:
   > Khashabi, D., Cohan, A., Shakeri, S., Hosseini, P., Pezeshkpour, P., Alikhani, M., Aminnaseri, M., Bitaab, M., Brahman, F., Ghazarian, S., et al. (2020). ParsiNLU: A suite of language understanding challenges for Persian. arXiv preprint arXiv:2012.06154.

In the **experiments** section, the authors evaluate various models on the FarsTail dataset, but they do not introduce any new datasets at this point. Therefore, I will focus on the datasets identified earlier.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset. The primary dataset is **FarsTail**, and the related datasets are **SciTail** and **ParsiNLU**.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset information, ensuring that the citations are accurate and complete for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
