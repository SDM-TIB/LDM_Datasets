To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SimpleBooks: Long-term dependency book dataset with simplified English vocabulary for word-level language modeling" by Huyen Nguyen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces **SimpleBooks**, which is a dataset created from 1,573 Gutenberg books. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used in the research. In this case, the **section 2 (SimpleBooks dataset)** provides a comprehensive description of the dataset, including its size, token count, and vocabulary size. Here, I find that **SimpleBooks-92** contains 92 million tokens and **SimpleBooks-2** contains 2 million tokens. Both datasets are derived from the same source but differ in size and vocabulary.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm that these datasets were used in the experiments conducted in the paper. The experiments section mentions training language models on both **SimpleBooks-2** and **SimpleBooks-92**, confirming their relevance to the research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the original source of the books used to create the datasets, which is the **Gutenberg Project**. However, it does not provide a formal citation for the datasets themselves. Therefore, I will create a citation based on the information provided in the paper:

- For **SimpleBooks-92** and **SimpleBooks-2**, I will cite them as follows:
  > Huyen Nguyen. *SimpleBooks: Long-term dependency book dataset with simplified English vocabulary for word-level language modeling*. Available at: https://dldata-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/simplebooks.zip.

Since the datasets are derived from the same source, I will ensure to mention that they are part of the same dataset family.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured output for further processing or review.
