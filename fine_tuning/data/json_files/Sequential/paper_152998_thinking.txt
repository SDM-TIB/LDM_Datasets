To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Word Usage Similarity Estimation with Sentence Representations and Automatic Substitutes" by Aina Garí Soler et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of "benchmark datasets addressing both graded and binary similarity," which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Usim Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the SemEval-2007 Lexical Substitution task and contains instances of target words in context, annotated with meaning-preserving substitutes and graded pairwise Usim judgments. The authors specify that they use 2,466 sentence pairs from this dataset for their experiments.

2. **Concepts in Context (CoInCo) Corpus**: This dataset is a subset of the MASC corpus and contains manually selected substitutes for all content words in a sentence. The authors describe how they constructed supplementary training data from this corpus.

3. **Word-in-Context (WiC) Dataset**: This dataset provides pairs of contextualized target word instances for a binary classification task. The authors mention that it contains 7,618 training pairs, 702 development pairs, and 1,366 test pairs.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Usim Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Erk, K., McCarthy, D., & Gaylord, N. (2013). Measuring word meaning in context. *Computational Linguistics*, 39(3), 511-554.

- For the **Concepts in Context Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Kremer, G., Erk, K., Padó, S., & Thater, S. (2014). What substitutes tell us - analysis of an “all-words” lexical substitution corpus. In *Proceedings of the 14th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics*, pages 540–549.

- For the **Word-in-Context (WiC) Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pilehvar, M. T., & Camacho-Collados, J. (2019). WiC: 10,000 Example Pairs for Evaluating Context-Sensitive Representations. In *Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies*.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
