To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Abstractive Text Summarization with Sequence-to-Sequence Models" by Tian Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is significant to their work.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used for their experiments:

1. **CNN/Daily Mail Dataset**: This dataset consists of over 300,000 news articles paired with multi-sentence highlights. The authors provide a link to the dataset's repository, which is useful for verification and further details.

2. **Newsroom Dataset**: This dataset contains 1.3 million article-summary pairs, with a significant portion available for training and evaluation. The authors also provide a link to the dataset's source.

3. **Bytecup Dataset**: This dataset is from the Byte Cup 2018 International Machine Learning Contest and consists of 1.3 million articles, with a portion designated for training.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide statistics for each dataset, which helps confirm their relevance and usage in the study.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for these datasets:

- For the **CNN/Daily Mail Dataset**, the citation is:
  > See, A., Liu, P. J., & Manning, C. D. (2017). Get To The Point: Summarization with Pointer-Generator Networks. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers). Association for Computational Linguistics, 1073–1083.

- For the **Newsroom Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Bytecup Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Byte Cup 2018 International Machine Learning Contest. Retrieved from https://www.biendata.com/competition/bytecup2018/.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately represented for future reference or analysis.
