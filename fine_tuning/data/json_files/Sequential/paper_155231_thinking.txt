To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Gated Memory Recurrent Network for Efficient Scalable HDR Deghosting" by K Ram Prabhakar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method is evaluated on **three publicly available datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the introduction, the authors mention the challenges of capturing ground truth HDR images and the need for datasets that include both static and dynamic sequences. This implies that the datasets used are likely to be related to HDR imaging and deghosting.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for training and validation:

1. **Kalantari17 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 74 training sequences and 15 validation sequences, each containing three varying exposure images. The citation for this dataset is:
   > N. K. Kalantari and R. Ramamoorthi. *Deep high dynamic range imaging of dynamic scenes*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (Proceedings of SIGGRAPH 2017), vol. 36, no. 4, 2017.

2. **Prabhakar19 Dataset**: This dataset includes 466 training sequences and 116 validation sequences, also with three varying exposure images. The citation for this dataset is:
   > K. R. Prabhakar, R. Arora, A. Swaminathan, K. P. Singh, and R. V. Babu. *A fast, scalable, and reliable deghosting method for extreme exposure fusion*. In 2019 IEEE International Conference on Computational Photography (ICCP), pages 1–8, 2019.

3. **METU Dataset**: This dataset is used for validating scalability performance and consists of sequences with 7 LDR images. The citation for this dataset is:
   > O. T. Tursun, A. O. Akyüz, A. Erdem, and E. Erdem. *An objective deghosting quality metric for HDR images*. In Computer Graphics Forum, vol. 35, no. 2, Wiley Online Library, 2016, pp. 139–152.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. Each dataset will be described with its purpose and the relevant citation.

After completing this process, I will have a comprehensive list of datasets extracted from the paper, along with their full citations, ready for further processing or review.
