To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Feature-level and Model-level Audiovisual Fusion for Emotion Recognition in the Wild" by Jie Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that experimental results were obtained on the **EmotiW2018 AFEW dataset**, which indicates that this is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this case, the **experiments section (4.1)** explicitly states that the proposed fusion methods were evaluated on the **Acted Facial Expressions in the Wild (AFEW)** dataset. This section provides a detailed description of the dataset, including its composition and labeling.

The AFEW dataset is described as consisting of short video clips collected from movies and TV shows, with labels for seven different emotions. This detailed description confirms its significance in the research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the AFEW dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> A. Dhall, R. Goecke, S. Lucey, T. Gedeon, et al. Collecting large, richly annotated facial-expression databases from movies. *IEEE Multimedia*, 19(3):34â€“41, 2012.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will focus on the AFEW dataset for my extraction.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
