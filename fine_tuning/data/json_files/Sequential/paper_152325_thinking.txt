To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unitary Evolution Recurrent Neural Networks" by Martin Arjovsky et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets used in prior work.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments on tasks such as the copying memory problem, the adding problem, and pixel-by-pixel MNIST classification. I will check if they mention any datasets associated with these tasks. For example, the MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset for image classification tasks, and it is likely that they used it in their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For instance, if the authors mention using the MNIST dataset, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation for the MNIST dataset is typically:
> Yann LeCun, LÃ©on Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 1998.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and experiments sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Identify specific datasets used in the experiments.
3. Check the references for full citations of each dataset.
4. Compile the dataset information, including names, descriptions, and citations, for clarity and proper attribution.
