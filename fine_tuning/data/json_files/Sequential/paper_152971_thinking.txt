To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long Short-Term Memory with Gate and State Level Fusion for Light Field-Based Face Recognition" by Alireza Sepas-Moghaddam et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **IST-EURECOM Light Field Face Database (LFFD)** for performance assessment, indicating that this is a key dataset.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions in the **experiments section**. Here, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the **IST-EURECOM LFFD dataset**, stating that it consists of 4000 LF images captured from 100 subjects, with various facial variations. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use in the experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The citation for the **IST-EURECOM LFFD dataset** is:
> A. Sepas-Moghaddam, V. Chiesa, P. Correia, F. Pereira, and J. Dugelay. "The IST-EURECOM light field face database." In International Workshop on Biometrics and Forensics, Coventry, UK, April 2017.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify the dataset.
2. Confirm the dataset details in the experiments section.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references section.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture the necessary information about the dataset used in the research paper.
