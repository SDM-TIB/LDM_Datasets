To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Label Transfer Learning for Multi-Relational Semantic Similarity" by Li Zhang, Steven R. Wilson, and Rada Mihalcea, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on multiple semantic similarity datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they describe three datasets:

1. **Human Activity Phrase Dataset**: This dataset consists of pairs of phrases regarding human activities, annotated with four different relations: Similarity (SIM), Relatedness (REL), Motivational Alignment (MA), and Perceived Actor Congruence (PAC). The dataset includes 1,000 pairs, with an additional 1,373 pairs from a supplemental source.

2. **SICK Dataset**: The Sentences Involving Compositional Knowledge benchmark includes a large number of sentence pairs annotated for relatedness and entailment. It consists of 4,439 pairs in the training split, 495 in the trial split, and 4,906 in the test split.

3. **Typed-Similarity Dataset**: This dataset contains metadata describing cultural heritage items, annotated on eight dimensions of similarity. It includes 750 pairs in the training split, with 500 for training and 250 for development, and 721 in the test split.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Human Activity Phrase Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Steven Wilson and Rada Mihalcea. *Measuring semantic relations between human activities*. In Proceedings of the Eighth International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 664–673, Taipei, Taiwan, 2017.

- For the **SICK Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marco Marelli, Luisa Bentivogli, Marco Baroni, Raffaella Bernardi, Stefano Menini, and Roberto Zamparelli. *A sick cure for the evaluation of compositional distributional semantic models*. In Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’14), pages 216–223, Reykjavik, Iceland, 2014.

- For the **Typed-Similarity Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Eneko Agirre, Nikolaos Aletras, Aitor Gonzalez-Agirre, German Rigau, and Mark Stevenson. *Ubc_uos-typed: Regression for typed-similarity*. In Second Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (*SEM), Volume 1: Proceedings of the Main Conference and the Shared Task: Semantic Textual Similarity, pages 132–137, Atlanta, Georgia, USA, 2013.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
