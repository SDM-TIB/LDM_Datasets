To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Elastic bands across the path: A new framework and method to lower bound DTW" by Chang Wei Tan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. This is where the authors usually describe the datasets they used for their experiments, including any specific characteristics or details about the datasets.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets like the **UCR time series archive**, which is referenced multiple times throughout the paper. The authors discuss their experiments using various datasets from this archive, which is crucial for my extraction.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important as it provides the necessary context and credit for the datasets used in the research.

For example, I will look for the following datasets:

1. **UCR Time Series Classification Archive**: This is a well-known dataset used for time series classification tasks. I will find the citation for this archive, which is likely to be:
   > Chen, Y., Keogh, E., Hu, B., Begum, N., Bagnall, A., Mueen, A., & Batista, G. (2015). The UCR Time Series Classification Archive. Retrieved from www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data/.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets mentioned in the paper while providing proper attribution.
