To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Relation Extraction Using Large Language Models: A Case Study on Acupuncture Point Locations" by Yiming Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study utilizes the **World Health Organization Standard Acupuncture Point Locations in the Western Pacific Region (WHO Standard)** as the corpus for their research. This suggests that this dataset is central to the study.

Next, I will examine the **Materials and Methods** section, where the authors describe their data source in detail. Here, they explicitly mention the **WHO Standard**, which consists of descriptions of **361 acupoints** and outlines the methodology for locating these acupoints. This section confirms that the WHO Standard is indeed the dataset used for their experiments.

In the **Results** and **Discussion** sections, the authors discuss their findings based on the data from the WHO Standard, further validating its significance in their research. They also mention the number of annotated relations (3,174) derived from this dataset, which provides additional context about its use.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the WHO Standard dataset. The citation is as follows:
> World Health Organization. *WHO Standard Acupuncture Point Locations in the Western Pacific Region*. 2008.

Since the WHO Standard is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format.

I will summarize the dataset details, including its name, description, and citation, ensuring that I provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the study. This will be crucial for anyone looking to reference or utilize the dataset in future research.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
