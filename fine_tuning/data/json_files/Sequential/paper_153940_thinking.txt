To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Rank Learning Curves" by Martin Wistuba and Tejaswini Pedapati, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the method's application to various datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using **five different datasets** for their analysis: **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Fashion-MNIST, Quickdraw, and SVHN**. I will note these names as they are crucial for the dataset entries.

I will then look for **specific details about each dataset** in the text. The authors provide a brief description of how they utilized these datasets, including the number of classes and data points for Quickdraw, which has 50 million data points and 345 classes, but they selected a subset for their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

The citations I will extract are as follows:

1. **CIFAR-10**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset of images*. 2009. URL: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

2. **CIFAR-100**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-100: The CIFAR-100 dataset of images*. 2009. URL: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

3. **Fashion-MNIST**:
   > Zalando Research. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. 2017. URL: https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist.

4. **Quickdraw**:
   > Google. *Quick, Draw! Dataset*. 2017. URL: https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data.

5. **SVHN**:
   > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), 2011. URL: http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
