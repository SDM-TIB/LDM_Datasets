To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identifying False Content and Hate Speech in Sinhala YouTube Videos by Analyzing the Audio" by W. A. K. M. Wickramaarachchi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information and provide full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals, but the methodology section is likely where the datasets are explicitly detailed.

In the **methodology section**, specifically under **section III (Datasets)**, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **OpenSLR/SLR52 Dataset**: This dataset is used for automatic speech recognition and contains over 185,000 Sinhala audio samples with corresponding transcriptions.

2. **Sinhala-Unicode-Hate-Speech Kaggle Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for hate speech detection and includes more than 6000 sentences labeled for the presence of hate speech.

3. **Hamza-Ziyard/CNN-Daily-Mail-Sinhala Dataset**: This dataset is used for sentence summarization and consists of over 5000 Sinhala sentences with their summaries.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **OpenSLR/SLR52 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Huggingface.co, "openslr Datasets at Hugging Face," [Online]. Available: https://huggingface.co/datasets/openslr/viewer/SLR52/train. [Accessed 14 August 2023].

- For the **Sinhala-Unicode-Hate-Speech Kaggle Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kaggle, "Sinhala Unicode Hate Speech," [Online]. Available: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sahanjayasuriya/sinhala-unicode-hate-speech. [Accessed 14 August 2023].

- For the **Hamza-Ziyard/CNN-Daily-Mail-Sinhala Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Huggingface.co, "Hamza-Ziyard/CNN-Daily-Mail-Sinhala Datasets at Hugging Face," [Online]. Available: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Hamza-Ziyard/CNN-Daily-Mail-Sinhala. [Accessed 14 August 2023].

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details are captured and properly attributed.
