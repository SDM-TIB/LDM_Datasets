To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Few-shot Named Entity Recognition with Self-describing Networks" by Jiawei Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **8 benchmarks from different domains**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **CoNLL2003**: This dataset is a well-known benchmark for named entity recognition tasks.
2. **WNUT17**: This dataset is used for novel and emerging entity recognition.
3. **Re3d**: A dataset related to defense and military contexts.
4. **MIT corpus**: This includes three datasets: Res, Movie1, and Movie2, which are used for review-related tasks.
5. **I2B2**: A dataset focused on clinical narratives.
6. **OntoNotes5**: A comprehensive dataset for various NLP tasks.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations for future use or verification.
