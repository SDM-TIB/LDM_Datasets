To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dravidian-CodeMix-HASOC-FIRE2020: Pre-training ULMFiT on Synthetically Generated Code-Mixed Data for Hate Speech Detection" by Gaurav Arora, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a code-mixed dataset of comments/posts in Dravidian languages collected from social media, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors describe the tasks and the nature of the dataset. They mention that the dataset is annotated with offensive/not-offensive labels and is collected from YouTube comments and tweets. This provides a good indication of the dataset's source and purpose.

I will then look into **section 3.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide specific details about the Dravidian code-mix HASOC classification dataset. They mention that the dataset is used for two sub-tasks: Sub-task A (mixed-script Malayalam) and Sub-task B (Roman script Tamil and Malayalam). The dataset statistics are provided, including the number of examples and class distribution, which are crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

In the **References section**, I will search for any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The authors reference previous works that may provide context or additional information about the datasets used. However, the primary dataset is the Dravidian code-mix HASOC dataset, which is central to their experiments.

The full citation for the dataset is as follows:
> B. R. Chakravarthi, M. A. Kumar, J. P. McCrae, P. B, S. KP, T. Mandl. *Overview of the track on HASOC - Offensive Language Identification - DravidianCodemix*. In: Working Notes of the Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation (FIRE 2020). CEUR Workshop Proceedings. In: CEUR-WS. org, Hyderabad, India, 2020.

Now, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Dravidian Code-Mix HASOC Dataset**: This dataset is used for hate speech detection in code-mixed comments/posts in Dravidian languages (Tamil-English and Malayalam-English). It includes annotations for offensive and non-offensive content and is collected from social media platforms like YouTube and Twitter.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
