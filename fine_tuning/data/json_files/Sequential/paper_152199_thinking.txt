To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Outrageously Large Neural Networks: The Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts Layer" by Noam Shazeer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the application of the proposed method to language modeling and machine translation tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, the authors mention two primary datasets:

1. **1 Billion Word Language Modeling Benchmark**: This dataset is introduced by Chelba et al. (2013) and consists of shuffled unique sentences from news articles, totaling approximately 829 million words. This dataset is crucial for evaluating language models.

2. **100 Billion Word Google News Corpus**: This dataset consists of shuffled unique sentences from Google’s internal news corpus, totaling roughly 100 billion words. It is used to test the scalability of the proposed models.

I will also check the **machine translation section** (Section 5.3) where the authors mention datasets used for benchmarking their method. They refer to the **WMT’14 En→Fr and En→De corpora**, which contain 36 million and 5 million sentence pairs, respectively.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **1 Billion Word Language Modeling Benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Ciprian Chelba, Tomas Mikolov, Mike Schuster, Qi Ge, Thorsten Brants, Phillipp Koehn, and Tony Robinson. *One billion word benchmark for measuring progress in statistical language modeling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.3005, 2013.

- For the **WMT’14 En→Fr and En→De corpora**, the citation is:
  > Melvin Johnson, Mike Schuster, Quoc V. Le, Maxim Krikun, Yonghui Wu, Zhifeng Chen, Nikhil Thorat, Fernanda B. Viégas, Martin Wattenberg, Greg Corrado, Macduff Hughes, and Jeffrey Dean. *Google’s multilingual neural machine translation system: Enabling zero-shot translation*. CoRR, abs/1611.04558, 2016.

- For the **100 Billion Word Google News Corpus**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation, it is generally referenced in the context of Google's internal datasets and may not have a formal citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the information extracted from the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
