To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine Learning for Postprocessing Ensemble Streamflow Forecasts" by Sanjib Sharma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the integration of numerical weather prediction ensembles and a distributed hydrological model, which suggests that datasets related to weather predictions and hydrological observations may be present. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of ensemble prediction systems and mentions the use of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Global Ensemble Forecast System Reforecast version 2 (GEFSRv2) as a forcing dataset.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **Methods and Materials**. In this section, the authors describe the use of the GEFSRv2 dataset to generate raw ensemble streamflow forecasts. They also mention using daily streamflow observations from the US Geological Survey (USGS) at a specific gage station (USGS 01510000) for verification purposes.

I will note the following datasets:

1. **GEFSRv2 (Global Ensemble Forecast System Reforecast version 2)**: This dataset is used to force the hydrological model and generate ensemble streamflow forecasts. It is an 11-member ensemble forecast generated by perturbing the NWP model initial conditions.

2. **USGS Daily Streamflow Observations**: These observations are used to verify the raw and postprocessed ensemble streamflow forecasts. The specific gage station mentioned is USGS 01510000, located in the Upper Susquehanna River basin.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper:

- For **GEFSRv2**, the citation is:
  > Hamill, T.M., Bates, G.T., Whitaker, J.S., Murray, D.R., Fiorino, M., Galarneau, T.J., Zhu, Y., & Lapenta, W. (2013). NOAAâ€™s Second-Generation Global Medium-Range Ensemble Reforecast Dataset. Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. https://doi.org/10.1175/bams-d-12-00014.1

- For **USGS Daily Streamflow Observations**, the citation is:
  > Gitro, C.M., Evans, M.S., & Grumm, R.H. (2014). Two Major Heavy Rain/Flood Events in the Mid-Atlantic: June 2006 and September 2011. Journal of Operational Meteorology 2.

With these datasets identified and their citations noted, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing or review.
