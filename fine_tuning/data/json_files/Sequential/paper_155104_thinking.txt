To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Remember Patterns: Pattern Matching Memory Networks for Traffic Forecasting" by Hyunwook Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their model on traffic forecasting, which suggests that datasets are involved, but it does not specify which ones.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any references to datasets. Here, the authors discuss the challenges of traffic forecasting and mention various models, but they do not name specific datasets yet.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4 (Evaluation)**, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets used for evaluation. The authors state that they used two datasets for their experiments: **METR-LA** and **NAVER-Seoul**. 

1. **METR-LA Dataset**: The paper describes this dataset as containing 4-month speed data from 207 sensors on Los Angeles highways. This dataset is crucial for evaluating the proposed model.

2. **NAVER-Seoul Dataset**: This dataset consists of 3-month speed data collected from 774 links in Seoul, Korea. The authors note that this dataset presents a more challenging scenario due to its complex urban traffic patterns.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. 

- For the **METR-LA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yaguang Li, Rose Yu, Cyrus Shahabi, and Yan Liu. *Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network: Data-Driven Traffic Forecasting*. In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2018.

- For the **NAVER-Seoul Dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. Lee, Y. Kim, S. Jin, D. Kim, R. Maciejewski, D. Ebert, and S. Ko. *A Visual Analytics System for Exploring, Monitoring, and Forecasting Road Traffic Congestion*. IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 26(11):3133â€“3146, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
