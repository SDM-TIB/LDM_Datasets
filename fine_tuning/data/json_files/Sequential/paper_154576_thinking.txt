To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Attention Based Neural Network for Code Switching Detection: English & Roman Urdu" by Aizaz Hussain and Muhammad Umair Arshad, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present a new public dataset for code-mixed language identification, which suggests that there is a dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **corpora section (Section 4)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their research. They mention that they collected data from Twitter, including English and Roman Urdu tweets, and also used an English dictionary. They specifically state that they targeted both Aryan Urdu and Roman Urdu tweets, which were converted into Roman Urdu.

In this section, the authors provide details about the dataset preparation, including challenges faced in data collection, such as informal language and misspellings. They also mention the size of the datasets, which is crucial for understanding the scale of their research.

The paper lists the following datasets:

1. **English Vocabulary Dataset**: This dataset consists of 466,000 words sourced from an English dictionary.
2. **English Chat Dataset**: This dataset contains approximately 1 million sentences scraped from Twitter, representing informal English chat.
3. **Roman Urdu Dataset**: This dataset includes Roman Urdu tokens, which were collected from Twitter and consist of about 0.05 million tokens.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are derived from publicly available resources and the authors' own collection efforts.

For the English Vocabulary Dataset, I can reference the source:
- > "English Words Dataset." Available at: https://github.com/dwyl/english-words

For the English Chat Dataset and Roman Urdu Dataset, since they are based on the authors' own collection from Twitter and do not have formal citations, I will note that they are derived from Twitter data and the authors' preprocessing efforts.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include the relevant details and citations as needed for clarity and completeness.
