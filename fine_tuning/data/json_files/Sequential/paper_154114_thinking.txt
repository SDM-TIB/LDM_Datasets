To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Hierarchical User Intention-Habit Extract Network for Credit Loan Overdue Risk Detection" by Hao Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on two datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe the datasets used. In this section, they mention two datasets: **DataA** and **DataB**. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets, including their composition and the context in which they were used.

In **Section 5.1 (Dataset)**, the authors provide a clear description of the datasets:
1. **DataA**: This dataset includes both old and new data from Bank A. The old dataset contains only profile features, while the new dataset includes both profile features and sequence features after the mobile banking app was updated.
2. **DataB**: Similar to DataA, this dataset consists of old and new data from Bank B, with the same distinctions regarding profile and sequence features.

I will also note the sample sizes for each dataset as provided in **Table 1** of the paper, which details the number of samples for negative and positive cases.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are derived from specific banks and not publicly available datasets, they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets. Instead, I will summarize the information as follows:

- **DataA**: Old dataset from Bank A (profile features only) and new dataset from Bank A (profile and sequence features).
- **DataB**: Old dataset from Bank B (profile features only) and new dataset from Bank B (profile and sequence features).

Since these datasets are proprietary and do not have formal citations, I will note that they are referenced as internal datasets from Bank A and Bank B.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and any relevant details, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the representation of the datasets used in the research.
