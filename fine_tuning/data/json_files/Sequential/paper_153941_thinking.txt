To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention and Encoder-Decoder based models for transforming articulatory movements at different speaking rates" by Abhayjeet Singh et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not contain specific dataset details. The introduction may reference prior work or datasets, but the **Dataset section** is likely where the authors will provide explicit details about the datasets used.

In **section 2 (Dataset)**, the authors describe the dataset they collected, which consists of articulatory data for 460 sentences spoken at three different rates: neutral, fast, and slow. They mention that this data was collected from 5 subjects, including both male and female participants, and that the sentences were phonetically balanced and sourced from the MOCHA-TIMIT corpus. This section provides essential details about the dataset, including the number of sentences, subjects, and the method of data collection.

Next, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the MOCHA-TIMIT corpus, which is crucial for providing the correct citation. I will check the **References section** to find the complete citation for the MOCHA-TIMIT corpus.

The citation for the MOCHA-TIMIT corpus is:
> A. Wrench, “Mocha-TIMIT speech database,” The 18th International Conference on Pattern Recognition, 1999.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MOCHA-TIMIT corpus as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured and cited.
