To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Point Cloud based Hierarchical Deep Odometry Estimation" by Farzan Erlik Nowruzi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of point cloud data for odometry estimation, which suggests that a specific dataset may be utilized.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data Pre-Processing)**, where the authors explicitly mention using the **KITTI dataset** for their experiments. This section provides details about how the dataset is processed, indicating its significance in the research.

In this section, the authors describe the characteristics of the KITTI dataset, including its use of global pose coordinates and the number of points per frame. They also mention the pre-processing steps taken to prepare the data for their deep odometry model.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the KITTI dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2012.

Since the paper primarily discusses the KITTI dataset, I will create an entry for it, ensuring to include the full citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included.
