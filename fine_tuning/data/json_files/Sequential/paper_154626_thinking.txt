To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HAConvGNN: Hierarchical Attention Based Convolutional Graph Neural Network for Code Documentation Generation in Jupyter Notebooks" by Dakuo Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their model on a new corpus constructed from well-documented Kaggle notebooks, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (notebookCDG Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset they constructed. They mention that the dataset contains around **28,625 processed code-documentation pairs** extracted from **2,476 highly-ranked notebooks from Kaggle competitions**. This section provides essential details about the dataset, including its size and the source of the data.

In this section, the authors also explain their data collection process, emphasizing that they used the top 10% of highly-voted notebooks from popular Kaggle competitions. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and quality.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference their own work regarding the dataset construction, which is as follows:

- For the **notebookCDG dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dakuo Wang, April Yi Wang, Xuye Liu, and Lingfei Wu. *Constructing a Dataset for Code Documentation Generation in Computational Notebooks*. In Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pages 1-7, 2021.

This citation is important as it provides the necessary details for anyone interested in accessing or referencing the dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that all relevant details are captured for future reference or processing.
