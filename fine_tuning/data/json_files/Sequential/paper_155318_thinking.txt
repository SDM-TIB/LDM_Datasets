To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BERT-LID: Leveraging BERT to Improve Spoken Language Identification" by Yuting Nie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and results, but the **experiments section** is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used.

In **section 4.2 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly list three datasets used in their experiments:

1. **OLR20**: This dataset is described as a multilingual dataset containing six languages, with an average segment length of 5.45 seconds.

2. **T&T**: This dataset is a combination of the THCHS-30 (Chinese) and TIMIT (English) datasets, which has been modified to create short-length segments by chopping all sentences into one-second speech fragments.

3. **TAL ASR**: This dataset is collected from English classes taught in Chinese, containing many instances of code-switching between Chinese and English.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **OLR20**, the citation is:
  > Z. Li, M. Zhao, Q. Hong, L. Li, Z. Tang, D. Wang, L. Song, and C. Yang. *AP20-OLR Challenge: Three Tasks and Their Baselines*. In Proceedings of APSIPA ASC, pages 550â€“555, 2020.

- For **THCHS-30**, the citation is:
  > D. Wang and X. Zhang. *THCHS-30: A Free Chinese Speech Corpus*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.01882, 2015.

- For **TIMIT**, the citation is:
  > J. S. Garofolo, L. F. Lamel, W. M. Fisher, J. G. Fiscus, and D. S. Pallett. *DARPA TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus CD-ROM*. NASA STI/Recon Technical Report N, vol. 93, p. 27403, 1993.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the study along with their proper citations.
