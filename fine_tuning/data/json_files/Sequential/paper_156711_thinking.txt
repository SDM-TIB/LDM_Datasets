To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning Calabi-Yau four folds with hybrid and recurrent neural network architectures" by H. L. Dao, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the application of deep learning to a dataset of almost one million complete intersection Calabi-Yau four-folds (CICY4), which indicates that a significant dataset is involved. The introduction further elaborates on the context of the study, specifically mentioning the CICY4 dataset and its relevance to machine learning in string theory.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Dataset and data preparation)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the dataset. In subsection 2.1, the author provides an overview of the CICY4 dataset, stating that it contains 921,497 data points, each consisting of a configuration matrix and associated topological properties, including four Hodge numbers. This section also references the original compilation of the dataset, which is crucial for citation purposes.

I will also note that the dataset was introduced in the works of [28] and [24]. To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of these works.

The relevant citations for the datasets are:

1. For the **CICY4 dataset**, the citation is:
   > J. Gray, A. S. Haupt, and A. Lukas. *All Complete Intersection Calabi-Yau Four-Folds*. JHEP 07 (2013), p. 070, arXiv: 1303.1832 [hep-th].

2. The original work that compiled the dataset is:
   > H. Erbin, R. Finotello. *Deep multi-task mining Calabi-Yau four-folds*. arXiv:2108.02221v2, Mach. Learn.: Sci. Technol. (2021).

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, including its size, structure, and any relevant characteristics, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
