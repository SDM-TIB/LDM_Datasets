To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The DeepZen Speech Synthesis System for Blizzard Challenge 2023" by Christophe Veaux et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the study. The abstract mentions participation in two tasks: a hub task with a large monospeaker dataset and a spoke task with a smaller dataset. This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors describe the requirements for both tasks. They specify that the hub task involves about 50 hours of data from a French female speaker and the spoke task involves about 2 hours of data from another French female speaker. This gives me a clear indication of the datasets used.

Moving on to the **data processing and training strategy** sections, I will look for specific names of the datasets. The authors mention using the "Siwis dataset" for the hub task, which is further described as containing subsets from another French female speaker. They also mention an internal dataset for the spoke task, which consists of about 15 hours of data from three French female speakers.

Now, I will compile the details of the datasets:

1. **Siwis Dataset**: This dataset is used for the hub task and consists of approximately 50 hours of data from a target French female speaker, along with subsets from another French female speaker.

2. **Internal Dataset**: This dataset is used for the spoke task and contains about 15 hours of data from three French female speakers.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following:

- For the **Siwis Dataset**, the citation is:
  > P.-E. Honnet, A. Lazaridis, P. N. Garner, and J. Yamagishi. "The Siwis French Speech Synthesis Database: Design and Recording of a High Quality French Database for Speech Synthesis." 2017.

Since the internal dataset is not publicly available, it does not have a formal citation.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets with their respective citations, ensuring that I have captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a clear and concise overview of the datasets used in the research.
