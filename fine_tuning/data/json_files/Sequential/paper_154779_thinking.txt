To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine learning models for DOTA 2 outcomes prediction" by Kodirjon Akhmedov and Anh Huy Phan, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often discusses previous works and datasets used in the field. 

In the **introduction**, the authors reference Kaggleâ€™s Dota 2 Win Probability Prediction competition, which suggests that there may be datasets associated with this competition. I will note this as a potential dataset.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly the parts discussing data collection and analysis. The authors describe using a data collection tool that integrates with Dota 2's Game State Integration (GSI) to track real-time player data. This indicates that they have created a dataset from their own data collection efforts.

I will also look for any specific mentions of datasets in the **results and experiments sections**. The authors mention testing their models on various datasets, but I need to confirm if they provide specific names or citations for these datasets.

In the **data collection and analysis section**, the authors state that they collected more than 160 features from real-time data during gameplay. However, they do not provide a formal dataset name or citation for this collected data. I will note that this dataset is derived from their own tool and is not publicly available.

Next, I will check the **references section** for any datasets that might have been cited in previous works. The authors reference several papers that may have used datasets relevant to Dota 2, but I will need to verify if these papers provide datasets or if they are merely discussing methodologies.

After reviewing the references, I will compile the following datasets:

1. **Kaggle Dota 2 Win Probability Prediction Dataset**: This dataset is associated with the Kaggle competition mentioned in the introduction. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Kaggle. *Dota 2 Win Probability Prediction*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dota-2-win-probability-prediction

2. **Real-time Dota 2 Data Collection Dataset**: This dataset is generated from the authors' own data collection tool using GSI. Since it is not publicly available, I will note it as:
   > Akhmedov, K., & Phan, A. H. (2023). *Real-time data collection from Dota 2 using Game State Integration*. Unpublished dataset.

Now, I will summarize the findings and prepare to format the dataset entries according to the required structure, ensuring that each dataset is accurately cited and described.
