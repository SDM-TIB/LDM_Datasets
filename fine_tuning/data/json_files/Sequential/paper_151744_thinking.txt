To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Independently Recurrent Neural Network (IndRNN): Building A Longer and Deeper RNN" by Shuai Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that the authors might have used to validate their proposed method. The introduction discusses the challenges of training RNNs and mentions various tasks but does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will carefully read through the subsections of the experiments to identify any datasets mentioned.

Upon reviewing the experiments, I find that the authors conducted evaluations on several tasks, and they mention specific datasets:

1. **Adding Problem**: The authors describe using randomly generated sequences for this task, but they do not provide a specific dataset citation since the data is generated on-the-fly.

2. **Sequential MNIST Classification**: The authors mention using the MNIST dataset for this task. The full citation for the MNIST dataset is:
   > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

3. **Language Modeling**: The authors evaluate their model on the Penn Treebank dataset. The full citation for the Penn Treebank is:
   > Marcus, M. P., Santorini, B., & Marcinkiewicz, M. A. (1993). *Building a Large Annotated Corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2), 313-330.

4. **Skeleton-based Action Recognition**: The authors use the NTU RGB+D dataset for this task. The full citation for the NTU RGB+D dataset is:
   > A. Shahroudy, J. Liu, T.-T. Ng, and G. Wang. *NTU RGB+D: A Large Scale Dataset for 3D Human Activity Analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 1010–1019, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be clearly labeled with its name and citation to ensure proper attribution.
