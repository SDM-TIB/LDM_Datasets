To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatio-Temporal Alignments: Optimal transport through space and time" by Hicham Janati, Marco Cuturi, and Alexandre Gramfort, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions experiments on **handwritten letters and brain imaging data**, which suggests that these datasets are relevant.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their experiments in detail. They mention using:

1. **Brain Imaging Data**: This dataset is derived from real MRI scans and is used to simulate brain signals. The authors state that they generated 200 samples of brain activity data, which are analyzed using their proposed method.

2. **Handwritten Letters Dataset**: This dataset consists of trajectories of pen movements while writing letters. The authors mention that they subsampled the data to keep 10 time points for each sample and used it to evaluate the discriminatory power of their method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **brain imaging data**, the authors reference:
  > Whelan, R., Lonergan, R., Kiiski, H., Nolan, H., Kinsella, K., Bramham, J., O’Brien, M., Reilly, R., Hutchinson, M., and Tubridy, N. (2010). A high-density ERP study reveals latency, amplitude, and topographical differences in multiple sclerosis patients versus controls. *Clinical Neurophysiology*, 121:1420–6.

- For the **handwritten letters dataset**, the citation is:
  > Williams, B., M. Toussaint, and Storkey, A. (2006). Extracting motion primitives from natural handwriting data. In *ICANN*, volume 2, page 634–643.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
