To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detection of Hate Speech using BERT and Hate Speech Word Embedding with Deep Model" by Hind Saleh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors used a "combined balanced dataset from available hate speech datasets," which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods** section, specifically **section 6 (Experiment and Results)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Davidson-ICWSM Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as being used for hate speech detection and is attributed to Davidson et al. (2017).

2. **Waseem-EMNLP Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned as part of the experiments and is attributed to Waseem (2016).

3. **Waseem-NAACL Dataset**: Another dataset used in the study, which is attributed to Waseem and Hovy (2016).

The authors also discuss combining these datasets into a balanced dataset for their analysis, which is important for understanding the context of their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For the **Davidson-ICWSM Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Thomas Davidson, Dana Warmsley, Michael Macy, and Ingmar Weber. *Automated hate speech detection and the problem of offensive language*. In Eleventh International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, 2017.

- For the **Waseem-EMNLP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zeerak Waseem. *Are you a racist or am I seeing things? Annotator influence on hate speech detection on Twitter*. In Proceedings of the First Workshop on NLP and Computational Social Science, pages 138–142, 2016.

- For the **Waseem-NAACL Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zeerak Waseem and Dirk Hovy. *Hateful symbols or hateful people? Predictive features for hate speech detection on Twitter*. In Proceedings of the NAACL Student Research Workshop, pages 88–93, 2016.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is crucial for any further analysis or replication of the study.
