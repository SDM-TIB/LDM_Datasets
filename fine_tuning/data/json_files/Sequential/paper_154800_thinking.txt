To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differentiable Neural Architecture Search with Morphism-based Transformable Backbone Architectures" by Renlong Jie and Junbin Gao, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will check if it mentions any datasets used for experiments. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their content or structure.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or provide additional context. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant characteristics they describe.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. I will do the same for any other datasets mentioned, ensuring that I capture the complete citation details.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, providing clear citations for each one.
