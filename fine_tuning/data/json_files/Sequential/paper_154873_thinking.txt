To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Modal Association based Grouping for Form Structure Extraction" by Milan Aggarwal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a "new rich human-annotated Forms Dataset," which indicates that a dataset is indeed present. I will note this down as a potential dataset to explore further.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide specific details about the dataset they used. Here, they mention their **Forms Dataset**, which comprises 5,000 forms with annotations for various constructs such as text blocks, text fields, choice fields, and choice groups. This section will provide the necessary details about the dataset's composition and its purpose.

In **section 4.1**, the authors also provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of training and testing samples for each construct. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scale and application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. Since the Forms Dataset is introduced by the authors themselves, I will treat it as a primary source. The citation for the dataset will be formatted as follows:

- **Forms Dataset**: 
  > Milan Aggarwal, Mausoom Sarkar, Hiresh Gupta, and Balaji Krishnamurthy. *Multi-Modal Association based Grouping for Form Structure Extraction*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year]. [Additional details if available].

Since the paper does not provide a specific conference name or year in the text provided, I will note that I need to fill in these details based on the actual publication information.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's relevance and context within the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for output, ensuring it is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
