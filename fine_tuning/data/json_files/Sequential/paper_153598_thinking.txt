To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Macromolecule Classification Based on the Amino-acid Sequence" by Faisal Ghaffar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and materials and methods sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on classifying protein sequences, which suggests that datasets related to protein sequences may be involved.

Next, I will examine **section III (Materials and Methods)**, specifically the subsection titled **A. Dataset**. Here, the authors describe the dataset in detail, mentioning that it contains two files with a total of 467,304 entries and 141,401 entries, respectively. This section is crucial as it provides specific information about the datasets used in their experiments.

1. **Dataset 1**: The first dataset consists of sequences of macromolecules, specifically proteins. It has 467,304 entries and five columns. The authors note that this dataset is primarily focused on protein sequences.

2. **Dataset 2**: The second dataset contains protein metadata, including resolution, extraction method, and experimental technique. This dataset has 141,401 entries and 14 columns. The authors mention that they evaluated and preprocessed this dataset for their analysis.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they appear to be original datasets created or compiled by the authors for this study.

Since the datasets are not attributed to external sources, I will note that the datasets are original to this research. I will document the datasets with the following details:

- **Dataset 1**: A dataset of protein sequences with 467,304 entries.
- **Dataset 2**: A dataset of protein metadata with 141,401 entries.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines the datasets, ensuring that I include the full citation of the paper itself as the source of these datasets.

The citation for the paper is:
> Faisal Ghaffar, Sarwar Khan, Gadissa O., Chen Yu-jhen. *Macromolecule Classification Based on the Amino-acid Sequence*. 

Now, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
