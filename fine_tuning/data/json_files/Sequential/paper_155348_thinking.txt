To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding and Improving Sequence-to-Sequence Pretraining for Neural Machine Translation" by Wenxuan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments on various language pairs and mentions the use of benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (section 2.1) where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention three specific datasets:

1. **WMT19 English-German**: This dataset contains 36.8 million instances and is used for machine translation tasks.
2. **WMT16 English-Romanian**: This dataset consists of 610,000 instances and is also used for translation tasks.
3. **IWSLT17 English-French**: This dataset includes 250,000 instances and is used for evaluating translation performance.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics on these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **WMT19 English-German**, the citation is:
  > Barrault, L., et al. (2019). *Findings of the 2019 Conference on Machine Translation (WMT)*. In Proceedings of the Fourth Conference on Machine Translation (WMT), pages 1-14.

- For **WMT16 English-Romanian**, the citation is:
  > Bojar, O., et al. (2016). *Findings of the 2016 Conference on Machine Translation (WMT)*. In Proceedings of the First Conference on Machine Translation (WMT), pages 1-12.

- For **IWSLT17 English-French**, the citation is:
  > Cettolo, M., et al. (2017). *The IWSLT 2017 Evaluation Campaign*. In Proceedings of the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT), pages 1-12.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a clear and comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research.
