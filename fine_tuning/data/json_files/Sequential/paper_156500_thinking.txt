To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Novel Decision Ensemble Framework: Customized Attention-BiLSTM and XGBoost for Speculative Stock Price Forecasting" by Riaz Ud Din et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper evaluates the proposed CAB-XDE framework using a dataset sourced from Yahoo Finance for Bitcoin price prediction. This suggests that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if there are any additional details about the datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of predicting Bitcoin prices but does not provide specific dataset names or details.

I will then examine **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Dataset 1**: This dataset covers the period from **10/01/2014 to 11/07/2022** and includes features such as Daily Opening Price, Daily Maximum Price, Daily Minimum Price, Daily Trading Volume, and Daily Closing Price. The target variable is set as the Daily Close Price.

2. **Dataset 2**: This dataset spans from **08/11/2022 to 01/08/2023** and also includes the same features as Dataset 1, with the target variable being the Daily Close Price.

Both datasets are sourced from Yahoo Finance, which is crucial for providing context about the data's origin.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. However, since the datasets are sourced from Yahoo Finance and not from a specific academic paper, I will note that the citation for the dataset is as follows:

- **Yahoo Finance Bitcoin Dataset**: 
  > Yahoo Finance. *Bitcoin Historical Data*. Available: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/history?p=BTC-USD. Accessed: [Date of Access].

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
