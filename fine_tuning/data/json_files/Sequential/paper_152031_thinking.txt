To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Image-based localization using LSTMs for structured feature correlation" by F. Walch et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present a new large-scale indoor dataset with accurate ground truth from a laser scanner, which suggests that a dataset is indeed introduced.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention their contributions, including the introduction of the TUM-LSI dataset. They describe it as a large-scale indoor dataset consisting of 1,095 high-resolution images with geo-referenced pose information. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

In the **section 3 (A large-scale indoor localization dataset)**, the authors provide detailed information about the TUM-LSI dataset, including its size (5,575 mÂ²), the number of images, and the method used to capture the ground truth pose information. This section confirms the dataset's significance and provides necessary details for citation.

Additionally, I will check the **experiments section** to see if any other datasets are mentioned. The authors reference the Cambridge Landmarks dataset and the 7Scenes dataset as part of their experimental setup. They provide results on these datasets, which indicates that they are also relevant to the research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **TUM-LSI Dataset**: The citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but the dataset is introduced in the paper itself. I will note that it is available at the provided URL: https://tum-lsi.vision.cs.tum.edu.

2. **Cambridge Landmarks Dataset**: The citation is:
   > A. Kendall, M. Grimes, and R. Cipolla. *PoseNet: A convolutional network for real-time 6-dof camera relocalization*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015.

3. **7Scenes Dataset**: The citation is:
   > J. Shotton, B. Glocker, C. Zach, S. Izadi, A. Criminisi, and A. Fitzgibbon. *Scene coordinate regression forests for camera relocalization in RGB-D images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2013.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will allow for accurate documentation and referencing in any subsequent analysis or application of the research findings.
