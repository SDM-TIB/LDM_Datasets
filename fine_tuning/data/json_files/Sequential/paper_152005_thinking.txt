To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Voice 2: Multi-Speaker Neural Text-to-Speech" by Sercan Ö. Arık et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their technique on "two multi-speaker TTS datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 5.2 (Multi-Speaker Speech Synthesis)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for training their models. They state that they trained on the **VCTK dataset** and an **internal dataset of audiobooks**. 

1. **VCTK Dataset**: The authors describe it as containing 44 hours of speech from 108 speakers, with approximately 400 utterances each. This dataset is crucial for their multi-speaker TTS models.

2. **Internal Audiobook Dataset**: This dataset consists of 477 speakers with about 30 minutes of audio each, totaling approximately 238 hours. This dataset is also significant for their experiments.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The VCTK dataset is commonly cited in the literature, and I will provide its citation as follows:

- For the **VCTK dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. Wang, R. Skerry-Ryan, D. Stanton, Y. Wu, R. J. Weiss, N. Jaitly, Z. Yang, Y. Xiao, Z. Chen, S. Bengio, et al. *Tacotron: Towards end-to-end speech synthesis*. In Interspeech, 2017.

The internal audiobook dataset does not have a specific citation provided in the references, as it is an internal dataset created by the authors. Therefore, I will note it as an internal dataset without a formal citation.

Now, I will summarize the datasets extracted:

1. **VCTK Dataset**: A multi-speaker dataset with 44 hours of speech from 108 speakers.
   - Citation: Y. Wang et al. *Tacotron: Towards end-to-end speech synthesis*. In Interspeech, 2017.

2. **Internal Audiobook Dataset**: Contains 477 speakers with approximately 238 hours of audio.
   - Citation: Not available (internal dataset).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
