To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contextualize, Show and Tell: A Neural Visual Storyteller" by Diana Gonzalez-Rico and Gibran Fuentes-Pineda, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in the **Visual Storytelling Challenge 2018**, which suggests that there may be a specific dataset associated with this challenge.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference the **VIST dataset** (Huang et al., 2016) as the dataset used for generating stories from image sequences. This is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their work.

Next, I will look for any additional details about the datasets in the **evaluation section**. Here, the authors mention that they evaluated their generated stories using a public test set from the **VIST dataset**, which consists of 1,938 image sequences and stories. This confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **VIST dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Ting-Hao K. Huang, Francis Ferraro, Nasrin Mostafazadeh, Ishan Misra, Jacob Devlin, Aishwarya Agrawal, Ross Girshick, Xiaodong He, Pushmeet Kohli, and Dhruv Batra et al. *Visual storytelling*. In 15th Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL 2016).

Since the authors also mention using the **NYC and Disney datasets** in the context of previous work, I will look for their citations as well. However, the paper does not provide detailed information about these datasets, so I will note that they were referenced but not elaborated upon.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The primary dataset extracted is the **VIST dataset**, and I will include the NYC and Disney datasets as references, even though their citations are not provided in detail.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its citation for future reference.
