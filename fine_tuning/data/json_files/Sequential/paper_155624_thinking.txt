To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Text Difficulty Study: Do machines behave the same as humans regarding text difficulty?" by Bowen Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the investigation of how text difficulty affects models, but they do not mention specific datasets yet. I will need to look further into the **experiments section** for detailed information.

In **section 4.1 (Datasets and Models)**, the authors list several datasets used in their experiments:

1. **SST2**: A sentiment analysis dataset for binary classification.
2. **MRPC**: A dataset for paraphrase identification, which involves single and pair-wise sentence binary classification.
3. **QNLI**: A dataset for question answering, derived from the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD).
4. **RTE**: A dataset for recognizing textual entailment, which involves multiple classification tasks.
5. **STS-B**: A dataset for semantic textual similarity, evaluated using Pearson correlation.
6. **ROC Story**: A dataset for multiple-choice questions based on story completion.
7. **WIKITEXT2**: A dataset for language modeling.
8. **SQUAD 2.0**: A dataset for question answering that includes unanswerable questions.
9. **CoNLL2003 NER**: A dataset for named entity recognition.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. Here are the citations I will extract:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as presented in the paper.
