To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stabilizing DARTS with Amended Gradient Estimation on Architectural Parameters" by Kaifeng Bi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any explicit mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions experiments on **CIFAR10** and **ImageNet**, indicating that these are likely the datasets used in the study.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (Section 4) for detailed descriptions of the datasets. In **Section 4.1**, the authors describe the **CIFAR10 dataset**, stating it has 50,000 training and 10,000 testing images, distributed across 10 classes. They also mention using **ImageNet** (specifically the ILSVRC2012 subset), which contains 1.3 million training images and 50,000 testing images across 1,000 categories.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper. In **Section 4.3**, the authors refer to the **Penn Treebank dataset**, which is used for language modeling tasks.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **CIFAR10**:
   - Citation:
     > Krizhevsky, A. and Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Technical report.

2. **ImageNet (ILSVRC2012)**:
   - Citation:
     > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., et al. (2015). ImageNet large scale visual recognition challenge. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252.

3. **Penn Treebank**:
   - Citation:
     > Zoph, B. and Le, Q. V. (2017). Neural architecture search with reinforcement learning. In International Conference on Learning Representations.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
