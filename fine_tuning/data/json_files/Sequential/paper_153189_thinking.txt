To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scene-based Factored Attention for Image Captioning" by Chen Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on the **Microsoft COCO benchmark**, which indicates that this dataset is likely to be one of the primary datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1 (Experimental Settings), the authors explicitly state that they utilize the **MS COCO dataset** for their experiments. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of images and the number of captions per image, which confirms its significance in their work.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MS COCO dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **MS COCO dataset**:
  > Xinlei Chen, Hao Fang, Tsung-Yi Lin, Ramakrishna Vedantam, Saurabh Gupta, Piotr Doll√°r, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO Captions: Data Collection and Evaluation Server*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.00325, 2015.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the MS COCO dataset for its experiments, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
