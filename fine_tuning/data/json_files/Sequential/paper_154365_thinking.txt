To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "ONION: A Simple and Effective Defense Against Textual Backdoor Attacks" by Fanchao Qi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the study.

In the **experiments section**, I will specifically look for any subsections that detail the datasets used. The authors mention using three real-world datasets for different tasks in **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**. Here, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **SST-2**: A binary sentiment analysis dataset composed of 9,612 sentences from movie reviews.
2. **OffensEval**: A binary offensive language identification dataset comprising 14,102 sentences from Twitter.
3. **AG News**: A four-class news topic classification dataset containing 30,399 sentences from news articles.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **SST-2**, the citation is:
  > Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J., Chuang, J., Manning, C. D., Ng, A., & Potts, C. (2013). Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank. In Proceedings of EMNLP.

- For **OffensEval**, the citation is:
  > Zampieri, M., Malmasi, S., Nakov, P., Rosenthal, S., Farra, N., & Kumar, R. (2019). Predicting the type and target of offensive posts in social media. In Proceedings of NAACL-HLT.

- For **AG News**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, X., Zhao, J., & LeCun, Y. (2015). Character-level convolutional networks for text classification. In Proceedings of NeurIPS.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
