To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Product Recommender for Online Advertising" by Milad Vaali Esfahaani, Yanbo Xue, and Peyman Setoodeh, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **RecoGym environment** for training the recommender systems, which suggests that this environment is a dataset or a simulation framework relevant to the study.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe using the **RecoGym environment** for their experiments. I will need to confirm if this environment is associated with any specific datasets or if it is a standalone simulation tool.

I will also check the **references section** to see if there are any citations related to the RecoGym environment or any other datasets that might have been used in the experiments. The references may provide additional context or full citations for datasets that are indirectly mentioned.

Upon reviewing the references, I find the following citation for the RecoGym environment:
- **RecoGym**: 
  > D. Rohde, S. Bonner, T. Dunlop, F. Vasile, and A. Karatzoglou, “RecoGym: A reinforcement learning learning environment for the problem of product recommendation in online advertising,” arXiv preprint arXiv:1808.00720, 2018.

Since the paper primarily discusses the RecoGym environment and does not mention any other specific datasets, I will focus on this environment as the primary dataset used in the research.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the RecoGym environment as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **RecoGym Environment**: A simulation environment used for training RL-based recommender systems in online advertising.

I will now prepare the dataset entry for the RecoGym environment, ensuring to include the full citation as noted above.
