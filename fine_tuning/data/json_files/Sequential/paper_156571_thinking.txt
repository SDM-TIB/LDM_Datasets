To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient CNN-LSTM based Parameter Estimation of Lévy Driven Stochastic Differential Equations" by Shuaiyu Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses experiments on synthetic datasets, which suggests that there may be specific datasets used for validation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in Section III, where they detail the generation of synthetic datasets for their experiments. They mention generating samples using the Euler-Maruyama method and specify the parameters used for generating these datasets.

I will note the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Synthetic Datasets for Gaussian-driven SDEs**: The authors generated 200,000 samples for training and 5,000 samples for testing, with parameters spanning specific ranges. The dataset is created to evaluate the performance of the proposed method on Gaussian-driven Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes.

2. **Synthetic Datasets for α-stable driven SDEs**: Similar to the Gaussian case, the authors generated 200,000 training samples and 5,000 testing samples, with parameters specified in a table. This dataset is used to assess the performance of the method on α-stable driven SDEs.

3. **Synthetic Datasets for Student Lévy driven SDEs**: Again, the authors generated 200,000 training samples and 5,000 testing samples, with parameters defined in a table. This dataset is used to evaluate the method's performance on Student Lévy driven SDEs.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or methods referenced. However, since these datasets are synthetic and generated by the authors, they may not have formal citations. Instead, I will document the methodology used to generate these datasets as follows:

- For the **Gaussian-driven SDEs**, the dataset is generated using the Euler-Maruyama method with parameters specified in Table II of the paper.

- For the **α-stable driven SDEs**, the dataset is generated similarly, with parameters outlined in Table IV.

- For the **Student Lévy driven SDEs**, the dataset is generated using a modified rejection method, with parameters specified in Table VI.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the relevant details about each dataset, including the generation method and the parameters used, while also noting that these datasets are synthetic and generated for the purpose of the experiments in this study.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
