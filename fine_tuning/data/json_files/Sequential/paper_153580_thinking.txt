To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Utterance-level Permutation Invariant Training with Latency-controlled BLSTM for Single-channel Multi-talker Speech Separation" by Lu Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not detail specific datasets. The introduction may reference prior works that utilized certain datasets, which could be useful.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section IV), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, the authors mention that the dataset is generated by mixing utterances from the WSJ0 corpus at various signal-to-noise ratios. This indicates that the WSJ0 corpus is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference several works that may provide additional context or datasets used in their research. 

The specific dataset mentioned is:

1. **WSJ0 Corpus**: The paper states that the dataset is generated by mixing utterances from the WSJ0 corpus, which is a well-known dataset for speech recognition tasks. The authors describe the dataset's characteristics, including the number of mixtures for training, validation, and testing.

Now, I will look for the full citation for the WSJ0 corpus in the references section. The citation is typically found in the context of the original work that introduced or utilized the dataset.

The citation for the WSJ0 corpus is:
> P. Godfrey, D. Holliman, and J. McDaniel. *SWB: The Switchboard Corpus of Conversational Speech*. Linguistic Data Consortium, 1992.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
