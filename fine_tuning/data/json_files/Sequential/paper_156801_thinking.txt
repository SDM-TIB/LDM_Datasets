To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating In-store Customer Journeys from Scratch with GPT Architectures" by Taizo Horikomi and Takayuki Mizuno, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilized customer trajectory data, layout diagrams, and retail scanner data, which suggests that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Data)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their study. Here, they mention that the data was provided by **TSURUHA HOLDINGS, INC.**, a major retail chain in Japan, and consists of:

1. **Customer Trajectory Data**: This data was captured using the Quuppa system, which tracks indoor trajectories with high precision. The authors specify that this data includes one yearâ€™s worth of customer trajectories from two stores in the Tokyo metropolitan area.

2. **Layout Diagrams**: These diagrams represent the floor plans of the stores, detailing the product categories and their respective zones. Store A has 61 zones, while Store B has 41 zones.

3. **Retail Scanner Data**: This dataset includes sales data recorded at checkout, detailing items sold, sales dates, product codes, names, prices, quantities, and categories.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets. However, since the datasets are proprietary and provided by TSURUHA HOLDINGS, INC., they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note the source as the company itself.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the datasets as required. The citations will be as follows:

- For **Customer Trajectory Data**:
  > TSURUHA HOLDINGS, INC. *Customer trajectory data from two retail stores in the Tokyo metropolitan area, 2021*.

- For **Layout Diagrams**:
  > TSURUHA HOLDINGS, INC. *Layout diagrams for Store A and Store B, 2021*.

- For **Retail Scanner Data**:
  > TSURUHA HOLDINGS, INC. *Retail scanner data from two retail stores, including sales records, 2021*.

Finally, I will ensure that all dataset entries are clearly documented and ready for further processing or review.
