To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Empirical Review of Deep Learning Frameworks for Change Detection: Model Design, Experimental Frameworks, Challenges and Research Needs" by Murari Mandal and Santosh Kumar Vipparthi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss datasets** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on change detection, but I need to look for specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **section on datasets** (which is likely to be in the latter part of the paper) to find explicit mentions of datasets used in the experiments or evaluations. In this case, the paper discusses several datasets relevant to change detection, including:

1. **CDnet 2014**: This dataset is highlighted as a benchmark for change detection, containing a diverse set of scenarios with a total of 159,279 frames and 90,000 labeled instances.

2. **LASIESTA**: This dataset includes 18,425 frames and is noted for providing object category labels along with foreground pixel labels.

3. **PTIS/I2R**: This dataset consists of 18,449 frames and is used for evaluating change detection methods.

4. **SBI2015**: This dataset has 5,029 frames and is mentioned as another resource for change detection evaluation.

5. **UCSD**: This dataset contains 885 frames and is also referenced in the context of change detection.

6. **Fish4Knowledge**: This underwater dataset includes 17 videos with a total of 47,200 frames.

7. **UnderwaterCD**: This dataset has 5 videos, each with 100 frames.

8. **GTFD**: This thermal dataset includes 1,067 frames and is used for thermal video-based change detection.

9. **MOR-UAV**: A new dataset introduced for aerial video analysis, consisting of videos captured from UAVs.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
