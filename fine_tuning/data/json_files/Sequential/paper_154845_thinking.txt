To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PASTPROP-RNN: Improved Predictions of the Future by Correcting the Past" by André Baptista et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their method on forecasting competition datasets, specifically mentioning **M4**, **M5**, and the **Numenta Anomaly Benchmark**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experimental setup** section, particularly **section 4 (Experimental setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they explicitly mention that the research was performed on 855 time series taken from the **M4** and **M5 forecasting competition datasets** and the **Numenta Anomaly Benchmark**. This confirms that these datasets are indeed utilized in their experiments.

In **section 4.5 (Datasets)**, the authors provide descriptive analytics for the M4 and M5 datasets, which include average lengths, means, and standard deviations. They also mention that the M5 dataset was used with artificially inserted anomalies, which is relevant for understanding the context of the data.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **M4 Forecasting Competition Dataset**: The citation is:
   > M4 Forecasting Competition. *M4 Forecasting Competition Dataset*. Available at: https://www.mcompetitions.unimaas.nl/the-datasets/m4-competition/

2. **M5 Forecasting Competition Dataset**: The citation is:
   > M5 Forecasting Competition. *M5 Forecasting Competition Dataset*. Available at: https://www.mcompetitions.unimaas.nl/the-datasets/m5-competition/

3. **Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB)**: The citation is:
   > Alexander Lavin and Subutai Ahmad. Evaluating real-time anomaly detection algorithms–the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark. In 2015 IEEE 14th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA), pages 38–44. IEEE, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its corresponding citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
