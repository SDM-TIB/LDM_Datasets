To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RipViz: Finding Rip Currents by Learning Pathline Behavior" by Akila de Silva et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors collected data from stationary videos to develop their method, which indicates that there is a dataset involved. The introduction further elaborates on the challenges of detecting rip currents and hints at the use of specific datasets for training and validation.

Next, I will focus on the **dataset section**, which is typically where authors describe the datasets they used. In this paper, I find that **section 4.1 (Dataset)** provides detailed information about the dataset. The authors state that their dataset consists of **55 stationary videos** collected from various beaches in California, with specific details about the video lengths and equipment used.

The dataset description includes:
- **Number of videos**: 55
- **Video duration**: Each video is between 1.5 to 4 minutes long.
- **Resolution**: The videos are of size 1920 × 1080 pixels.
- **Collection locations**: Salinas, Marina, and Davenport beaches in California.
- **Equipment used**: Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR camera and a Samsung Android phone.

The authors also mention that they generated **16,000 non-rip pathline sequences** for training and **12,000 pathlines** for validation, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the datasets mentioned. However, since the dataset is primarily composed of videos collected by the authors, there may not be a formal citation for it like there would be for publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper itself.

The relevant citation for the paper is:
> Akila de Silva, Mona Zhao, Donald Stewart, Fahim Hasan Khan, Gregory Dusek, James Davis, and Alex Pang. *RipViz: Finding Rip Currents by Learning Pathline Behavior*. In IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 2023. doi: 10.1109/TVCG.2023.3243834.

Since the dataset is original and not publicly available, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: RipViz Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset consisting of 55 stationary videos collected from Salinas, Marina, and Davenport beaches in California, used for training and validating a rip current detection method.
   - **Number of Videos**: 55
   - **Video Duration**: 1.5 to 4 minutes
   - **Resolution**: 1920 × 1080 pixels
   - **Equipment**: Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR camera and Samsung Android phone
   - **Training Pathline Sequences**: 16,000 non-rip pathline sequences
   - **Validation Pathline Sequences**: 12,000 pathlines

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I have captured all necessary details about the dataset and its citation.
