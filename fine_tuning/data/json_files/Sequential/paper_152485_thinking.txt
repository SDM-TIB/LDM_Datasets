To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fundamentals of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network" by Alex Sherstinsky, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies**. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, but it may not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will pay particular attention to the **introduction** and any **methodology or experiments sections** where datasets are likely to be discussed.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, or specific applications. If the paper references any datasets used for training or evaluation, I will note these down carefully.

In this paper, there are no specific datasets mentioned in the abstract or introduction. However, I will continue to scan through the **main body of the text**, particularly focusing on sections that might describe experiments or applications of the RNN and LSTM models. If the author discusses any datasets used for training or testing the models, I will extract that information.

If I find any datasets, I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

Once I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant statistics.
3. The full citation for the dataset as it appears in the references.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and clearly presented, ready for further processing or review. If no datasets are found, I will note that as well.
