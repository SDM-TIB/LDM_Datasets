To extract datasets from the research paper titled "InstaNAS: Instance-aware Neural Architecture Search" by An-Chieh Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves significant latency reduction on a series of datasets, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing Section 4.1 (Experiment Setups), I find that the authors validate InstaNAS on several datasets, specifically:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
3. **TinyImageNet**: A smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 100,000 images across 200 classes.
4. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with over 14 million images across thousands of categories, commonly used for image classification tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, 2009.

- For **TinyImageNet**, the citation is:
  > A. Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, 2009. (Note: TinyImageNet is often derived from the ImageNet dataset, but specific references may vary.)

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
