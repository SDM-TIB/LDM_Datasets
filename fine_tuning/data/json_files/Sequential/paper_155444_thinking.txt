To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "HARMOF0: Logarithmic Scale Dilated Convolution for Pitch Estimation" by Weixing Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed model evaluates its performance on three datasets, which suggests that I should find their names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide specific information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they list three datasets:

1. **MIR-1K**: This dataset contains 1000 song clips with music accompaniment and singing voice recorded in separate channels, along with manual pitch annotations. The total length of the dataset is 133 minutes.

2. **MDB-stem-synth**: This dataset consists of 230 solo stems (tracks) from various musical instruments and voices, derived from the MedleyDB dataset, with perfect f0 annotations obtained through analysis/synthesis methods.

3. **PTDB-TUG**: This is a speech database for pitch tracking, containing recordings from 20 English native speakers, with extracted pitch trajectories as references. It includes 4720 recorded sentences.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MIR-1K**, the citation is:
  > J. Salamon and E. Gómez, “An analysis/synthesis framework for automatic f0 annotation of multitrack datasets,” in Proc. Int. Soc. Music Inf. Retrieval, pp. 71–78, 2017.

- For **MDB-stem-synth**, the citation is:
  > R. M. Bittner et al., “MedleyDB: A multitrack dataset for annotation-intensive MIR research,” in Proc. Int. Soc. Music Inf. Retrieval, pp. 155–160, 2014.

- For **PTDB-TUG**, the citation is:
  > G. Pirker et al., “A pitch tracking corpus with evaluation on multipitch tracking scenario,” in Conference of the International Speech Communication Association, pp. 1509–1512, 2011.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
