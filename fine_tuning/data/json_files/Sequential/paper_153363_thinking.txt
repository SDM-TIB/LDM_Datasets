To extract datasets from the research paper titled "False Data Injection Attacks in Internet of Things and Deep Learning enabled Predictive Analytics" by Gautam Raj Mode et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors use **NASA’s C-MAPSS dataset** for their experiments, which is a strong lead.

Next, I will focus on **section III (DL Algorithms for RUL Prediction)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the C-MAPSS dataset includes 21 sensor data with various operating conditions and fault conditions, and it consists of four sub-datasets (FD001-04). This section provides crucial information about the dataset's structure and purpose.

In **section IV (Modeling of FDIA)**, the authors reiterate their use of the C-MAPSS dataset for modeling false data injection attacks. This confirms that the dataset is central to their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the C-MAPSS dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> A. Saxena and K. Goebel, “C-mapss data set,” NASA Ames Prognostics Data Repository, 2008.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format.

I will ensure that the dataset entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as specified. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
