To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Aspect Detection Using Word and Char Embeddings with (Bi)LSTM and CRF" by Łukasz Augustyniak et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on various models of aspect extraction, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe their experiments. In **subsection 4.4 (SemEval datasets)**, they explicitly mention using the **SemEval 2014 datasets** for Laptops and Restaurants. This is a crucial finding, as it directly points to the datasets used in their experiments.

I will then gather specific details about these datasets from the text. The authors provide a profile of the SemEval 2014 datasets, including the number of sentences and aspects for both the Laptops and Restaurants datasets. This information is essential for a comprehensive description of each dataset.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The SemEval 2014 datasets are referenced in the paper, and I will ensure to include the citation for the original SemEval task report.

The citations I need to include are:

- For the **SemEval 2014 Task 4 datasets**:
  > Maria Pontiki, Haris Papageorgiou, Dimitrios Galanis, Ion Androutsopoulos, John Pavlopoulos, and Suresh Manandhar. *SemEval-2014 Task 4: Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis*. Technical report, 2014.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
