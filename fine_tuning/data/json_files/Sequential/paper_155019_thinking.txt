To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revisiting Tri-training of Dependency Parsers" by Joachim Wagner and Jennifer Foster, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the focus on low-resource languages and the selection of specific languages for the experiments, which suggests that datasets related to these languages may be included.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experimental setup** section. In this paper, the authors specifically mention using treebanks for their experiments. I will identify the names of these treebanks and any relevant details provided.

In the **experimental setup (Section 3.3)**, the authors list the selected treebanks:
1. **Hungarian (hu_szeged)**: This treebank is mentioned as part of the Universal Dependencies (UD) project.
2. **Uyghur (ug_udt)**: Another treebank included in the experiments, also part of the UD project.
3. **Vietnamese (vi_vtb)**: This treebank is similarly part of the UD project.
4. **English (en_ewt)**: The authors simulate a low-resource scenario using a subset of this treebank.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the treebanks are typically included in the references of papers related to the Universal Dependencies project.

The citations I will extract are:
- For **Hungarian (hu_szeged)**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in maintaining clarity and ensuring that all relevant datasets are captured effectively.
