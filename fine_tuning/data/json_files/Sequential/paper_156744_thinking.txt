To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-variable Linear Integrated ENhanced Transformer for Photovoltaic power forecasting" by Jiaxin Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "three real-world PV power datasets," which indicates that there are specific datasets used in their research. I will note this as a key point to investigate further.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors describe their methodology and data sources. In subsection 3.1, titled "Data description and experiment setting," the authors explicitly mention the three photovoltaic power stations from which they collected data:

1. **Jingang Photovoltaic Power Station** in Shenzhen, China.
2. **Xinqingnian Photovoltaic Power Station** in Ningbo, China.
3. **Hongxing Photovoltaic Power Station** in Sanya, China.

The authors provide details about the data collected from these stations, including the time frame and the types of weather data used alongside the PV power data. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. While the paper does not provide formal citations for the datasets themselves, I can infer that the datasets are likely associated with the respective photovoltaic power stations. Therefore, I will create citations based on the information provided in the paper:

- For the **Jingang Photovoltaic Power Station**, the citation could be:
  > Jingang Photovoltaic Power Station, Shenzhen, China. Data collected from 2022.8.15 to 2023.7.28.

- For the **Xinqingnian Photovoltaic Power Station**, the citation could be:
  > Xinqingnian Photovoltaic Power Station, Ningbo, China. Data collected from 2022.8.15 to 2023.10.8.

- For the **Hongxing Photovoltaic Power Station**, the citation could be:
  > Hongxing Photovoltaic Power Station, Sanya, China. Data collected from 2023.3.1 to 2023.10.8.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help in accurately representing the datasets used in the research paper.
