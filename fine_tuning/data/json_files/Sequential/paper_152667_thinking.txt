To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Effect of Explicit Structure Encoding of Deep Neural Networks for Symbolic Music Generation" by Ke Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on symbolic music generation, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide more context or references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Experiments)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the study. In this section, the authors mention using the **Nottingham Database**, which consists of 941 folk songs, and they specify that 631 songs were used for training. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **methodology** or **results** sections, but it seems that the Nottingham Database is the primary dataset referenced for the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Nottingham Database. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Nottingham Music Database, http://abc.sourceforge.net/NMD/, 2013.

Since this is a web resource, I will ensure to format it correctly in the citation style used in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details as follows:

1. **Nottingham Database**: A collection of 941 folk songs, with 631 songs used for training in the study. The dataset includes both melody and chords, and the authors performed data augmentation by switching all available songs to 12 major or minor tonalities.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that the full citation is included, and prepare it for structured output as required. This thorough approach ensures that I capture all relevant details about the dataset used in the research paper.
