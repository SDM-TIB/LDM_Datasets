To extract datasets from the research paper titled "cGAN-Based High Dimensional IMU Sensor Data Generation for Therapeutic Activities" by Mohammad Mohammadzadeh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the generation of realistic IMU signals for activity recognition, which suggests that there may be a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Material and Methods)**, particularly the **Dataset** subsection. Here, the authors describe the dataset collected at the Djavad Mowafaghian Research Centre. They mention that the dataset contains sensor information from 34 therapeutic activities, collected from 43 healthy individuals. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including the number of activities and subjects involved.

The authors also specify that the dataset includes data from four inertia sensors mounted on the wrists and thighs, capturing angular velocities and linear accelerations. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the dataset is described as being collected by the authors themselves, and there may not be an external citation. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is proprietary to the research conducted by the authors.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **Therapeutic Activities Dataset**: This dataset includes sensor data from 34 therapeutic activities, collected from 43 healthy individuals using four IMU sensors. The dataset is significant for its division of complex activities into simpler ones, aiding in both data generation and classification.

Since there is no external citation for this dataset, I will document it as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Therapeutic Activities Dataset
- **Description**: Contains sensor information of 34 therapeutic activities collected from 43 healthy individuals using four IMU sensors (angular velocities and linear accelerations).
- **Citation**: Not applicable (dataset collected by the authors).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
