To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SGHormer: An Energy-Saving Graph Transformer Driven by Spikes" by Huizhe Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that SGHormer achieves comparable performances on various graph-related tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using five datasets from Benchmarking-GNNs and two datasets from the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB). I will look for specific mentions of these datasets and their characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors list the datasets as follows:

1. **ZINC**: A dataset used for molecular property prediction.
2. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition.
3. **CIFAR10**: A dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
4. **PATTERN**: A dataset used for graph classification tasks.
5. **CLUSTER**: Another dataset for graph classification tasks.
6. **ogbg-molhiv**: A dataset for molecular property prediction, specifically for HIV activity.
7. **ogbg-molpcba**: A dataset for molecular property prediction, focusing on multi-task learning.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **ZINC**, the citation is:
  > Dwivedi, V. P., et al. "Benchmarking graph neural networks." *Journal of Machine Learning Research*, 24(43):1-48, 2023.

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y., et al. "Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition." *Proceedings of the IEEE*, 86(11):2278-2324, 1998.

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. "Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images." Technical Report, 2009.

- For **PATTERN**, the citation is:
  > Dwivedi, V. P., et al. "Benchmarking graph neural networks." *Journal of Machine Learning Research*, 24(43):1-48, 2023.

- For **CLUSTER**, the citation is:
  > Dwivedi, V. P., et al. "Benchmarking graph neural networks." *Journal of Machine Learning Research*, 24(43):1-48, 2023.

- For **ogbg-molhiv**, the citation is:
  > Hu, W., et al. "Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs." *Proceedings of the 43rd International Conference on Machine Learning*, 2021.

- For **ogbg-molpcba**, the citation is:
  > Hu, W., et al. "Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs." *Proceedings of the 43rd International Conference on Machine Learning*, 2021.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
