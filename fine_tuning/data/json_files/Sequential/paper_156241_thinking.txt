To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-model fusion for Aerial Vision and Dialog Navigation based on human attention aids" by Xinyi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **AVDN dataset**, which is a strong indication that there is at least one dataset to extract.

In the **introduction**, the authors provide context about the AVDN dataset, stating it contains **3064 aerial navigation tracks**. This section also highlights the dataset's purpose and its relevance to the research, which is crucial for understanding its application.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 3.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the AVDN dataset again. They describe its structure, including the number of tracks and the types of instructions contained within. This reinforces the importance of the AVDN dataset in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the AVDN dataset. The citation provided is:

- For the **AVDN dataset**:
  > Fan, Y., Chen, W., Jiang, T., Zhou, C., Zhang, Y., and Wang, X. E. (2022). *Aerial Vision-and-Dialog Navigation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2205.12219. doi:10.48550/arXiv.2205.12219.

Since the paper primarily discusses the AVDN dataset, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the AVDN dataset, ensuring it is ready for any further processing or review.
