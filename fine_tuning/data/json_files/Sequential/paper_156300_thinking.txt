To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine Learning Technique Based Fake News Detection" by Biplob Kumar Sutradhar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors utilized a dataset consisting of 1876 news articles, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will examine the **Dataset and Data Preprocessing** section, as it is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the research. Here, the authors describe their dataset as a combination of "english_dev.csv" (364 rows) and "english_training.csv" (900 rows), totaling 1264 rows for the training set, along with a test set comprising 612 rows. This section also specifies the attributes of the dataset, which include “public_id”, “title”, “text”, and “our rating”.

The authors also mention that the dataset contains four classes for the “our rating” column: False, True, Partially false, and Other. This classification is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will look for any references to the dataset's source or citation in the **References** section. The authors reference a dataset from Asr & Taboada (2019) titled "Misinfotext: a collection of news articles, with false and true labels." This citation is relevant as it provides context for the dataset used in their research.

I will compile the information about the datasets as follows:

1. **Custom Dataset**: The authors created a dataset from their own collection, which includes the training and test sets described above. However, since this dataset is not publicly available, I will note it as a custom dataset without a formal citation.

2. **Misinfotext Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the paper and is relevant to the topic of fake news detection. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Asr, F. T., & Taboada, M. (2019). Misinfotext: a collection of news articles, with false and true labels.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their citations for any future use or reference. This structured approach will help in organizing the datasets effectively for further analysis or processing.
