To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-objective Neural Architecture Search via Non-stationary Policy Gradient" by Zewei Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted an extensive experimental study with various datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 6) where the authors describe their experimental setup. In this section, they explicitly mention using **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets for their architecture search. They provide details about how the original training set is divided into a training set (Dtrain) and a validation set (Dvalid) for the experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.

Since both datasets are from the same source, I will ensure to document them correctly.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured representation of the datasets used in the research paper.
