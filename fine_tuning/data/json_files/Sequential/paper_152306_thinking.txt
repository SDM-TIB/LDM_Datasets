To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Chinese Song Iambics Generation with Neural Attention-based Model" by Qixin Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the generation of Chinese poems, which suggests that there may be datasets related to poetry or language modeling.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Design)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two key datasets:

1. **Song iambics corpus (Songci)**: This dataset consists of 15,689 Song iambics collected from the Internet, with 15,001 used for training and 688 for testing. This dataset is crucial for their model training and evaluation.

2. **Gigaword corpus**: This dataset contains roughly 1.12 billion Chinese characters and is used to train the word embedding model. It is significant for understanding the language context in which the model operates.

In addition to these, the authors mention using other regulated verses and quatrains to enhance their statistical machine translation (SMT) model, but the primary datasets for their experiments are the Songci and Gigaword corpora.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Songci corpus**, since it is a collection of Song iambics from various sources, it may not have a single citation. However, I can note that it is a compilation of historical texts and can be referenced as:
  > Wang, Q., Luo, T., Wang, D., & Xing, C. (2023). *Chinese Song Iambics Generation with Neural Attention-based Model*. Tsinghua University.

- For the **Gigaword corpus**, the citation is:
  > Graff, P., & Cieri, C. (2003). *The Linguistic Data Consortium Gigaword Corpus*. Linguistic Data Consortium.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the requirements.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary details are included for further processing or review.
