To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Time Matters: Time-Aware LSTMs for Predictive Business Process Monitoring" by An Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on publicly available benchmark event logs, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe two datasets:

1. **Helpdesk Dataset**: This dataset originates from a ticket management process of an Italian software company. It contains 3,804 instances, 154 case variants, and 9 unique activities, with a total of 13,710 events.

2. **BPI’12 W Subprocess Dataset**: This dataset is provided by the Business Process Intelligence (BPI) 2012 challenge and comes from a German financial institution's loan application process. It consists of 9,658 instances, 2,263 case variants, and 6 unique activities, totaling 72,413 events.

In the same section, the authors provide links to the datasets, which are crucial for citation purposes. I will note these links for the full citations.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Helpdesk Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Helpdesk Dataset. *Event Log from a ticket management process of an Italian software company*. Available at: https://doi.org/10.4121/uuid:0c60edf1-6f83-4e75-9367-4c63b3e9d5bb.

- For the **BPI’12 W Subprocess Dataset**, the citation is:
  > BPI’12 W Subprocess Dataset. *Event Log from the Business Process Intelligence (BPI) 2012 challenge*. Available at: https://doi.org/10.4121/uuid:3926db30-f712-4394-aebc-75976070e91f.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or reference.
