To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CloudCast: A Satellite-Based Dataset and Baseline for Forecasting Clouds" by Andreas Holm Nielsen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a novel dataset called "CloudCast," which consists of 70,080 images with various cloud types annotated on a pixel level. This indicates that the dataset is central to the paper's contributions.

Next, I will look into **section III (Dataset Description)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the CloudCast dataset. Here, they specify that the dataset includes 70,080 cloud-labeled satellite images with 10 different cloud types, collected over a specific time period (2017-01-01 to 2018-12-31) with a spatial resolution of 928 x 1530 pixels and 15-minute intervals. This section is crucial as it provides the necessary details about the dataset's structure and content.

Additionally, I will check the **related work** section to see if the authors mention any other datasets that are relevant to their research. They reference existing datasets for cloud forecasting, such as the ECMWF operational model, which serves as a comparison point for their dataset. However, the focus remains on the CloudCast dataset.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned. The CloudCast dataset itself is the primary focus, and the authors do not provide a separate citation for it since it is their own contribution. However, they reference the ECMWF model, which is relevant for comparison:

- For the **ECMWF operational model**, the citation is:
  > European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). "ECMWF Operational Multi-layer Cloud Cover." Available: https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/media-centre/news/2016/new-forecast-model-cycle-brings-highest-ever-resolution. Accessed: 2019-09-07.

Since the CloudCast dataset is a novel contribution, I will note that it can be cited as follows:
- For the **CloudCast dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nielsen, A. H., IosiÔ¨Ådis, A., & Karstoft, H. (2021). "CloudCast: A Satellite-Based Dataset and Baseline for Forecasting Clouds." IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing. DOI: 10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3062936.

Finally, I will summarize the extracted datasets, ensuring to include the full citations as required. The focus will be on the CloudCast dataset, as it is the primary dataset introduced in the paper, along with the ECMWF model for context.

After compiling this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
