To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Neural Framework for Image Caption Generation Using GRU-Based Attention Mechanism" by Rashid Khan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved competitive performance on the **MSCOCO dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any additional context or details about the datasets used. The authors mention that they utilize the **MSCOCO dataset** for quantitative validation, which reinforces its importance in their experiments.

In the **experimental setup section (Section 4)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the **MSCOCO dataset**. They state that it contains 82,783 training images, 40,504 validation images, and 40,775 test images, with each image having five human-annotated captions. This section confirms that the MSCOCO dataset is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the MSCOCO dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **MSCOCO Dataset**:
  > Lin, T. Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., ... & Zitnick, C. L. (2014, September). Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context. In European conference on computer vision (pp. 740-755). Springer, Cham.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the MSCOCO dataset, I will create an entry for it, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details about the dataset used in the research.
