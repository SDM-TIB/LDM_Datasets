To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A New GAN-based End-to-End TTS Training Algorithm" by Haohan Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract discusses the performance improvements in TTS (Text-to-Speech) systems but does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will then move to the **methods** section, where the authors describe their approach in detail.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using an **American English speech dataset** that consists of 14 hours of speech recorded by a single female speaker. This indicates that there is a specific dataset used for their experiments, but I need to find the full citation for this dataset.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if there is a specific citation for the American English speech dataset. However, it appears that the dataset is not explicitly cited in the references. Since the authors do not provide a formal citation, I will note that the dataset is described as a proprietary dataset used for their experiments.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, particularly in the context of the experiments or comparisons made. The authors reference various models and algorithms, but they do not specify additional datasets beyond the American English speech dataset.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the findings:

1. **American English Speech Dataset**: This dataset consists of 14 hours of speech recorded by a single female speaker. Unfortunately, there is no formal citation provided in the paper for this dataset.

Since the paper does not provide a full citation for the dataset, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset used in their experiments without a specific reference.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry based on the information I have gathered, ensuring to highlight the lack of a formal citation for the American English speech dataset.
