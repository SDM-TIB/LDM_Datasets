To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accelerometer-based Bed Occupancy Detection for Automatic, Non-invasive Long-term Cough Monitoring" by Madhurananda Pahar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that a **249-hour dataset of manually-labelled acceleration signals** was compiled from seven patients, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for the study.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly **Section 3 (Data)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of continuous accelerometer measurements from seven patients, collected over a period of 249 hours. They also provide specifics about the data collection setup, including the use of a smartphone attached to the bed and the annotation process using video recordings.

In **Section 3.3 (Compiled dataset)**, the authors summarize the dataset, stating that it includes 249 hours of data, with patients occupying their beds for only 95.5 hours and a total of 104 occupancy changes identified. This section confirms the dataset's characteristics and its relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, as it appears to be a novel compilation created for this study. However, I will note that the dataset is derived from a clinical setting involving patients undergoing treatment for tuberculosis.

Since the dataset is unique to this research, I will create a citation entry for it as follows:

- **Dataset**: Manually-labelled acceleration signals from seven patients undergoing treatment for tuberculosis.
  - **Citation**: Pahar, M., Miranda, I., Diacon, A., & Niesler, T. (2023). Accelerometer-based Bed Occupancy Detection for Automatic, Non-invasive Long-term Cough Monitoring. *[Journal Name]*, *[Volume]*, *[Page Numbers]*. [DOI or URL if available].

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the citation is included for reference.
