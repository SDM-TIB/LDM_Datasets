To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Hierarchical Neural Autoencoder for Paragraphs and Documents" by Jiwei Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I need to look for specific dataset names and details in the main body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Hotel Reviews**: This dataset consists of a subset of hotel reviews crawled from TripAdvisor, containing approximately 340,000 training reviews and 40,000 testing reviews. The authors specify that they only include reviews with sentences ranging from 50 to 250 words and maintain a vocabulary of the 25,000 most frequent words.

2. **Wikipedia**: This dataset is extracted from the Wikipedia corpus, also adhering to the same length requirements as the hotel reviews. The training dataset comprises roughly 500,000 paragraphs, while the testing set contains about 50,000 paragraphs. The vocabulary for this dataset includes the top 120,000 words.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. However, it appears that the datasets themselves do not have dedicated citations listed in the references, as they are derived from publicly available sources (TripAdvisor for hotel reviews and Wikipedia for the Wikipedia dataset). Therefore, I will create citations based on the sources:

- For the **Hotel Reviews dataset**, I will cite it as:
  > TripAdvisor. *TripAdvisor Hotel Reviews Dataset*. Available at: [https://www.tripadvisor.com](https://www.tripadvisor.com).

- For the **Wikipedia dataset**, I will cite it as:
  > Wikipedia. *Wikipedia Corpus*. Available at: [https://www.wikipedia.org](https://www.wikipedia.org).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their respective citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that the dataset descriptions are clear and concise, and that the citations are properly formatted.
