To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LBDMIDS: LSTM Based Deep Learning Model for Intrusion Detection Systems for IoT Networks" by Kumar Saurabh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their models on the **UNSW-NB15** and **Bot-IoT** datasets, which suggests these are the primary datasets used in their research.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Dataset Explanation)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they explicitly describe:

1. **UNSW-NB15 Dataset**: This dataset is widely used for evaluating Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) and contains 49 features and a total of 2,540,044 records across 4 CSV files. It includes 10 class labels, with 9 types of botnet attack vectors and 1 normal class.

2. **Bot-IoT Dataset**: Created in 2019, this dataset includes network and botnet traffic, containing 47 features and a total of 72 million records. It also includes a pre-selected training and testing dataset with 3.6 million records.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **UNSW-NB15 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Moustafa, Nour, and Jill Slay. "UNSW-NB15: a comprehensive data set for network intrusion detection systems (UNSW-NB15 network data set)." 2015 Military Communications and Information Systems Conference (MilCIS), 2015, pp. 1-6, doi: 10.1109/MilCIS.2015.7348942.

- For the **Bot-IoT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Koroniotis, Nickolaos, Moustafa, Nour, Sitnikova, Elena, and Turnbull, Benjamin. "Towards the Development of Realistic Botnet Dataset in the Internet of Things for Network Forensic Analytics: Bot-IoT Dataset." 2018.

Now that I have the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
