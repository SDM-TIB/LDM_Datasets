To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HorNet: Efficient High-Order Spatial Interactions with Recursive Gated Convolutions" by Yongming Rao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract highlights that extensive experiments were conducted on **ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and ADE20K semantic segmentation**, indicating that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, particularly subsections that detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. In section 4.1, the authors mention using **ImageNet** for classification, **COCO** for object detection, and **ADE20K** for semantic segmentation. This confirms that these datasets are integral to their research.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **ImageNet**:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248–255, 2009.

2. **COCO**:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollar, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755, 2014.

3. **ADE20K**:
   > Bolei Zhou, Hang Zhao, Xavier Puig, Sanja Fidler, Adela Barriuso, and Antonio Torralba. *Scene parsing through ADE20K dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 633–641, 2017.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete for further processing or review.
