To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Genetic Neural Architecture Search for automatic assessment of human sperm images" by Erfan Miahi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to the **MHSMA dataset**, which is a collection of sperm images used for their experiments. This indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will examine **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors discuss the challenges of sperm morphology analysis and mention the **MHSMA dataset** again, providing context for its use in their research. This section reinforces the importance of the dataset in their study.

In **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, the authors provide detailed information about the **MHSMA dataset**. They describe it as containing 1,540 grayscale images of sperm, collected from various patients, and labeled with four binary labels: tail and neck, vacuole, head, and acrosome. This section is crucial as it gives specifics about the dataset's composition and structure.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **MHSMA dataset**. The authors attribute the dataset to a previous work by Javadi and Mirroshandel (2019), which is essential for proper citation.

The citation for the **MHSMA dataset** is:
> Javadi, S., & Mirroshandel, S.A. (2019). A novel deep learning method for automatic assessment of human sperm images. *Computers in Biology and Medicine*, 109, 182-194.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify the dataset.
2. Examine the methods section for detailed descriptions.
3. Locate the full citation in the references for proper attribution.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant details about the dataset used in the research paper.
