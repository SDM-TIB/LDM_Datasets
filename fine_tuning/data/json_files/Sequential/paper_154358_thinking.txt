To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AttentiveNAS: Improving Neural Architecture Search via Attentive Sampling" by Dilin Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the AttentiveNAS models on ImageNet, which suggests that ImageNet is a dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors detail their methodology and results, which often includes the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize results, as they may also reference datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **ImageNet dataset** for their experiments. This dataset is crucial for evaluating the performance of neural architectures in the context of image classification tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The citation for the ImageNet dataset is as follows:
> Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248â€“255. IEEE, 2009.

Since the paper primarily discusses the ImageNet dataset, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, confirming that the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper is the ImageNet dataset, and I will prepare to present this information in the specified format.
