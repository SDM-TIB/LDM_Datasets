To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Learning Approach for Network-wide Dynamic Traffic Prediction during Hurricane Evacuation" by Rezaur Rahman and Samiul Hasan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and data collection sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves traffic data collected during Hurricane Irma's evacuation, which suggests that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **data collection section** (Section 5), where the authors describe the datasets used for their analysis. They mention collecting traffic detector data from the Regional Integrated Transportation Information System (RITIS) during the evacuation period of Hurricane Irma, specifically from September 4 to September 9, 2017. This is a key dataset.

Additionally, they mention that they collected non-evacuation period traffic volume data from May 1 to August 31, 2017. This dataset is also crucial for understanding the model's performance.

In the **zonal level mandatory evacuation section**, the authors describe how they collected data on the time and location of evacuation orders issued for different areas during Hurricane Irma. This data is essential for understanding the context of the traffic patterns during the evacuation.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets based on the information provided in the paper and any relevant references:

1. **Traffic Detector Data**: 
   - Collected from the Regional Integrated Transportation Information System (RITIS) during Hurricane Irma's evacuation from September 4 to September 9, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
