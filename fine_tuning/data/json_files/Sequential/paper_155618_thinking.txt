To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A CNN-LSTM-BASED HYBRID DEEP LEARNING APPROACH TO DETECT SENTIMENT POLARITIES ON MONKEYPOX TWEETS" by Krishna Kumar Mohbey et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study focuses on analyzing sentiments from tweets related to monkeypox, which suggests that a dataset of tweets is involved.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experimental results)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their analysis. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of **61,379 tweets** about monkeypox collected from Twitter between May 7 and June 11, 2022. This is a clear identification of the dataset.

I will also look for any additional details about the dataset, such as its source and characteristics. The authors specify that the dataset includes tweets expressing positive, negative, and neutral sentiments, which is important for understanding its structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- For the monkeypox tweet dataset, the citation is:
  > Thakur, N. (2022). MonkeyPox2022Tweets: The First Public Twitter Dataset on the 2022 MonkeyPox Outbreak. Preprints 2022, 2022060172. doi: 10.20944/preprints202206.0172.v1.

With this information, I will summarize the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation as required. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
