To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explain Thyself Bully: Sentiment Aided Cyberbullying Detection with Explanation" by Krishanu Maity et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors have introduced **BullyExplain**, a benchmark dataset for explainable cyberbullying detection in code-mixed language. This is a clear indication that a dataset is present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (BullyExplain Dataset Development)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the BullyExplain dataset was developed by re-annotating the existing **BullySent dataset** with additional labels for rationales and target classes. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

In this section, the authors specify that the BullyExplain dataset contains 6,084 samples, with annotations for bully labels, sentiment labels, target classes, and rationales. This comprehensive description confirms the dataset's significance and usage in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the full citations of the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the **BullySent dataset** as the basis for their new dataset. I will locate the citation for the BullySent dataset in the **References section** of the paper. 

The citation for the BullySent dataset is:
> Maity, K., Saha, S. (2021). *A multi-task model for sentiment aided cyberbullying detection in code-mixed Indian languages*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Neural Information Processing, pp. 440–451.

Since the BullyExplain dataset is derived from BullySent, I will cite it as follows:
- **BullyExplain Dataset**: 
  > Maity, K., Jha, P., Jain, R., Saha, S., & Bhattacharyya, P. (2023). *Explain Thyself Bully: Sentiment Aided Cyberbullying Detection with Explanation*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Neural Information Processing.

- **BullySent Dataset**: 
  > Maity, K., Saha, S. (2021). *A multi-task model for sentiment aided cyberbullying detection in code-mixed Indian languages*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Neural Information Processing, pp. 440–451.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited for future reference. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
