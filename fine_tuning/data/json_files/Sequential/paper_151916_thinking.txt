To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cortical microcircuits as gated-recurrent neural networks" by Rui Ponte Costa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, particularly the subsections that detail the experiments conducted. In this paper, the authors mention using datasets for sequential image classification and language modeling tasks. Specifically, they refer to the **Penn Treebank** and **Wikitext-2** datasets for language modeling, and the **MNIST** dataset for sequential image classification.

I will then look for specific details about each dataset, such as the number of samples, the type of data, and any relevant characteristics. The authors provide information on how the MNIST dataset is used in their experiments, describing it as a sequence of pixels from digit images. For the Penn Treebank and Wikitext-2 datasets, they mention the number of training, validation, and test words, along with vocabulary sizes.

After gathering the necessary information, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

The citations I will extract are:

1. **Penn Treebank**:
   > Marcus, M. P., Marcinkiewicz, M. A., & Santorini, B. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: the Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313-330.

2. **Wikitext-2**:
   > Merity, S., Xiong, C., Bradbury, J., & Socher, R. (2016). Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.07843*.

3. **MNIST**:
   > Le, Q. V., Jaitly, N., & Hinton, G. E. (2015). A Simple Way to Initialize Recurrent Networks of Rectified Linear Units. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.00941*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their relevant details as presented in the research paper.
