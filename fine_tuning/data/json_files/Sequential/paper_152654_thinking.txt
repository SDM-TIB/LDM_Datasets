To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extractive Summary as Discrete Latent Variables" by Aran Komatsuzaki, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions comparing various methods for text compression, which may imply the use of datasets for evaluation. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned.

In the **introduction**, I will look for references to datasets used in previous works or any datasets that the authors might have utilized for their experiments. If the authors reference any specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section** where the authors describe their approach. This section often contains details about the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, I will check for any datasets that were used to validate the proposed methods. The authors may provide details about the datasets, including how they were preprocessed or any specific splits used for training and testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the **EMNLP2017 WMT Dataset**, I will look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is not explicitly cited, I will search for the original paper or source that introduced the dataset to ensure I provide an accurate citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ready for review or further processing.
