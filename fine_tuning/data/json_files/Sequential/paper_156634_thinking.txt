To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "SGRU: A High-Performance Structured Gated Recurrent Unit for Traffic Flow Prediction" by Wenfeng Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that they evaluate their approach on **four publicly available California traffic datasets**. This indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to find.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section V (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. They mention:

1. **PeMS03**: This dataset consists of 358 nodes and 26,209 time steps, starting from September 1, 2018.
2. **PeMS04**: This dataset has 307 nodes and 16,992 time steps, starting from January 1, 2018.
3. **PeMS07**: This dataset includes 883 nodes and 28,224 time steps, starting from May 1, 2017.
4. **PeMS08**: This dataset contains 170 nodes and 17,856 time steps, starting from July 1, 2016.

The authors provide a brief description of each dataset, including the number of nodes and time steps, which is crucial for understanding their structure and purpose.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The PeMS datasets are typically referenced in the context of traffic flow prediction and are associated with the Performance Measurement System (PeMS) of the California highway network. The citation for the PeMS datasets is:

- For **PeMS datasets**, the citation is:

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
