To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "Bidirectional LSTM-CRF Models for Sequence Tagging" by Zhiheng Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their models on various NLP benchmark sequence tagging datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three specific datasets:

1. **Penn TreeBank (PTB) for POS tagging**: This dataset is commonly used for part-of-speech tagging tasks and is well-known in the NLP community.

2. **CoNLL 2000 for chunking**: This dataset is used for the task of chunking, which involves identifying phrases in text.

3. **CoNLL 2003 for named entity recognition (NER)**: This dataset is widely used for named entity recognition tasks, where the goal is to identify and classify named entities in text.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the experiments.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Penn TreeBank (PTB)**, the citation is:
  > Marcus, M. P., Santorini, B., & Marcinkiewicz, M. A. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn TreeBank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313-330.

- For **CoNLL 2000**, the citation is:
  > T. Kudo and Y. Matsumoto. (2000). Use of support vector learning for chunk identification. *Proceedings of CoNLL*.

- For **CoNLL 2003**, the citation is:
  > T. Florian, A. Ittycheriah, H. Jing, and T. Zhang. (2003). Named entity recognition through classifier combination. *Proceedings of NAACL-HLT*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately and comprehensively.
