To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HM-NAS: Efficient Neural Architecture Search via Hierarchical Masking" by Shen Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions evaluating HM-NAS on **CIFAR-10** and **ImageNet**, which indicates that these datasets are likely to be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will specifically focus on the subsections that detail the experimental setup and results. 

In **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, the authors mention using **CIFAR-10** and **ImageNet** for their experiments. They provide details about the number of classes and images in these datasets, which confirms their usage in the study.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset of images*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255, 2009.

Having gathered this information, I will now summarize the datasets identified:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset containing over 1.2 million images across 1,000 classes.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
