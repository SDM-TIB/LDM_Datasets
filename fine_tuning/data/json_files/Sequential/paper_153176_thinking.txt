To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning Based Energy Disaggregation and On/Off Detection of Household Appliances" by Jie Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize a real-world energy dataset collected from 20 households over two years, which suggests that a specific dataset is being referenced.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors mention two large-scale household energy consumption datasets: **UK-DALE** and **REFIT**. This is a strong indication that these datasets are crucial to their research.

In the **experiments** section, the authors explicitly state that they conducted their evaluations using the **REFIT dataset**. They describe the dataset as a collection of energy consumption data from 20 households in the UK, recorded every 8 seconds over a period of more than two years. This confirms that the REFIT dataset is central to their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to obtain the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations I need to extract are:

1. For the **REFIT dataset**, the citation is:
   > David Murray, Lina Stankovic, and Vladimir Stankovic. *An electrical load measurements dataset of United Kingdom households from a two-year longitudinal study*. Scientific Data (2017).

2. For the **UK-DALE dataset**, the citation is:
   > Jack Kelly and William Knottenbelt. *The UK-DALE dataset, domestic appliance-level electricity demand and whole-house demand from five UK homes*. Scientific Data 2, 150007 (2015).

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **REFIT Dataset**: A collection of energy consumption data from 20 households in the UK, recorded every 8 seconds over two years, focusing on both house-level and appliance-level energy usage.

- **UK-DALE Dataset**: A dataset providing domestic appliance-level electricity demand and whole-house demand from five UK homes, which has been instrumental in energy disaggregation research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
