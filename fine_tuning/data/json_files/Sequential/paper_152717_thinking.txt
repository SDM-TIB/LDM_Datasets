To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tensor-Train Long Short-Term Memory for Monaural Speech Enhancement" by Suman Samui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a "deep TensorNet model for single-channel speech enhancement," which suggests that datasets may be involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors describe the audio material used for their experiments. They mention that the clean speech material is taken from the **TIMIT** and **Voice Bank** corpora. This is a clear indication that these are datasets used in their research.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors provide details about the training and validation sets, specifying that they consist of 5250 and 2750 utterances, respectively, from the Voice Bank and TIMIT datasets. This further confirms the use of these datasets.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** of these datasets in the **References section** of the paper:

1. For the **TIMIT dataset**, the citation is:
   > J. S. Garofolo, L. F. Lamel, W. M. Fisher, J. G. Fiscus, and D. S. Pallett. *DARPA TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus CD-ROM. NIST Speech Disc 1-1.1*. NASA STI/Recon Technical Report N, vol. 93, 1993.

2. For the **Voice Bank corpus**, the citation is:
   > C. Veaux, J. Yamagishi, and S. King. *The Voice Bank Corpus: Design, Collection and Data Analysis of a Large Regional Accent Speech Database*. In Proceedings of the 2013 International Conference on Asian Spoken Language Research and Evaluation (O-COCOSDA/CASLRE), 2013, pp. 1–4.

Additionally, the authors mention using noise instances from the **DEMAND database** for creating noisy stimuli. I will also include this dataset:

3. For the **DEMAND database**, the citation is:
   > J. Thiemann, N. Ito, and E. Vincent. *The Diverse Environments Multi-Channel Acoustic Noise Database: A Database of Multichannel Environmental Noise Recordings*. The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, vol. 133, no. 5, pp. 3591–3591, 2013.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be clearly documented with its full citation to ensure proper attribution.
