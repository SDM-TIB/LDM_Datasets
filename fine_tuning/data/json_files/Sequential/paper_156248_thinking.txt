To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fully Embedded Time-Series Generative Adversarial Networks" by Joe Beck and Subhadeep Chakraborty, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Experimental Setup & Datasets)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention three primary datasets:

1. **Sines Dataset**: A one-dimensional dataset generated with sequences of length T = 100, where amplitude, frequency, and phase are sampled from a uniform distribution.

2. **Google Stocks Dataset**: A six-dimensional historical dataset containing stock price information from 2004 to 2019.

3. **UCI Appliances Energy Dataset**: A six-dimensional dataset that includes energy usage data.

4. **UCI Metro Interstate Dataset**: Real-valued traffic and weather data.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper provides citations for the UCI Appliances Energy Dataset and the UCI Metro Interstate Dataset:

- For the **UCI Appliances Energy Dataset**, the citation is:
  > L. M. Candanedo, V. Feldheim, and D. Deramaix. "Data driven prediction models of energy use of appliances in a low-energy house." *Energy and Buildings*, vol. 140, pp. 81â€“97, Apr. 2017.

- For the **UCI Metro Interstate Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Hogue. "Traffic data from mn department of transportation, weather data from openweathermap." 2018.

The Google Stocks Dataset is mentioned as being provided directly in the code repository, so I will note that it does not have a formal citation in the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the datasets that have them. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for any downstream processing or review.
