To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing streamflow forecast and extracting insights using long-short term memory networks with data integration at continental scales" by Dapeng Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested a method on a dataset, which suggests that there is a specific dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Data and Methods)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their study. In this section, they mention the **Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-sample Studies (CAMELS)** dataset, which is crucial for their analysis. The authors provide details about this dataset, including its composition and the number of catchments it covers.

The paper states that the CAMELS dataset consists of basin-averaged hydrometeorological time series, catchment attributes, and streamflow observations from USGS for **671 catchments** across the Continental United States (CONUS). This dataset is essential for their experiments and model training.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CAMELS dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Addor, N., Newman, A. J., Mizukami, N., & Clark, M. P. (2017). Catchment attributes for large-sample studies. Boulder, CO: UCAR/NCAR. https://doi.org/10.5065/D6G73C3Q

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-sample Studies (CAMELS)
   - **Description**: This dataset includes basin-averaged hydrometeorological time series, catchment attributes, and streamflow observations from USGS for 671 catchments over the Continental United States (CONUS).
   - **Citation**: Addor, N., Newman, A. J., Mizukami, N., & Clark, M. P. (2017). Catchment attributes for large-sample studies. Boulder, CO: UCAR/NCAR. https://doi.org/10.5065/D6G73C3Q

With this information, I am ready to compile the dataset entry into the required format for further processing or review.
