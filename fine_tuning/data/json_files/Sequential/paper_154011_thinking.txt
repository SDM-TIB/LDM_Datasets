To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Entanglement-Embedded Recurrent Network Architecture: Tensorized Latent State Propagation and Chaos Forecasting" by Xiangyi Meng and Tong Yang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention testing their model on various chaotic time series datasets, including:

1. **Lorenz System**: A well-known chaotic system used for time series forecasting.
2. **Logistic Map**: A simple one-dimensional discrete-time map that exhibits chaotic behavior.
3. **Hénon Map**: A two-dimensional chaotic map.
4. **Chirikov Standard Map**: Another chaotic map used in the experiments.
5. **Rössler System**: A three-dimensional chaotic system.
6. **Dufing Oscillator System**: A system that exhibits chaotic behavior under certain conditions.
7. **Thomas’ Cyclically Symmetric System**: A chaotic dynamical system known for its cyclic symmetry.
8. **Real-World Weather Data**: Includes datasets for pressure and mean wind speed.

I will then check the **Appendix** for any additional details on how these datasets were constructed or any specific parameters used in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets that are based on prior work or established datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution.

For example, the citations for the chaotic systems might not be explicitly listed in the references, as they are often well-known systems in the literature. However, for the real-world datasets, I will ensure to note the source, which in this case is Mathematica’s WeatherData function.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation where applicable. This will include:

Finally, I will ensure that all this information is organized and ready for downstream processing or review.
