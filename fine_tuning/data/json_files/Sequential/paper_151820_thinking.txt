To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Spatiotemporal Models for Robust Proprioceptive Terrain Classification" by Abhinav Valada and Wolfram Burgard, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two extensive datasets collected with different microphones on various terrains, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **data collection and labeling section** (Section 4), where the authors describe their data collection methodology. Here, they mention that they collected over 15 hours of vehicle-terrain interaction data from six different outdoor terrains and three different indoor terrains. This section is likely to provide the names and details of the datasets used.

Upon reviewing Section 4, I find that the authors refer to two datasets:
1. **Dataset collected with a shotgun microphone**: This dataset includes various indoor and outdoor terrains, but the authors do not provide a specific name for this dataset.
2. **Dataset collected with a mobile phone microphone**: Similar to the first dataset, this dataset is also not given a specific name.

Since the datasets are described in terms of the collection method and the types of terrains, I will note that while the datasets are not explicitly named, they are significant for the experiments conducted.

Next, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets. The authors mention using the **Diverse Environments Multichannel Acoustic Noise Database (DEMAND)** for their noise-aware training scheme. The citation for this dataset is:
> Thiemann, J., Ito, N., & Vincent, E. (2013). The diverse environments multi-channel acoustic noise database (demand): A database of multichannel environmental noise recordings. In 21st International Congress on Acoustics.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:
- **Dataset 1**: Vehicle-terrain interaction data collected with a shotgun microphone (no specific citation).
- **Dataset 2**: Vehicle-terrain interaction data collected with a mobile phone microphone (no specific citation).
- **Diverse Environments Multichannel Acoustic Noise Database (DEMAND)**: 
  > Thiemann, J., Ito, N., & Vincent, E. (2013). The diverse environments multi-channel acoustic noise database (demand): A database of multichannel environmental noise recordings. In 21st International Congress on Acoustics.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations where applicable, and prepare them for structured output.
