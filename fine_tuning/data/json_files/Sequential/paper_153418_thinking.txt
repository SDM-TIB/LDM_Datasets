To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Latent Process from High-Dimensional Event Sequences via Efficient Sampling" by Qitian Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the modeling of latent dynamics in high-dimensional marked event sequences and mentions experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets. This indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will move to the **introduction** section. Here, the authors describe the context of their work and mention the challenges of modeling event sequences. They also refer to the use of synthetic datasets and real-world datasets for their experiments, but I need to locate the exact names of these datasets.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for specific mentions of datasets. The authors state that they conducted experiments on two synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets. They name the synthetic datasets as **Syn-Small** and **Syn-Large**, which are generated from networks of different sizes. For the real-world datasets, they mention the **MemeTracker dataset** and the **Weibo dataset**. 

Now, I will gather detailed descriptions of each dataset:

1. **Syn-Small**: This dataset is generated from a small network with 1,000 nodes, where directed edges are sampled using a Bernoulli distribution. The dataset contains 10,000 event sequences.

2. **Syn-Large**: This dataset is generated from a larger network with 100,000 nodes, also using a Bernoulli distribution for directed edges. It contains 100,000 event sequences.

3. **MemeTracker dataset**: This dataset contains hyperlinks between articles and records information flow from one site to another, with a filtered network of 583 sites and 6,700 cascades.

4. **Weibo dataset**: This dataset records resharing behaviors among 1,787,443 users, with 413,503 following edges. The authors extracted data from 105 users with 2,531,525 edges and 105 cascades.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the synthetic datasets are generated by the authors and do not have external citations, I will focus on the real-world datasets:

- For the **MemeTracker dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Gomez-Rodriguez, D. Balduzzi, and B. Schölkopf. *Uncovering the temporal dynamics of diffusion networks*. In ICML, pages 561–568, 2011.

- For the **Weibo dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Zhang, J. Tang, J. Li, Y. Liu, and C. Xing. *Who influenced you? predicting retweet via social influence locality*. TKDD, 9(3):25:1–25:26, 2015.

Now that I have identified and documented the datasets along with their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.
