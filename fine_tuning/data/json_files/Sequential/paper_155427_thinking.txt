To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An advanced spatio-temporal convolutional recurrent neural network for storm surge predictions" by Ehsan Adeli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study leverages a "database of synthetic storm simulations," which suggests that there is a dataset involved. I will note this as a potential dataset source.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Storm Surge Prediction Problem Characteristics)**, where the authors discuss the synthetic storm simulations used for training and testing their machine learning models. They mention that the database corresponds to synthetic storm simulations for the greater Coastal Texas region, which is crucial information.

In this section, the authors specify that the database includes a total of **4800 save points (SPs)** and that **500 storms** will be used for calibration, with an additional **8 storms** for validation. This provides a clear description of the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also look for any references to the source of this dataset. The authors acknowledge the **Army Corps of Engineers, Coastal Hydraulics Laboratory of the Engineering Research and Development Center** for providing access to the storm surge data through the Coastal Hazards System. This acknowledgment is essential for citing the dataset properly.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

1. **Dataset Name**: Synthetic Storm Surge Database
   - **Description**: A database of synthetic storm simulations for the greater Coastal Texas region, containing 4800 save points (SPs) and used for training and testing a convolutional recurrent neural network model.
   - **Citation**: Army Corps of Engineers, Coastal Hydraulics Laboratory of the Engineering Research and Development Center. Coastal Hazards System. Available at: https://chs.erdc.dren.mil/

Next, I will check the **References section** to ensure that I have captured any additional datasets mentioned in the paper. However, it appears that the primary dataset discussed is the synthetic storm surge database.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to format them according to the required structure, ensuring that I have included the full citation for the dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution and future reference.
