To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CNN+LSTM Architecture for Speech Emotion Recognition with Data Augmentation" by Caroline Etienne et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of the **IEMOCAP dataset** for recognizing emotions in speech, which indicates that this is a key dataset for the research.

Next, I will look into **section 1.1 (Dataset description)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the IEMOCAP dataset. They explain that it consists of twelve hours of audio and video recordings performed by 10 professional actors, organized into sessions of dialogues, and that each utterance is assigned an emotion label. This section confirms that the IEMOCAP dataset is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the IEMOCAP dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **IEMOCAP Dataset**: 
  > C. Busso, M. Bulut, C.-C. Lee, A. Kazemzadeh, E. Mower, S. Kim, J. N. Chang, S. Lee, and S. S. Narayanan. *IEMOCAP: Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture Database*. Language Resources and Evaluation, vol. 42, no. 4, pp. 335â€“359, 2008.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the IEMOCAP dataset, I will ensure to highlight its significance in the context of the research findings and methodologies discussed throughout the paper.

After gathering all necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry for the IEMOCAP dataset, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper attribution. This will allow for a structured presentation of the dataset in any subsequent output or documentation.
