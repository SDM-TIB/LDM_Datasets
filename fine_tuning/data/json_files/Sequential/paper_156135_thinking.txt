To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DTW K-MEANS CLUSTERING FOR FAULT DETECTION IN PHOTOVOLTAIC MODULES" by Edgar Hernando Sep√∫lveda Oviedo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or implied. The introduction discusses the need for detecting faults in photovoltaic (PV) plants, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets at this point.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors describe their approach. They mention capturing the electric current signals from PV panels, but they do not specify a particular dataset. Instead, they describe the process of acquiring data and applying the DTW K-means algorithm.

In the **results section**, the authors present findings based on the current signals from 12 different PV panels. However, they do not provide a formal dataset name or reference. The results are validated through visual inspection, but again, no specific dataset is cited.

In the **discussion section**, the authors reflect on the performance of their method and mention the types of faults detected, but they still do not reference any formal datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any named datasets or provide citations for them, I will conclude that there are no formal datasets to extract from this paper. The data used appears to be original data collected from PV panels for the purpose of this study, rather than a publicly available dataset.

Now, I will summarize my findings:
- No specific datasets were identified in the paper.
- The data used for the experiments seems to be original data collected by the authors from PV panels.

Since there are no datasets to cite, I will not create any dataset entries or citations. Instead, I will note that the research relies on original data collection rather than established datasets.
