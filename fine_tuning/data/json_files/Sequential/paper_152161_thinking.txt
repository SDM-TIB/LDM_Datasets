To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Audio Synthesis of Musical Notes with WaveNet Autoencoders" by Jesse Engel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of **NSynth**, a large-scale dataset of musical notes, which indicates that this is a key dataset to focus on. The introduction further emphasizes the significance of NSynth in advancing audio modeling, confirming its importance.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the dataset is discussed in detail in **section 3 (The NSynth Dataset)**. Here, the authors describe NSynth as consisting of approximately 306,043 musical notes sampled from around 1,006 harmonic musical instruments, which is crucial information for my extraction.

In this section, the authors provide specific details about the dataset, including its size, the nature of the audio snippets, and the annotations associated with each note. This information is essential for a comprehensive description of the dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the NSynth dataset. The paper provides a link to the dataset's availability, which is important for referencing:
- **NSynth Dataset**: The dataset is available for download at https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/nsynth as TFRecord files split into training and holdout sets.

The citation for the NSynth dataset is not explicitly provided in the references, but I can construct it based on the authors and the context given in the paper. The citation can be formatted as follows:
> Engel, Jesse, Resnick, Cinjon, Roberts, Adam, Dieleman, Sander, Eck, Douglas, Simonyan, Karen, and Norouzi, Mohammad. *Neural Audio Synthesis of Musical Notes with WaveNet Autoencoders*. Available at: https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/nsynth.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for NSynth, ensuring that I include all relevant details such as the dataset's purpose, size, and the authors' citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further, ensuring that the citation is clear and complete.
