To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Module G2P Converter for Persian Focusing on Relations between Words" by Mahdi Rezaei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it is in the introduction where the authors typically discuss the context and significance of their work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors mention using a portion of the **Bijankhan corpus**, which is a well-known dataset for Persian G2P tasks. They describe it as consisting of 42,540 sentences and one million words with phonemic transcriptions, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

Additionally, the authors reference the **Ariana lexicon** in section 4.1, which is used for tagging words in the Bijankhan corpus and serves as a pronunciation dictionary. This lexicon is also significant for the G2P conversion task, so I will include it as a dataset as well.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Bijankhan corpus**, the citation is:
   > Bijankhan, Mahmood, Javad Sheykhzadegan, Mohammad Bahrani, and Masood Ghayoomi. "Lessons from building a Persian written corpus: Peykare." Language resources and evaluation 45, no. 2 (2011): 143-164.

2. For the **Ariana lexicon**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation, I will note that it is a resource used in the study. If the authors had provided a reference, I would include it here.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Bijankhan corpus**: A dataset consisting of 42,540 sentences and one million words with phonemic transcriptions, used for training and evaluating the G2P system.
- **Ariana lexicon**: A pronunciation dictionary used for tagging words in the Bijankhan corpus, containing word entries with phoneme transcriptions and POS tags.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the citations are accurately represented.
