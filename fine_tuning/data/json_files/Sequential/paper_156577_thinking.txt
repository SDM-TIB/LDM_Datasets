To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Persian Slang Text Conversion to Formal and Deep Learning of Persian Short Texts on Social Media for Sentiment Classification" by Mohsen Khazenia et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used more than 10 million unlabeled texts from various social networks and movie subtitles, as well as 60,000 labeled texts from Instagram comments for sentiment classification. This suggests that there are significant datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used in their research. They categorize the data into unlabeled and labeled datasets:

1. **Unlabeled Data**: 
   - **Persian News Agencies**: 10,000,000 texts.
   - **Instagram Comments**: 6,000,000 texts.
   - **Movies Subtitles**: 4,000,000 texts.
   - **Telegram Groups**: 4,000,000 texts.
   - **Twitter Tweets**: 4,000,000 texts.
   - **Total Unlabeled Data**: 28,080,000 texts.

2. **Labeled Data**: 
   - **Instagram Comments**: 60,000 comments labeled as positive, negative, or neutral.

The paper also mentions that the labeled data was derived from Instagram comments, which were labeled by three users to ensure accuracy.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are derived from social media and news sources. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are based on publicly available data from social media platforms and news agencies, but specific citations for these datasets are not provided in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Persian News Agencies Dataset**: Contains 10,000,000 texts from various Persian news agencies.
2. **Instagram Comments Dataset**: Contains 6,000,000 comments from Instagram, with a subset of 60,000 labeled comments for sentiment analysis.
3. **Movies Subtitles Dataset**: Contains 4,000,000 texts from movie subtitles.
4. **Telegram Groups Dataset**: Contains 4,000,000 texts from Telegram groups.
5. **Twitter Tweets Dataset**: Contains 4,000,000 tweets from Twitter.

Since the paper does not provide specific citations for these datasets, I will note that they are based on publicly accessible data sources.

After compiling this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
