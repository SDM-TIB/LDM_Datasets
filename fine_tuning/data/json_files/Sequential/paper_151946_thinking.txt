To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convolutional Image Captioning" by Jyoti Aneja et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method's efficacy on the **MSCOCO dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will examine the **results and analysis sections** to confirm the use of the MSCOCO dataset and to see if any additional datasets are referenced. In the results section, the authors discuss their experiments and performance metrics, specifically mentioning the **MSCOCO dataset** multiple times, which reinforces its significance in their study.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MSCOCO dataset. The citation for the MSCOCO dataset is as follows:
> T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755, 2014.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the MSCOCO dataset and does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information into a structured format.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MSCOCO dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will be the only dataset entry extracted from this paper.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise dataset entry ready for further use or analysis.
