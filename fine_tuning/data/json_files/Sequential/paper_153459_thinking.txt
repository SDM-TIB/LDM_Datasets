To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Reinforcement Learn for Neural Architecture Search" by Jorge Gomez Robles and Joaquin Vanschoren, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their method to various datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention that they used a set of environments associated with standard image classification tasks on datasets sampled from a meta-dataset collection. They specifically list five datasets in **Table 3**.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **FGVC-Aircraft**: This dataset is used for validation and contains 100 classes with 10,000 observations.
2. **CUB-200-2011**: This dataset is also used for validation, consisting of 200 classes and 11,788 observations.
3. **Describable Textures Dataset (DTD)**: Used for training, it has 47 classes and 5,640 observations.
4. **Omniglot**: This dataset is used for training and contains 1,623 classes with 32,460 observations.
5. **VGG Flower**: Another training dataset with 102 classes and 8,189 observations.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper references the meta-dataset collection from Triantaﬁllou et al. (2019), which is the primary source for the datasets used in their experiments.

The full citation for the meta-dataset is:
> Eleni Triantaﬁllou, Tyler Zhu, Vincent Dumoulin, Pascal Lamblin, Kelvin Xu, Ross Goroshin, Carles Gelada, Kevin Swersky, Pierre-Antoine Manzagol, and Hugo Larochelle. *Meta-dataset: A dataset of datasets for learning to learn from few examples*. CoRR, abs/1903.03096, 2019. URL http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03096.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the dataset names, their usage, number of classes, number of observations, and the full citation for the meta-dataset.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
