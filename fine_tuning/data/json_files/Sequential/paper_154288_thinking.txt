To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prediction of Rainfall in Rajasthan, India using Deep and Wide Neural Networks" by Vikas Bajpai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used historical time-series data for rainfall prediction, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.2 (Dataset description and pre-processing)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used in their experiments. They mention that they collected daily rainfall data from 33 districts in Rajasthan over a period of 71 years (from 1957 to 2017) using data from rain-gauge stations installed by various departments, including the Hydrology Department and the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). This section is crucial as it provides specifics about the dataset.

The authors state that they used data from **158 rain-gauge stations** across Rajasthan, which is a significant detail. I will note the time span of the data (71 years) and the geographical coverage (33 districts).

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the data collected from the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and other local departments. I will ensure to include the citation for the IMD as it is the primary source of the rainfall data used in the study.

The citation for the dataset is as follows:
- **Indian Meteorological Department (IMD)**: The dataset is derived from the rainfall data collected by the IMD, which is a government agency responsible for meteorological observations and forecasts in India.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citation for the IMD dataset. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
