To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On combining acoustic and modulation spectrograms in an attention LSTM-based system for speech intelligibility level classification" by Ascensión Gallardo-Antolín and Juan M. Montero, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed models are evaluated with the **UA-Speech database**, which is a strong indication that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset used. In subsection 4.1, they mention the **UA-Speech database**, which consists of utterances pronounced by individuals with dysarthria and healthy control subjects. The authors specify that the database contains 11,435 files recorded at 16 KHz, and it has been manually annotated for intelligibility scores.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the UA-Speech database. The citation provided in the paper is:
> H. Kim, M. Hasegawa-Johnson, A. Perlman, J. Gunderson, T. S. Huang, K. Watkin, S. Frame. *Dysarthric speech database for universal access research*. In Proceedings of the 9th Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association (INTERSPEECH), ISCA, 2008, pages 1741–1744.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify potential datasets.
2. Confirm the dataset in the experiments section, specifically subsection 4.1.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references section.

This method ensures that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
