To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learned in Translation: Contextualized Word Vectors" by Bryan McCann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on various NLP tasks, which suggests that multiple datasets are likely involved. The introduction further elaborates on the use of machine translation data, indicating that datasets related to machine translation and other NLP tasks will be discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **Datasets section** (section 7) of the paper, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe several datasets for different tasks, including machine translation, sentiment classification, question classification, entailment, and question answering.

The datasets mentioned include:

1. **Multi30k**: A dataset for machine translation with 30,000 sentence pairs from Flickr captions.
2. **IWSLT 2016**: A medium-sized dataset with 209,772 sentence pairs from TED presentations.
3. **WMT 2017**: The largest dataset with approximately 7 million sentence pairs from various sources.
4. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**: Used for sentiment classification, with two versions (SST-2 and SST-5).
5. **IMDb**: A dataset for sentiment analysis consisting of movie reviews.
6. **TREC**: A dataset for question classification, with both TREC-6 and TREC-50 versions.
7. **Stanford Natural Language Inference Corpus (SNLI)**: Used for entailment classification.
8. **Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD)**: A dataset for question answering.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The citations I will extract include:

- **Multi30k**:
  > Specia, L., Frank, S., Sima’an, K., & Elliott, D. (2016). A shared task on multimodal machine translation and cross-lingual image description. In WMT.

- **IWSLT 2016**:

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details about the datasets used in the research.
