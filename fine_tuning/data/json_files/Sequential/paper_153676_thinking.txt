To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How to 0wn NAS in Your Spare Time" by Sanghyun Hong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the reconstruction of deep learning systems but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results sections**. These sections typically provide details about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention two key systems they reconstructed: **MalConv** and **ProxylessNAS-CPU**. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets used for training or evaluation in the context of these systems. Instead, the focus is on the architectures and the reconstruction process.

Since no datasets are explicitly named in the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. I will look for papers that might describe datasets related to the systems discussed.

In the references, I find the following relevant citations:

1. For **MalConv**, the citation is:
   > Raff, E., Barker, J., Sylvester, J., Brandon, R., Catanzaro, B., & Nicholas, C. K. (2018). *Malware detection by eating a whole exe*. In Workshops at the Thirty-Second AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

2. For **ProxylessNAS**, the citation is:
   > Cai, H., Zhu, L., & Han, S. (2019). *ProxylessNAS: Direct neural architecture search on target task and hardware*. In International Conference on Learning Representations.

Although these references do not provide datasets directly, they may lead to datasets used in their respective studies. I will note these citations as they are relevant to the systems discussed in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset or related work that could lead to datasets.

In summary, while the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I have identified relevant citations that may point to datasets used in the context of the discussed systems. I will document these citations accordingly.
