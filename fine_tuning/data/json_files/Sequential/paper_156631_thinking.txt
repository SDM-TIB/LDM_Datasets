To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Clustering and Data Augmentation to Improve Accuracy of Sleep Assessment and Sleep Individuality Analysis" by Shintaro Tamai et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the construction of a machine learning-based sleep assessment model, which suggests that data collection is involved, but I need to find specific dataset details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the data collection process. They mention that data was collected from participants who recorded their sleep sounds at home for one month using a smartphone. This indicates that the dataset is based on audio recordings of sleep sounds, along with participant questionnaires regarding their sleep satisfaction and environmental conditions.

The authors also provide details about the participants, including their age, gender, and the number of days they reported as satisfied or unsatisfied with their sleep. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and context.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works that are referenced. However, in this case, the dataset is primarily based on the authors' own data collection, so I will summarize it accordingly.

The dataset can be described as follows:

1. **Sleep Sound Dataset**: This dataset consists of audio recordings of sleep sounds collected from participants over one month. Participants recorded their sleep sounds in their private bedrooms using a smartphone and filled out questionnaires regarding their sleep satisfaction and environmental conditions. The dataset includes demographic information such as age and gender, as well as subjective ratings of sleep satisfaction on a five-point scale.

Since this dataset is original and created by the authors, I will not have a traditional citation for it. However, I will note that the dataset is part of the research conducted by the authors of the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that captures the essential details for future reference or processing.
