To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Specializing Word Embeddings (for Parsing) by Information Bottleneck" by Xiang Lisa Li and Jason Eisner, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of pre-trained word embeddings like ELMo and BERT, but I need to look for specific datasets that were utilized in the experiments. The introduction provides context about the task but may not explicitly mention datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup** and **results** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this paper, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as well as any text that describes their characteristics.

Upon reviewing the **Table 1** in the paper, I find that it lists several language treebanks used in the experiments. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **GSD (Universal Dependencies)**: This dataset is used for various languages, and the paper provides statistics such as the number of tokens and entropy of gold POS tags.

2. **AnCora**: Another dataset mentioned in the context of the experiments, specifically for the Spanish language.

3. **HDTB**: This dataset is referenced for Hindi.

4. **ISDT**: This dataset is mentioned for the English language.

5. **PADT**: This dataset is referenced for Arabic.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are typically included in the references of the paper, and I will ensure to extract them accurately.

For example, the citation for the Universal Dependencies datasets is:
> Nivre, J., et al. (2018). Universal Dependencies 2.3. LINDAT/CLARIN digital library at the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics (UFAL), Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University.

I will compile the extracted datasets along with their citations into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its corresponding citation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for any further processing or review.
