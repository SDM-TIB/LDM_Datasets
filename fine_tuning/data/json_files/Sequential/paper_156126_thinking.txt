To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Public Transit Demand Prediction During Highly Dynamic Conditions: A Meta-Analysis of State-of-the-Art Models and Open-Source Benchmarking Infrastructure" by Juan D. Caicedo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a time series from smartcard data to predict demand for the bus rapid transit system in Bogotá, Colombia. This suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, specifically **section 3.3 (Data)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the dataset encompasses daily transactions of 147 stations over five years (from August 2015 to May 2021) in the Bogotá BRT system. They also highlight two highly dynamic conditions: a month-long protest in November and December 2019 and the COVID-19 pandemic starting in March 2020.

The authors provide a link to the dataset, stating that it is publicly available at: https://datosabiertos-transmilenio.hub.arcgis.com. This is crucial information for the dataset entry.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is publicly available and does not have a formal citation like a journal article, I will note that it is a dataset from the Bogotá BRT system and provide the link as the source.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Bogotá BRT System Demand Dataset
   - **Description**: This dataset contains daily transactions of 147 stations over five years (August 2015 to May 2021) in the Bogotá bus rapid transit system. It includes data during two highly dynamic conditions: a month-long protest and the COVID-19 pandemic.
   - **Link**: [Bogotá BRT System Demand Dataset](https://datosabiertos-transmilenio.hub.arcgis.com)

Since there are no additional datasets mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format for review or downstream processing.

In summary, I have identified the dataset related to the Bogotá BRT system, described its contents, and provided the necessary link for access.
