To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting Long-term Temporal Dynamics for Video Captioning" by Yuyu Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on two public video captioning benchmarks, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Microsoft Video Description Corpus (MSVD)**: This dataset consists of 1,970 short video clips collected from YouTube, with approximately 80,000 descriptions. Each video clip has an average length of about 9 seconds and an average of forty descriptions. The dataset covers a wide range of topics.

2. **MSR Video to Text (MSR-VTT)**: This dataset contains 10,000 video clips and 200,000 descriptions, also collected by Amazon Mechanical Turkers. It is a large-scale open-domain video captioning benchmark that includes diverse visual content across about 20 categories.

I will then verify the details provided in the **experiments section** to confirm that these datasets were indeed used for evaluation. The authors state that they performed experiments on both the MSVD and MSR-VTT datasets, which confirms their relevance.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MSVD**, the citation is:
  > Chen, D., Dolan, W.B. (2011). Collecting highly parallel data for paraphrase evaluation. In: ACL HLT, pp. 190–200.

- For **MSR-VTT**, the citation is:
  > Xu, J., Mei, T., Yao, T., Rui, Y. (2016). MSR-VTT: A large video description dataset for bridging video and language. In: CVPR, pp. 5288–5296.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will prepare the information for any required structured output or further analysis.
