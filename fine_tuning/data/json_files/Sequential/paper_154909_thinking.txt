To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Demand Forecasting in Smart Grid Using Long Short-Term Memory" by Koushik Roy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the model is trained with "hourly energy and power usage data of four years from a smart grid," which suggests that there is a specific dataset being utilized.

Next, I will focus on **section II (System Model)**, where the authors describe the data source. They mention that the dataset includes "electrical generation, consumption, pricing, and weather data collected in the period of 4 years for Spain." This is a crucial detail as it specifies the dataset's scope and origin.

In the **Data Exploration subsection**, the authors provide details about the dataset, including the number of data points and the features included. They mention that the dataset consists of "Total load forecast" and "Total load actual," which are the key components of the dataset used for their analysis.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. The authors refer to a public portal for the Transmission Service Operator (TSO) in Spain as the source of their data. However, they do not provide a formal citation for this dataset in the references, which is common in cases where the data is publicly available.

To summarize the findings:
1. **Dataset Name**: Smart Grid Power Usage Data
   - **Description**: This dataset includes hourly electrical generation, consumption, pricing, and weather data collected over four years in Spain. It specifically focuses on total load forecast and total load actual data.
   - **Source**: Public portal for Transmission Service Operator (TSO) in Spain.

Since there is no formal citation provided for the dataset, I will note that it is important to mention the source as a public portal, but I will also indicate that a specific citation is not available.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
