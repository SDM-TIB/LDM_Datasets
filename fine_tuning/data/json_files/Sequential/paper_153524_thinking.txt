To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MetAdapt: Meta-Learned Task-Adaptive Architecture for Few-Shot Classification" by Sivan Doveh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art results on two popular few-shot benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they state that they used the **miniImageNet** and **FC100** datasets for their experiments. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets.

1. **miniImageNet**: The paper describes miniImageNet as a standard benchmark for few-shot image classification, consisting of 100 classes randomly chosen from ILSVRC-2012, with each class containing 600 images of size 84 × 84. The classes are split into 64 for meta-training, 16 for meta-validation, and 20 for meta-testing.

2. **FC100**: The FC100 dataset is constructed from the CIFAR-100 dataset, containing 100 classes grouped into 20 super-classes. The authors mention that it is partitioned into 60 classes for meta-training, 20 for meta-validation, and 20 for meta-testing, with each class containing 600 images of size 32 × 32.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **miniImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T., Kavukcuoglu, K., & Wierstra, D. (2016). Matching Networks for One Shot Learning. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS).

- For **FC100**, the citation is:
  > Oreshkin, B.N., Rodriguez, P., & Lacoste, A. (2018). TADAM: Task dependent adaptive metric for improved few-shot learning. In NeurIPS.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for any future reference or use.
