To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SCARLET-NAS: Bridging the Gap between Stability and Scalability in Weight-sharing Neural Architecture Search" by Xiangxiang Chu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of neural architecture search but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed.

In **section 5 (Experiments)**, the authors mention using the **ILSVRC2012 dataset** for training and searching. They specify that the validation set consists of 50,000 images selected from the training set, and the original validation set serves as the test set. This is a clear identification of a dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ILSVRC2012 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.J., Li, K., Fei-Fei, L. "ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248–255, 2009.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will prepare to compile this information into the required format.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **ILSVRC2012 Dataset**: Used for training and searching, with a validation set of 50,000 images selected from the training set.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.J., Li, K., Fei-Fei, L. "ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248–255, 2009.

With this information, I am ready to format the dataset entry as needed.
