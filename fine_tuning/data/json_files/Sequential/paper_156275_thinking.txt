To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VulnSense: Efficient Vulnerability Detection in Ethereum Smart Contracts" by Phan The Duy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors assess their framework using a collection of 1,769 smart contracts derived from three datasets. This indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to identify.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the limitations of existing vulnerability detection methods and the need for a comprehensive approach. They mention the datasets used for evaluation, which will help me pinpoint the exact names.

In the **experiments section**, specifically in section 5.3 (Dataset and Preprocessing), the authors explicitly list the three datasets used:

1. **Smartbugs Curated**: This dataset is part of the Smartbugs framework and is used for analyzing smart contracts. It contains various smart contracts with known vulnerabilities.

2. **SolidiFI-Benchmark**: This dataset is designed for benchmarking vulnerability detection tools and includes a collection of smart contracts with different types of vulnerabilities.

3. **Smartbugs Wild**: This dataset consists of smart contracts that contain a single vulnerability, either an Arithmetic vulnerability or a Reentrancy vulnerability, confirmed by at least two vulnerability detection tools.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Smartbugs Curated**, the citation is:
  > T. Durieux, J. F. Ferreira, R. Abreu, P. Cruz. *Empirical review of automated analysis tools on 47,587 ethereum smart contracts*. In Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE 42nd International Conference on Software Engineering, 2020, pp. 530–541.

- For **SolidiFI-Benchmark**, the citation is:
  > A. Ghaleb, K. Pattabiraman. *How effective are smart contract analysis tools? Evaluating smart contract static analysis tools using bug injection*. In Proceedings of the 29th ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis, 2021.

- For **Smartbugs Wild**, the citation is:
  > J. F. Ferreira, P. Cruz, T. Durieux, R. Abreu. *Smartbugs: A framework to analyze solidity smart contracts*. In Proceedings of the 35th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, 2020, pp. 1349–1352.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring they are structured and ready for further processing or review.
