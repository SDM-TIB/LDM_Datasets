To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bitcoin Transaction Strategy Construction Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Fengrui Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a framework for high-frequency bitcoin transactions and mentions empirical studies, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In **section 4.1 (Data Preparation)**, the authors state that the dataset comes from the website cryptodatadownload and includes 30,984 valid records covering the period from August 17, 2017, to February 27, 2021. This is a crucial piece of information.

I will also check the **references** section to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the source of their dataset as follows:

- For the dataset from cryptodatadownload, the citation is:
  > "Cryptodatadownload. Available at: https://www.cryptodatadownload.com/"

Since this is a website and not a traditional dataset citation, I will ensure to note it as the source of the data used in their experiments.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Bitcoin Price Dataset**: This dataset consists of 30,984 valid records of bitcoin prices, covering the period from August 17, 2017, to February 27, 2021. It is used for training and testing the proposed trading strategy.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset source. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
