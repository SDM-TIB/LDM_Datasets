To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Danish Stance Classification and Rumour Resolution" by Anders E. Lillie and Emil R. Middelboe, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the creation of a "stance-annotated Reddit dataset for the Danish language," which indicates that a dataset is indeed present. I will note this dataset and look for more details in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Danish stance-annotated Reddit dataset)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the dataset. Here, I will look for specifics such as the dataset's name, the number of posts, the method of data collection, and any relevant statistics or annotations.

In section 5.1, the authors describe the data gathering process, indicating that the dataset contains **3,007 Reddit posts** distributed across **33 submissions** related to **16 events**. This section also mentions that the dataset is publicly available, which is important for citation purposes.

I will also check **section 5.2 (Annotation)** for details on how the dataset was annotated. The authors mention using the SDQC (Supporting, Denying, Querying, Commenting) annotation scheme, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and usability.

After gathering the necessary information about the dataset, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors cite their dataset as follows:

- Lillie, A. E., & Middelboe, E. R. (2019). Danish stance-annotated Reddit dataset. doi: 10.6084/m9.figshare.8217137.v1.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset's name, description, and full citation.

The dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **Danish stance-annotated Reddit dataset**: A dataset containing 3,007 Reddit posts annotated for stance classification in the Danish language, publicly available for research purposes.

The full citation for the dataset is:
- Lillie, A. E., & Middelboe, E. R. (2019). Danish stance-annotated Reddit dataset. doi: 10.6084/m9.figshare.8217137.v1.

This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant details about the dataset for future reference or analysis.
