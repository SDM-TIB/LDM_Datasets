To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SM-NAS: Structural-to-Modular Neural Architecture Search for Object Detection" by Lewei Yao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method demonstrates effectiveness on multiple detection datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors discuss their methodology and results. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets used for evaluation:

1. **COCO Dataset**: This dataset is widely used for object detection tasks and is referenced multiple times throughout the paper. It contains 80 object classes and a total of 118K images for training.

2. **Pascal VOC Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of the proposed method. It consists of 20 object classes and is commonly used in object detection research.

3. **BDD Dataset (Berkeley Deep Drive)**: This dataset is specifically noted for its application in autonomous driving scenarios, containing 10 object classes and approximately 70K images for training.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **COCO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In ECCV, 2014.

- For the **Pascal VOC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Everingham, L. Van Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. IJCV, 88(2):303–338, 2010.

- For the **BDD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Fisher Yu, Wenqi Xian, Yingying Chen, Fangchen Liu, Mike Liao, Vashisht Madhavan, and Trevor Darrell. *BDD100K: A diverse driving video database with scalable annotation tooling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.04687, 2018.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
