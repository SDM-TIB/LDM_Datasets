To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DroneVis: Versatile Computer Vision Library for Drones" by Ahmed Heakl et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the library and its capabilities, but I need to look for specific datasets used in experiments or model training.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and tasks sections** where the authors discuss various computer vision tasks and the models used. In these sections, they often mention datasets used for training or evaluation. For instance, I will look for any references to datasets in the context of tasks like object detection, action recognition, or pose estimation.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention several datasets:

1. **COCO Dataset**: This dataset is referenced multiple times in relation to various models, including YOLOv8 and Faster R-CNN. It is widely used for object detection and segmentation tasks.

2. **Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of face detection models, particularly for evaluating the performance of the MediaPipe Face Classifier and other face detection algorithms.

3. **UCF101 Dataset**: This dataset is referenced for action recognition tasks, specifically in the context of evaluating the performance of the action recognition models discussed in the paper.

4. **KITTI Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in relation to depth estimation tasks, where the authors evaluate their model's performance.

5. **BDD100k Dataset**: This dataset is referenced for road segmentation and lane detection tasks, particularly in the context of the YOLOP model.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

The full citations I find are:

- **COCO Dataset**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant datasets are accurately represented and properly cited.
