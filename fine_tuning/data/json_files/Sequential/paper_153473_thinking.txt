To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long-range Prediction of Vital Signs Using Generative Boosting via LSTM Networks" by Shiyu Liu and Mehul Motani, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the prediction of vital signs, which suggests that there may be a dataset involved, but I need to find specific details.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Performance Evaluation)**, where the authors describe the dataset used in their experiments. Here, they mention that the dataset contains information from **177 medical patients** and includes various features such as age, gender, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood oxygen saturation, body temperature, and systolic blood pressure. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's composition and the context in which it was used.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, in this case, the dataset is derived from a local hospital and does not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note that the dataset is based on patient data collected with ethical approval from the local institutional ethics committee.

Since the dataset is not a standard public dataset, I will summarize the dataset description as follows:

1. **Patient Vital Signs Dataset**: This dataset includes data from 177 medical patients, containing demographic and medical information recorded by a wearable system that continuously monitors vital signs. The features include age, gender, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood oxygen saturation, body temperature, and systolic blood pressure. The data is collected at regular intervals of 5 minutes over a duration of 24 hours.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly indicate the nature of the dataset and its source, even if it does not have a formal citation.

In summary, I will document the dataset as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Patient Vital Signs Dataset
- **Description**: Contains data from 177 medical patients, including demographic and medical information recorded by a wearable system. Features include age, gender, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood oxygen saturation, body temperature, and systolic blood pressure, collected at 5-minute intervals over 24 hours.
- **Citation**: No formal citation available; data collected with ethical approval from a local institutional ethics committee.

This approach ensures that I accurately capture the dataset's details and provide the necessary context for its use in the research.
