To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compound Density Networks for Risk Prediction using Electronic Health Records" by Yuxi Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their model on the **MIMIC-III dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section III) where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly state that they conduct mortality prediction experiments on the **MIMIC-III dataset**. They describe it as one of the largest publicly available ICU datasets, comprising 38,597 distinct patients and a total of 53,423 ICU stays. This section provides essential details about the dataset's scope and relevance.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MIMIC-III dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> A. E. Johnson, T. J. Pollard, L. Shen, H. L. Li-Wei, M. Feng, M. Ghassemi, B. Moody, P. Szolovits, L. A. Celi, and R. G. Mark. *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific data, vol. 3, no. 1, pp. 1â€“9, 2016.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the MIMIC-III dataset for its experiments, I will ensure that this dataset is thoroughly documented.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that the dataset entry includes the name, description, and full citation as required.

In summary, the key steps I will take are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify the dataset.
2. Review the experiments section for detailed information about the dataset.
3. Locate the full citation in the references section.
4. Document the dataset with all necessary details.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the dataset used in the research paper.
