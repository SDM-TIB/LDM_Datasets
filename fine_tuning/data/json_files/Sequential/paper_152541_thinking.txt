To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Reprogramming of Text Classification Neural Networks" by Paarth Neekhara et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as it is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors explicitly list the datasets they employed for their adversarial reprogramming experiments. I will look for a subsection that discusses the datasets, which is typically labeled as "Datasets" or something similar.

Upon examining section 4.1, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Surname Classiﬁcation Dataset (Names-18, Names-5)**: This dataset categorizes surnames from 18 languages of origin, with a subset (Names-5) used for the experiments. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Sean Robertson. *Classifying character-level names with pytorch rnn tutorial*. 2017. Available at: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/char_rnn_classification_tutorial.html.

2. **Experimental Data for Question Classification (Questions)**: This dataset categorizes around 5500 questions into 6 classes. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Xin Li and Dan Roth. *Learning question classifiers*. In Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Computational Linguistics - Volume 1, COLING ’02, Stroudsburg, PA, USA. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2002.

3. **Sentiment Classification Dataset (Arabic)**: This dataset contains 2000 binary labeled tweets on diverse topics. The citation for this dataset is:
   > N. A. Abdulla, N. A. Ahmed, M. A. Shehab, and M. Al-Ayyoub. *Arabic sentiment analysis: Lexicon-based and corpus-based*. In 2013 IEEE Jordan Conference on Applied Electrical Engineering and Computing Technologies (AEECT), 2013.

4. **Large Movie Review Dataset (IMDB)**: This dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews categorized into binary classes of positive and negative sentiment. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Portland, Oregon, USA, 2011.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I accurately compile this information in a structured format for further use or analysis.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for any downstream processing or review.
