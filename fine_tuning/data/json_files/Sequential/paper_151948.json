The real data is recorded speech spoken by actual talkers in four real noisy environments (on buses, in caf√©s, in pedestrian areas, and at street junctions). The training set consists of 1600 real noisy utterances from 4 speakers, and 7138 simulated noisy utterances from the 83 speakers in the WSJ0 SI-84 training set recorded in 4 noisy environments. There are 3280 utterances in the development set including 410 real and 410 simulated utterances for each of the 4 environments. There are 2640 utterances in the test set including 330 real and 330 simulated utterances for each of the 4 environments.",
