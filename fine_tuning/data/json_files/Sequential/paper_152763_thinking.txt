To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Visual Rhythm Prediction with Feature-Aligning Network" by Yutong Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a dataset based on professionally edited music videos (MVs) due to the lack of existing public datasets. This suggests that a new dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiment)**, where the authors provide details about the dataset they constructed. They mention that they created the **MV Visual Rhythm (MVVR) dataset** based on YouTube music videos and professionally edited MVs from a popular music website, YinYueTai. They describe the dataset's size and the process of filtering out poorly edited MVs, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's quality and relevance.

The authors provide specific details about the dataset:
- The MVVR dataset consists of 800 video segments.
- The total number of frames is 850,620, with 318,932 labeled as onsets and 531,688 as non-onsets.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the sources they used to construct their dataset. However, the authors do not provide a formal citation for the MVVR dataset itself, as it is a new dataset they created. Instead, they reference the sources from which they obtained the music videos:
1. **YouTube-music-video-5M**: This is a collection of various styles of music videos. The citation is:
   > Keunwoo Choi, et al. *YouTube-music-video-5M*. GitHub repository, https://github.com/keunwoochoi/YouTube-music-video-5M.

2. **YinYueTai**: A popular music website where they sourced professionally edited MVs. The citation is:
   > YinYueTai. *YinYueTai Music Videos*. http://www.yinyuetai.com/.

Since the MVVR dataset is constructed by the authors and does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is an original dataset created for this research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the sources used to create the MVVR dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset utilized in the research.
