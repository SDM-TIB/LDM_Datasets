To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Representing ELMo embeddings as two-dimensional text online" by Andrey Kutuzov and Elizaveta Kuzmenko, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the addition of a new module to the WebVectors toolkit that supports ELMo models, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, it does indicate that the system is integrated with pre-trained ELMo models for Russian, Norwegian, and English, which suggests that these models may be based on specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **background** section, where the authors discuss the WebVectors framework and its purpose. They mention that the framework allows for the demonstration of static distributional word representations and contextualized embeddings. However, there is no direct mention of specific datasets here either.

I will then look into the **system description** section, where the authors describe the requirements for deploying the ELMo models. They list three data sources needed for each ELMo model, including a pre-trained ELMo model, a frequency dictionary file, and a set of static word embeddings. While this provides insight into the components needed for the models, it still does not specify any datasets.

In the **conclusion** section, the authors mention that the ELMo models are trained on English Wikipedia and Norwegian corpora, as well as a concatenated Russian Wikipedia and Russian National Corpus. This is crucial information as it identifies the datasets used for training the ELMo models.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets based on the information provided in the paper:

1. **English Wikipedia**: The citation for the dataset is not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is widely recognized as a publicly available dataset. A general citation could be:
   > "English Wikipedia. Available at: https://en.wikipedia.org"

2. **Norwegian Corpora**: The paper does not provide a specific citation for the Norwegian corpora, but it is likely part of the Nordic Language Processing Laboratory initiative. A general citation could be:
   > "Norwegian Corpora. Available at: https://www.nb.no"

3. **Russian Wikipedia**: Similar to the English Wikipedia, the citation is not explicitly provided, but it can be cited as:
   > "Russian Wikipedia. Available at: https://ru.wikipedia.org"

4. **Russian National Corpus**: The citation for this dataset is also not provided in the paper, but it can be cited as:
   > "Russian National Corpus. Available at: http://www.ruscorpora.ru"

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations. I will then prepare to format this information according to the required structure for further processing or review.
