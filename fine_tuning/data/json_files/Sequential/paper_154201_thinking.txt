To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transfer Learning from Monolingual ASR to Transcription-free Cross-lingual Voice Conversion" by Che-Jui Chang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the experiments were conducted on **Voice Conversion Challenge 2020 datasets**, which suggests that this is a key dataset to note.

Next, I will look for specific details about the datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the author describes the Voice Conversion Challenge 2020 (VCC 2020) datasets, which include recordings from **8 English, 2 Finnish, 2 German, and 2 Mandarin speakers**, with each speaker providing **70 utterances** recorded at **24kHz**. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's composition and purpose.

I will also check the **methodology section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or referenced. The author discusses training on the **LibriSpeech** dataset for the monolingual acoustic model, which is another dataset that needs to be included.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. For the **Voice Conversion Challenge 2020 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Y. Zhao, W.C. Huang, X. Tian, J. Yamagishi, R.K. Das, T. Kinnunen, Z. King, and T. Toda. *Voice Conversion Challenge 2020 â€“ Intra-lingual semi-parallel and cross-lingual voice conversion*. ISCA Joint Workshop for the Blizzard Challenge and Voice Conversion Challenge 2020, ISCA, 2020.

2. For the **LibriSpeech dataset**, the citation is:
   > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *Librispeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP, 2015, pp. 5206-5210.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Voice Conversion Challenge 2020 dataset**: A dataset consisting of recordings from multiple speakers across different languages, specifically designed for voice conversion tasks.
- **LibriSpeech dataset**: A large corpus of English speech derived from audiobooks, used for training acoustic models in speech recognition tasks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
