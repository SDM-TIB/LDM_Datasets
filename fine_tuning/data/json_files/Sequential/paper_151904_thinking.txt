To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Siamese Neural Networks with Random Forest for detecting duplicate question pairs" by Ameya Godbole et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a dataset released by Quora, which consists of about 400k labeled question pairs. This is a strong indication that I need to gather more details about this dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of detecting duplicate questions and mention the Quora dataset again. This reinforces the importance of this dataset in their research.

In the **experiments section**, specifically in **section 4.1 (Dataset Preprocessing)**, the authors describe the dataset preprocessing steps and mention that they used the Quora Question Pairs dataset. They also provide details about how they augmented the dataset, which is crucial for understanding its application in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the Quora Question Pairs dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the dataset in the text, but I can refer to the original source of the dataset, which is hosted on Kaggle.

The citation for the Quora Question Pairs dataset is:
> Quora. *Quora Question Pairs Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs/data.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
