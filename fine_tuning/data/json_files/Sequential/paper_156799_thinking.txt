To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ReactAIvate: A Deep Learning Approach to Predicting Reaction Mechanisms and Unmasking Reactivity Hotspots" by Ajnabiul Hoque et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors created a comprehensive dataset with seven distinct classes representing elementary steps in chemical reaction mechanisms. This suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset details)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset they curated. They mention that the dataset consists of three different families of catalytic reactions, comprising seven distinct elementary mechanistic steps. This section is crucial as it provides specific details about the dataset.

The authors also mention that they created essential reaction templates for each elementary mechanistic step within the three considered reaction datasets. This indicates that the dataset is not only comprehensive but also structured around specific chemical reactions.

In **section 4.1**, they state that the dataset encompasses a total of 100,000 elementary mechanistic steps. This is a significant detail that confirms the dataset's size and scope.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to three specific reaction classes: 

1. **Suzuki-Miyaura coupling (SMC)**:
   - Citation: 
     > R. Martin and S. L. Buchwald. *Palladium-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions employing dialkylbiarylphosphine ligands*. Accounts of Chemical Research, 41(11):1461–1473, 2008.

2. **Buchwald-Hartwig amination (BHA)**:
   - Citation:
     > N. Miyaura and S. L. Buchwald. *Palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions of organoboron compounds*. Chemical Reviews, 95(7):2457–2483, 1995.

3. **Kumada coupling (KC)**:
   - Citation:
     > P. Ruiz-Castillo and S. L. Buchwald. *Applications of palladium-catalyzed C–N cross-coupling reactions*. Chemical Reviews, 116(19):12564–12649, 2016.

These citations provide the necessary references for the datasets related to the specific reaction mechanisms discussed in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant information is accurately captured for further processing or review.
