To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bidirectional Attentional Encoder-Decoder Model and Bidirectional Beam Search for Abstractive Summarization" by Kamal Al-Sabahi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the experimental results were evaluated on the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for more details in the **experiments section**. Here, the authors explicitly mention that they used the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset** for evaluation. They provide additional context about the dataset, including its origin and structure. They note that it was originally built by Hermann et al. (2015) for a question-answering task and has been reused for various summarization tasks. The dataset consists of 286,726 training examples, 13,368 validation examples, and 11,490 testing examples, with specific statistics about the source documents and summaries.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset**. The relevant citation is:

- Hermann, K.M.; Kocisk√Ω, T.; Grefenstette, E.; Espeholt, L.; Kay, W.; Suleyman, M.; and Blunsom, P. (2015). *Teaching Machines to Read and Comprehend*. CoRR abs/1506.03340.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entry for the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset** and ensure it is ready for further processing or review.
