To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Calcium imaging and analysis of the mouse hippocampus or neocortex using miniature microendoscopes" by Jessica Winne et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the study and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract discusses the use of miniature microendoscopes for calcium imaging, which suggests that there may be datasets related to calcium imaging techniques or results.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods** and **results** sections. These sections often contain detailed descriptions of the experimental setup and the data collected. I will pay close attention to any references to specific datasets, including their names, sizes, and the types of data they contain.

In the **methods section**, the authors describe the use of genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) and various imaging techniques. I will note any specific datasets mentioned in relation to these techniques. For example, if they reference a dataset containing calcium imaging data from specific experiments, I will extract that information.

I will also check the **results section** for any analysis or findings that reference datasets. If the authors present results based on specific datasets, I will document those datasets, including any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of measurements, and experimental conditions.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a specific calcium imaging dataset, I will look for the original source of that dataset in the references. I will ensure to include the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for presentation or further processing, ensuring clarity and accuracy in the documentation of each dataset.
