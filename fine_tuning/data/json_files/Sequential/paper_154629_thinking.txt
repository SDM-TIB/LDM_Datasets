To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Forget the Forget Gate: Estimating Anomalies in Videos using Self-contained Long Short-Term Memory Networks" by Habtamu Fanta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenges of abnormal event detection and the importance of large annotated datasets. This suggests that datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **CUHK Avenue**: This dataset consists of videos captured at the Avenue of Chinese University of Hong Kong, containing 16 training and 21 test videos, with a total of 15,328 frames for training and 15,324 frames for testing. The resolution of the videos is 640 x 360 pixels, and it includes various abnormal events like loitering and throwing objects.

2. **UCSD Ped1**: This dataset includes video recordings from a pedestrian walkway, comprising 34 training and 36 test videos, with frames split into a resolution of 238 x 158 pixels. The test set contains annotations for various abnormal events.

3. **UCSD Ped2**: Similar to Ped1, this dataset consists of 16 training and 12 test videos, with varying frame counts and a resolution of 360 x 240 pixels. It also includes annotations for abnormal events like the presence of vehicles and unusual pedestrian behavior.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **CUHK Avenue**:
  > C. Lu, J. Shi, and J. Jia. *Abnormal event detection at 150 fps in matlab*. In International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2720–2727. IEEE, 2013.

- For **UCSD Ped1** and **UCSD Ped2**:
  > W. Li, V. Mahadevan, and N. Vasconcelos. *Anomaly detection and localization in crowded scenes*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), 36(1):18–32, 2014.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for further processing or review.
