To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Snail Homing and Mating Search Algorithm: A Novel Bio-Inspired Metaheuristic Algorithm" by Anand J Kulkarni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed algorithm and its applications, which may hint at the datasets used for validation.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors typically describe the experiments conducted. This section may detail the datasets used for testing the Snail Homing and Mating Search (SHMS) algorithm. I will look for any specific names of datasets or references to benchmark problems.

In the **results section**, the authors often compare their algorithm's performance against existing methods using specific datasets. This section may provide additional context or confirmation of the datasets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or referenced by others.

For example, if the paper mentions benchmark functions or datasets like "Sphere function" or "Rastrigin function," I will look for their original sources or papers that describe these datasets in detail.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
