To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative adversarial network (GAN) and enhanced root mean square error (ERMSE): deep learning for stock price movement prediction" by Ashish Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on stock price movement prediction, which suggests that datasets related to stock prices are likely involved.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** to find specific details about the datasets used. In the results section, the authors mention using a stock index dataset of various companies from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2018. This indicates that the dataset is time-series data related to stock prices.

I will also look for any specific references to the source of the dataset. The paper states that the dataset was obtained from Yahoo Finance (finance.yahoo.com) and is available as a CSV file. This is crucial information for citing the dataset properly.

Now, I will compile the details of the dataset:

1. **Stock Index Dataset**: This dataset includes historical stock price data (open, low, high, close, and volume) for various companies over the specified time period.

Next, I will gather the full citation for the dataset source:

- For the **Yahoo Finance dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yahoo Finance. *Yahoo Finance Stock Data*. Available at: https://finance.yahoo.com/ (Accessed: [insert access date]).

Finally, I will ensure that I have all the necessary details to create structured entries for each dataset, including the dataset name, description, and citation. This will allow me to present the information clearly and accurately for any further processing or review.
