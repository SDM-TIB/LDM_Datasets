To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revisiting the dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates in a double well by deep learning with a hybrid network" by Shurui Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets or data generation methods.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe their experiments and data generation processes. In this paper, the authors mention using the **Runge-Kutta method** to generate training data for the dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). They specify that they generated a dataset consisting of two-dimensional data for the fractional population difference \( z(t) \) and phase dynamics \( \phi(t) \) over a range of parameters.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail the parameters used for generating the datasets, including the range of \( \Lambda \) values and the number of samples. They state that they uniformly separated 90,001 \( \Lambda \) values within the range of [5.6, 14.6] and solved for \( z(t) \) and \( \phi(t) \) for each \( \Lambda \) using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. This indicates that the datasets are derived from numerical simulations rather than being pre-existing datasets.

Now, I will compile the relevant datasets and their citations. The paper does not reference any external datasets but instead describes the generation of its own datasets. Therefore, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the datasets.

The datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Dataset for \( z(t) \) and \( \phi(t) \)**: This dataset consists of 90,001 samples of the fractional population difference \( z(t) \) and phase dynamics \( \phi(t) \) generated using the Runge-Kutta method over the parameter range \( \Lambda \in [5.6, 14.6] \).

The citation for this dataset is:

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
