To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Foundational GPT Model for MEG" by Richard Csaky et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "large amounts of unlabelled data" for training models, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the application of their models to "brain signals, such as Magneto-/electroencephalography (M/EEG)," but do not specify datasets yet. I will continue to the methods section.

In the **methods section**, the authors describe their dataset of choice as the "continuous 15-subject, 118-image data from Cichy et al. (2016)." This is a clear identification of a dataset used in their experiments. I will note down the details of this dataset.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Cichy et al. dataset. The relevant citation is:
> Cichy, R. M., Khosla, A., Pantazis, D., Torralba, A., & Oliva, A. (2016). Comparison of deep neural networks to spatio-temporal cortical dynamics of human visual object recognition reveals hierarchical correspondence. *Scientific Reports*, 6(1), 1-13.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the results or discussion sections. The authors refer to their models being evaluated on "task data," but they do not specify additional datasets beyond the Cichy dataset.

After reviewing the entire paper, I conclude that the only dataset explicitly mentioned is the Cichy et al. dataset. I will now compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **Cichy et al. (2016) dataset**: Continuous 15-subject, 118-image data used for evaluating the models.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for further processing.
