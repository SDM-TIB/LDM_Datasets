To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differentiable Dynamic Programming for Structured Prediction and Attention" by Arthur Mensch and Mathieu Blondel, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

1. **Initial Reading**: I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the datasets used in the experiments, while the introduction may elaborate on their significance.

2. **Identifying Sections**: Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 4 (Experiments)** or any section explicitly labeled as **Datasets**. These sections often provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study.

3. **Extracting Dataset Information**: In the relevant sections, I will look for:
   - The names of the datasets.
   - Descriptions of the datasets, including their size, type, and any specific characteristics (e.g., number of samples, types of annotations).
   - Any mentions of how the datasets were used in the experiments.

4. **Cross-Referencing**: If the datasets are mentioned, I will cross-reference them with the **References section** to find the full citations. This is crucial for ensuring that I have the correct and complete citation for each dataset.

5. **Full Citations**: For each dataset identified, I will note down the full citation as it appears in the references. This may include the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

6. **Compiling the Information**: After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile it into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:
   - The name of the dataset.
   - A brief description of the dataset.
   - The full citation.

7. **Review**: Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset entries.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract the datasets from the paper effectively while ensuring that I provide the necessary citations for each dataset.
