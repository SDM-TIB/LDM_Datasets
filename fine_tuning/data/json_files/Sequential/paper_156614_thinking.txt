To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging the Interplay Between Syntactic and Acoustic Cues for Optimizing Korean TTS Pause Formation" by Yejin Jeon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of applying TTS models to the Korean language and hints at the use of datasets for training and evaluation. 

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** and **experimental results** sections. In the methodology, the authors mention using the **KSS dataset**, which is a key dataset for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its characteristics and relevance to the study.

In the **experimental results** section, I will confirm the use of the KSS dataset and any other datasets that may be referenced. The authors discuss their training setup and mention that the KSS dataset consists of 22050 Hz audio files, which are on average 2.38 seconds long. This information is crucial for describing the dataset.

After gathering information about the datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. The KSS dataset is cited as follows:

- **KSS Dataset**: 
  > Kyubyong Park. 2018. KSS Dataset: Korean Single Speaker Speech Dataset. Available at: https://kaggle.com/bryanpark/korean-single-speaker-speech-dataset.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the KSS dataset, I will ensure that I accurately represent this dataset in my final output.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all details are clear and precise for future reference or analysis.
