To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Closing the Dequantization Gap: PixelCNN as a Single-Layer Flow" by Didrik Nielsen and Ole Winther, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used for experiments. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for their experiments. I will look for specific details about this dataset, such as its size, content, and any relevant characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors state: "We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10 for flow models trained with dequantization." This confirms that CIFAR-10 is a primary dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset is:

- **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: 
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset of images*. 2009. Available at: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude my extraction here.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for CIFAR-10, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will allow for proper referencing in any subsequent analysis or documentation.
