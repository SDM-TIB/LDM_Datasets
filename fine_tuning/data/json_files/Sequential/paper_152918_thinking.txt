To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identifying cross country skiing techniques using power meters in ski poles" by Moa Johansson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a pilot study using data from Skisens poles to identify skiing techniques, indicating that a dataset is involved. 

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (The Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset used in their experiments. They mention that the dataset was provided by Skisens AB and consists of data from three individual skiers using the Skisens ski pole handles. The dataset includes labeled time-series data for different skiing techniques (double poling and gears 2-4) recorded under varied conditions.

The authors specify that the dataset contains **1671 individual strokes**, with a breakdown of strokes for each technique:
- 252 strokes in Gear 2
- 473 strokes in Gear 3
- 360 strokes in Gear 4
- 585 strokes using double poling

This detailed breakdown confirms the presence of a structured dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The dataset is attributed to Skisens AB, but since it is not a traditional academic dataset with a specific publication, I will note it as follows:

- **Dataset Citation**:
  > Skisens AB. *Dataset for identifying cross country skiing techniques using power meters in ski poles*. Unpublished dataset.

Since the dataset is not published in a conventional manner, I will ensure to mention it as an unpublished dataset in the citation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
