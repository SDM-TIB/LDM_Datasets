To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Speaker-independent neural formant synthesis" by Pablo Pérez Zarazaga et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of phonetically meaningful speech parameters for speech synthesis, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation)**, where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention that they trained and evaluated their models on data from the **VCTK corpus**. This is a significant dataset for speech synthesis, and I will need to gather more details about it.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors state that the VCTK corpus contains 44,000 utterances from 110 English speakers with various accents. This information is crucial for describing the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the VCTK corpus. The citation provided in the paper is:

> J. Yamagishi, C. Veaux, K. MacDonald et al., “CSTR VCTK corpus: English multi-speaker corpus for CSTR voice cloning toolkit (version 0.92),” University of Edinburgh. The Centre for Speech Technology Research (CSTR), 2019.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's name, description, and citation, ready for any further processing or review.
