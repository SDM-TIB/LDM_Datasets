To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AutoSUM: Automating Feature Extraction and Multi-user Preference Simulation for Entity Summarization" by Dongjun Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on two widely used datasets, specifically **DBpedia** and **LinkedMDB**. This is a strong indication that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In this section, they mention the **ESBM dataset v1.1**, which consists of 6.8k triples related to 125 entities from DBpedia and 2.6k triples related to 50 entities from LinkedMDB. This section confirms the datasets used for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **DBpedia**, the citation is:
  > Bizer, C., Lehmann, J., Kobilarov, G., Auer, S., Becker, C., Cyganiak, R., Hellmann, S. (2009). *DBpedia - A Crystallization Point for the Web of Data*. Journal of Web Semantics, 7(3), 154-165.

- For **LinkedMDB**, the citation is:
  > Consens, M.P. (2008). *Managing Linked Data on the Web: The LinkedMDB Showcase*. In Proceedings of the 2008 Latin American Web Conference, 1-2.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be described with its name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for proper referencing.
