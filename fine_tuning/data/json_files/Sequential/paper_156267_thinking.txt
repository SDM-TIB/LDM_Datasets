To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SAGE: Structured Attribute Value Generation for Billion-Scale Product Catalogs" by Athanasios N. Nikolakopoulos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

In the **experimental section (Section 3)**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They refer to a dataset called **BPD**, which is described as containing public data for millions of products across thousands of Product-Type-Attribute-Country (PAC) scopes. This dataset is crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Additionally, the authors mention a **random subset of BPD**, referred to as **BPD[500]**, which is used for ablation studies. This subset contains 500 randomly selected PACs and is significant for evaluating the model's performance.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets directly, as they are likely proprietary or internal datasets used by the authors. However, I will note the context in which they are mentioned.

1. **BPD Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing public data for millions of products and is essential for training and evaluating the SAGE model. The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, as it appears to be an internal dataset.

2. **BPD[500] Dataset**: This is a random subset of the BPD dataset, containing 500 PACs used for ablation studies. Similar to BPD, there is no specific citation provided.

Since the datasets are not publicly available or cited in a traditional manner, I will document them as internal datasets used by the authors without formal citations.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly indicate the nature of the datasets and their significance in the research.
