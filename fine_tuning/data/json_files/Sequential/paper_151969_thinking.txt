To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Glimpse LSTM with Color-Depth Feature Fusion for Human Detection" by Hengduo Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves superior performance on two publicly available datasets, indicating that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Kinect Office Dataset**: This dataset contains 17 video sequences captured in an office setting, featuring various human poses such as sitting, standing, and walking.

2. **Kinect Mobile Dataset**: This dataset consists of 18 video sequences collected by a Kinect mounted on a PR2 robot, which was moving inside a building. It includes challenges like illumination variations and complex backgrounds.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the datasets with a citation number [3], which corresponds to the following:

- For the **Kinect Office Dataset**, the citation is:
  > W. Choi, C. Pantofaru, and S. Savarese. "A general framework for tracking multiple people from a moving camera." IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell., vol. 35, pp. 1577â€“1591, 2013.

- For the **Kinect Mobile Dataset**, the same citation is used as it is referenced in the context of the Kinect datasets.

Having gathered this information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will involve summarizing the key details of each dataset, including their names, descriptions, and citations, in a clear and organized manner.
