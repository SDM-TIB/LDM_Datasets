To extract datasets from the research paper titled "High Order Recurrent Neural Networks for Acoustic Modelling" by C. Zhang and P. C. Woodland, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted speech recognition experiments using **British English multi-genre broadcast (MGB3)** data. This indicates that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experimental setup** section. In the **experimental setup** (Section 4), the authors describe their training systems using **MGB data from the MGB3 speech recognition challenge task**. They specify that the audio is from BBC TV programs covering various genres, and they mention the size of the training set (275 hours) and the test set (5.55 hours of audio data).

Now, I will gather the full citation for the MGB3 dataset. The authors thank Mark Gales and the MGB3 team for the MGB3 setup used, which suggests that the dataset is well-documented and likely has a formal citation. I will check the **references section** for any mention of the MGB3 dataset.

Upon reviewing the references, I find the following citation for the MGB challenge:
> P. Bell, M.J.F. Gales, T. Hain, J. Kilgour, P. Lanchantin, X. Liu, A. McParland, S. Renals, O. Saz, M. Wester, & P.C. Woodland. "The MGB challenge: Evaluating multi-genre broadcast media transcription". In Proceedings of the ASRU, Scottsdale, 2015.

This citation provides the necessary details about the dataset used in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. The dataset extracted from this paper is:

1. **MGB3 Dataset**: A dataset used for speech recognition experiments, consisting of audio from BBC TV programs covering a range of genres, with a total of 275 hours of training data and a test set containing 5.55 hours of audio data.

Now, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for further processing.
