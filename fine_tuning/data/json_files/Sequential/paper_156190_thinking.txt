To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging arbitrary mobile sensor trajectories with shallow recurrent decoder networks for full-state reconstruction" by Megan R. Ebers et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method on three applications, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **applications section** where the authors describe the three datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Forced Isotropic Turbulent Flow**: This dataset is sourced from the Johns Hopkins turbulence database and includes data generated via a pseudo-spectral method with 10243 nodes. The authors provide specific details about the number of snapshots and the temporal spacing used for training.

2. **Sea-Surface Temperature (SST)**: This dataset is reported by NOAA and includes weekly mean sea-surface temperature data from 1992 to 2019. The authors detail the grid size and the number of spatial locations, as well as how the data is partitioned for training and validation.

3. **Human Biomechanics**: This dataset captures kinematics from 12 nondisabled adults during walking, recorded using a 10-camera optical motion capture system. The authors provide demographic details about the participants and the methodology used for data collection.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Forced Isotropic Turbulent Flow**, the citation is:
  > Y. Li, E. Perlman, M. Wan, Y. Yang, C. Meneveau, R. Burns, S. Chen, A. Szalay, and G. Eyink. *Journal of Turbulence*, 9, N31, 2008. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1080/14685240802376389.

- For the **Sea-Surface Temperature (SST)** dataset, the citation is:
  > R. W. Reynolds, N. A. Rayner, T. M. Smith, D. C. Stokes, and W. Wang. *Journal of Climate*, 15, 1609, 2002.

- For the **Human Biomechanics** dataset, the citation is:
  > M. C. Rosenberg, B. S. Banjanin, S. A. Burden, and K. M. Steele. *Journal of the Royal Society Interface*, 17, 20200487, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that each dataset is accurately documented with its full citation, which is crucial for academic integrity and reproducibility.
