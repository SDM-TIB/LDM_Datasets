To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Model for Translation of Text from Indian Languages to Bharti Braille Characters" by Nisheeth Joshi and Pragya Katyayan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and proposed system sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the development of a translation system but does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction provides context about the need for Braille text and the challenges faced, which may hint at the types of data used.

Next, I will focus on the **proposed system section**, where the authors describe their methodology. They mention that they created rules for mapping Indian language characters into Bharti Braille characters and list the languages covered, which include Hindi, Marathi, Nepali, Bengali, Assamese, Gujarati, Punjabi, Odia, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, and Urdu. However, there is no explicit mention of a dataset used for training or testing.

I will also examine the **evaluation section** to see if any datasets were used for testing the system. The authors mention testing their system on 1000 sentences for each Indian language, but they do not provide specific details about the source of these sentences or if they constitute a formal dataset.

Since the paper does not provide explicit datasets or their citations, I will look into the **references section** to see if any of the cited works include datasets that could be relevant. However, the references primarily discuss various methodologies and technologies related to Braille translation rather than specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that while the authors describe their approach and the languages involved, they do not provide specific datasets or their citations. Therefore, I will note that no formal datasets were extracted from this paper, as the authors did not reference any specific datasets used in their experiments.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings, indicating that while the paper discusses a translation system for Indian languages to Bharti Braille, it does not explicitly mention or provide citations for any datasets used in the research.
