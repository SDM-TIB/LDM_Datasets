To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ASI++: Towards Distributionally Balanced End-to-End Generative Retrieval" by Yuxuan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on both public and industrial datasets," which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **MS MARCO**: This dataset is described as a large-scale collection of queries and web pages for machine reading comprehension. The authors state that they adopt the official split of the dataset for their experiments.

2. **ADS**: This dataset is noted as a real-world dataset from Bing's sponsored search, consisting of query-ad pairs. The authors provide details about the dataset's structure and how it is utilized in their experiments.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MS MARCO**, the citation is:
  > Tri Nguyen, Mir Rosenberg, Xia Song, Jianfeng Gao, Saurabh Tiwary, Rangan Majumder, and Li Deng. *MS MARCO: A human-generated machine reading comprehension dataset*. 2016.

- For **ADS**, the citation is:
  > Tianchi Yang, Minghui Song, Zihan Zhang, Haizhen Huang, Weiwei Deng, Feng Sun, and Qi Zhang. *Auto search indexer for end-to-end document retrieval*. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2023, pages 6955â€“6970, 2023.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive understanding of the datasets utilized in the research and their respective references.
