To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sexism detection: The first corpus in Algerian dialect with a code-switching in Arabic/French and English" by Imane Guellil et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that a new hate speech corpus (Arabic_fr_en) has been developed, which suggests that there is a dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **methodology section**, particularly in **section 4.1 (Dataset creation)**. Here, the authors describe the data collection process, stating that they collected **373,984 comments** from YouTube related to videos about women. They mention that they randomly selected **5,000 comments** for annotation, which were then labeled as hateful or non-hateful.

The paper also describes the creation of two datasets:
1. **Corpus_1**: This dataset contains **3,798 comments** that were annotated with the same labels by three annotators, with **792 comments labeled as hateful** and **3,006 as non-hateful**.
2. **Corpus_2**: A balanced version of Corpus_1, containing **1,798 comments**, where all hateful comments were included along with a random selection of non-hateful comments.

I will also check the **references section** for full citations related to the datasets. However, since the authors created the corpus themselves, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Imane Guellil, Ahsan Adeel, Faical Azouaou, Mohamed Boubred, Yousra Houichi, Akram Abdelhaq Moumna. *Sexism detection: The first corpus in Algerian dialect with a code-switching in Arabic/French and English*. (2023).

Now, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Arabic_fr_en Corpus**: A hate speech corpus developed for detecting hate speech against women in the Arabic community, containing a total of **373,984 comments** collected from YouTube, with **5,000 comments** selected for annotation.

2. **Corpus_1**: Contains **3,798 comments** with **792 labeled as hateful** and **3,006 as non-hateful**.

3. **Corpus_2**: A balanced dataset containing **1,798 comments**, including all hateful comments and a random selection of non-hateful comments.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
