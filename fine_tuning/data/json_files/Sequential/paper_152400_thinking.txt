To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bach in 2014: Music Composition with Recurrent Neural Network" by I-Ting Liu and Bhiksha Ramakrishnan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction discusses the use of recurrent neural networks for music composition, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Training Data)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they state that they used **J.S. Bach’s Chorale MIDI dataset**, which contains 384 four-part harmonizations. This is a clear identification of a dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the J.S. Bach Chorale MIDI dataset. The authors reference a work by Allan & Williams (2005) that discusses the dataset and its splits. The citation I need to extract is:

> Allan, Moray and Williams, Christopher KI. *Harmonising chorales by probabilistic inference*. Advances in neural information processing systems, 17:25–32, 2005.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for context.
2. Focus on the experiments section to identify datasets.
3. Extract the full citation from the references.

This method ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research and provide proper citations for them.
