To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Development of a digital tool for monitoring the behaviour of pre-weaned calves using accelerometer neck-collars" by Oshana Dissanayake et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves **accelerometer data** collected from **30 pre-weaned calves**, which suggests that there is a dataset related to calf behavior.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, where the authors describe the data collection process. They mention that the calves were equipped with a **3-D accelerometer** for two months, resulting in **27.4 hours of observation** aligned with the accelerometer data. This indicates that the dataset consists of time-series data from the accelerometers, annotated with observed behaviors.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their machine learning models, which were trained and tested on the collected data. They mention that the dataset was split into training and testing sets, confirming that the data is structured for analysis.

Now, I will look for specific details about the dataset, such as its name, size, and any relevant characteristics. The paper does not provide a formal name for the dataset, but it can be referred to as the **Calf Behavior Dataset** based on its content.

Next, I will check the **references section** for any citations related to the dataset or the methodologies used. The authors reference several studies that may have contributed to their methodology, but they do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself. However, I can still compile the relevant citations for the methodologies and tools used in the study.

Here are the citations I will include:

1. **BORIS Software**:

2. **ROCKET Method**:

3. **Accelerometer Features**:

Springer.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, including its name, description, and the relevant citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive understanding of the dataset used in the study, even if it is not formally named in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing or review.
