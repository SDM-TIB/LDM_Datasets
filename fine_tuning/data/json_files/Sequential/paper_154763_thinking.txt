To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Kernel Gaussian Process Based Financial Market Predictions" by Yong Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the experiments are performed on a dataset covering all constituents of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange Component Index, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe the dataset in the **data preparation** section, where they provide details about the market data of constituent stocks in the Shenzhen Stock Exchange Component Index (SZSE COMP). They specify that the dataset includes daily returns of 38 constituent stocks from January 1, 2013, to July 12, 2017.

Now, I will gather the necessary details about the dataset:

1. **Shenzhen Stock Exchange Component Index (SZSE COMP)**: This dataset includes daily returns of 38 constituent stocks from January 1, 2013, to July 12, 2017. The authors mention that the dataset is crucial for their empirical study and trading strategy design.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the SZSE COMP dataset itself, as it is a commonly used financial dataset. Instead, the authors mention that the data was collected from Wind Information Co., Ltd, which is a recognized source for financial data in China.

Since the dataset is derived from a well-known index, I will note that the citation for the dataset can be attributed to the source of the data collection:

- For the **Shenzhen Stock Exchange Component Index (SZSE COMP)** dataset, the citation is:
  > Wind Information Co., Ltd. (https://www.wind.com.cn/).

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the gathered information, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and structured entry for the dataset that can be used for further analysis or processing.
