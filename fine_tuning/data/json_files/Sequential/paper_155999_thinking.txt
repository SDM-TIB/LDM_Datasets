To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GreekBART: The First Pretrained Greek Sequence-to-Sequence Model" by Iakovos Evdaimon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate GreekBART on a newly introduced summarization dataset for the Greek language, which suggests that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the limitations of existing models for the Greek language and mention their contributions, including the creation of the GreekSUM dataset. This section confirms the existence of a dataset specifically designed for summarization tasks in Greek.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in the subsection titled **GreekSUM**, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they created. They describe how they collected data from the "News24/7" website, covering various categories and the process of filtering and preparing the dataset for use. This section is crucial as it provides specifics about the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **experiments section** where the authors mention using GreekSUM for evaluation. This reinforces the importance of this dataset in their research.

Now, I will compile the necessary details for the datasets:

1. **GreekSUM Dataset**: This dataset is introduced as the first summarization dataset for the Greek language, created by scraping articles from the "News24/7" website. It includes two tasks: GreekSUM Title and GreekSUM Abstract, with specific statistics provided about the number of documents and average lengths of summaries.

Next, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citation for the GreekSUM dataset. Since the dataset is created by the authors themselves, I will cite it as follows:

- For **GreekSUM Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Iakovos Evdaimon, Hadi Abdine, Christos Xypolopoulos, Stamatis Outsios, Michalis Vazirgiannis, and Giorgos Stamou. *GreekSUM: A Summarization Dataset for the Greek Language*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset details and citations, ready to format them according to the required structure for further processing or review.
