To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "LSTM Framework for Classification of Radar and Communications Signals" by Victoria Clerico et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a new radar dataset called **DeepRadar2022** and mention using the **RadioML 2018.01A** communications dataset. This suggests that both datasets are significant for their research.

Next, I will examine **section III (Signal Model and Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **RadioML 2018.01A**: This dataset contains 2,555,904 signals with various modulation types and SNR ranges. It is crucial to note the specific characteristics and limitations mentioned by the authors.

2. **DeepRadar2022**: This is a newly created dataset by the authors, consisting of 782,000 radar signals across 23 modulation types. The section provides detailed parameters for the signals, which are essential for understanding the dataset's structure.

Additionally, the authors mention a third dataset, which is a reproduction of an **8-class radar signal dataset** from previous literature. This dataset is used for comparison purposes.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **RadioML 2018.01A**, the citation is:
  > O'Shea, T. J., Roy, T., & Clancy, T. C. (2018). Over-the-Air Deep Learning Based Radio Signal Classification. *IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing*, 12(1), 168-179.

- For **DeepRadar2022**, since it is a dataset created by the authors, I will cite it as follows:
  > Clerico, V., González-López, J., Agam, G., & Grajal, J. (2022). DeepRadar2022: A Radar Dataset for Signal Classification. Available at: https://www.deepsig.ai/datasets

- For the **8-class radar signal dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wei, S., Qu, Q., et al. (2021). Self-attention Bi-LSTM Networks for radar signal modulation recognition. *IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques*, 69(11), 5160-5172.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
