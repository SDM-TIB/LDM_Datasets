To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3D-CLMI: A Motor Imagery EEG Classification Model via Fusion of 3D-CNN and LSTM with Attention" by Shiwei Cheng and Yuejiang Hao, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **BCI Competition IV dataset 2a**, which indicates that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Dataset and Preprocessing)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. In **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, they describe two datasets:

1. **BCI Competition IV 2a**: This dataset consists of EEG data from 9 participants performing a four-class motor imagery task (left-hand, right-hand, feet, and tongue movements). The dataset is derived from two sets of experiments conducted on different days, with specific details about the experimental setup and data collection.

2. **Experimental Dataset**: This dataset was collected from 12 participants (6 females and 6 males) performing a similar four-class motor imagery task. The authors describe the experimental setup and the data acquisition process in detail.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citation for the **BCI Competition IV 2a dataset** is:

- M. Tangermann et al. "Review of the BCI competition IV," *Frontiers in Neuroscience*, 2012. https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2012.00055.

For the **Experimental Dataset**, since it is a dataset collected by the authors themselves, it may not have a formal citation. However, I will note that it is based on their own experimental setup.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **BCI Competition IV 2a**: A public dataset consisting of EEG data from 9 participants performing motor imagery tasks. The dataset is widely used in BCI research.

2. **Experimental Dataset**: A dataset collected by the authors from 12 participants for the purpose of validating their proposed model.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
