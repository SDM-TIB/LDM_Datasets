To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Active Sensing for Communications by Learning" by Foad Sohrabi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, as this is where authors typically detail the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets," "Data Collection," or "Experimental Setup."

In this paper, the authors discuss two applications of their proposed framework: **adaptive beamforming for mmWave beam alignment** and **adaptive RIS sensing for reflection alignment**. I will check if they mention any datasets related to these applications.

As I read through the relevant sections, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and how they were used in the experiments.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like the **Penn Action Dataset** or any other dataset, I will ensure to find the complete citation for it, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.
