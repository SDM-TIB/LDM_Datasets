To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Novel EEG based Schizophrenia Detection with IoMT Framework for Smart Healthcare" by Geetanjali Sharma and Amit M. Joshi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their model on two different datasets, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Methodology)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used. They mention two publicly available datasets:

1. **Dataset 1**: This dataset consists of EEG signals from 14 subjects diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and 14 healthy controls. The EEG data was collected using a multi-channel setup (19 channels) and is publicly available from the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology in Warsaw, Poland. The authors provide details about the subjects, data collection methods, and preprocessing steps.

2. **Dataset 2**: This dataset includes EEG recordings from 84 subjects (39 healthy controls and 45 schizophrenia patients) aged 11-14 years. The data was recorded at the Laboratory for Neurophysiology and Neuro-Computer Interface at Lomonosov Moscow State University. The authors also describe the data collection and preprocessing methods for this dataset.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Dataset 1**, the citation is:
  > Olejarczyk, E., & Jernajczyk, W. (2017). Graph-based analysis of brain connectivity in schizophrenia. *PLoS One*, 12(11), e0188629.

- For **Dataset 2**, the citation is:
  > Laboratory for Neurophysiology and Neuro-Computer Interface at Lomonosov Moscow State University. (2016). EEG dataset for schizophrenia classification. *Available online*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its respective citation, which is crucial for proper attribution in research.
