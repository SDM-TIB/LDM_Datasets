To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Assessing Text Mining and Technical Analyses on Forecasting Financial Time Series" by Ali Lashgari, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the study's focus and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions that the study investigates the accuracy of text mining and technical analyses in forecasting the S&P500 stock market index, which suggests that financial data is involved.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Methodology and Data Set)**, where the author explicitly discusses the datasets used in the study. Here, I find that the paper utilizes:

1. **S&P500 Price Data**: This dataset consists of daily closing prices of the S&P500 index, sourced from Investing.com. The data spans two years, from January 2019 to December 2020.

2. **Financial Video News Data**: This dataset includes text data from various financial video news sources such as CNBC, Bloomberg, and Yahoo Finance. It also covers the same two-year period, providing insights into market trends during the pandemic.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are not attributed to specific papers or publications, I will note that the S&P500 data is sourced from Investing.com, and the financial news data is derived from multiple news outlets without specific citations.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant citations or sources, even if they are not traditional academic references.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that the information is clear and accurately reflects the content of the paper.
