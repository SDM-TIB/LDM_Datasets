To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Object Tracking through Residual and Dense LSTMs" by Fabio Garcea et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, while the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of visual object tracking and mention the use of hybrid trackers. However, they do not specify any datasets yet, so I will continue to the next sections.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experimental results)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention that their experiments were conducted on the **ILSVRC2014 DET** and **ILSVRC2017 VID** datasets. This is a crucial finding, as it indicates the datasets utilized in their research.

I will then look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **References section** to obtain the full citations:

1. For the **ILSVRC2014 DET dataset**, the citation is:
   > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3), 211â€“252, 2015.

2. For the **ILSVRC2017 VID dataset**, the citation is:
   > Hu, J., et al. *The ILSVRC 2017 Video Object Detection Challenge*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will involve summarizing the key characteristics of each dataset, such as the number of images or videos, the types of annotations provided, and their relevance to the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or processing.
