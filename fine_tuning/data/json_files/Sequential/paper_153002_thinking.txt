To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Network Pruning via Transformable Architecture Search" by Xuanyi Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental analysis sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet**, which suggests these are the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Analysis)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images across 10 classes.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, but with 100 classes instead of 10.
3. **ImageNet**: A larger dataset containing 1.28 million training images and 50,000 test images across 1,000 classes.

The authors also provide details about the data augmentation techniques used for these datasets, which further confirms their relevance to the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255, 2009.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will prepare the data for structured output or further processing.
