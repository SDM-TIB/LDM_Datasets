To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mining Temporal Evolution of Knowledge Graphs and Genealogical Features for Literature-Based Discovery Prediction" by Nazim Choudhury et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of literature-based discovery and the need for effective datasets to analyze scientific knowledge. This section may hint at the specific datasets used in their research.

Next, I will focus on the **section titled "Scholarly Datasets"**. Here, the authors explicitly mention two datasets related to their study:

1. **Gs (Sleep Apnea Dataset)**: This dataset consists of 29,203 articles published between 2007 and 2016, with 12,721 unique keywords. It focuses on the topic of sleep apnea.

2. **Go (Obesity Dataset)**: This dataset contains 107,745 articles, also published between 2007 and 2016, with 11,643 unique keywords. It pertains to the topic of obesity.

The authors provide detailed statistics about these datasets, including the number of articles and keywords, which confirms their relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors mention that the datasets were extracted from **Scopus**, the largest abstract and citation database of peer-reviewed literature. However, since Scopus is a database and not a specific dataset, I will note that the datasets are derived from it.

The citations for the datasets can be summarized as follows:

- For **Gs (Sleep Apnea Dataset)**, the citation is:
  > Choudhury, N., Faisal, F., & Khushi, M. (2019). Mining Temporal Evolution of Knowledge Graphs and Genealogical Features for Literature-Based Discovery Prediction. *Preprint*.

- For **Go (Obesity Dataset)**, the citation is the same as above since both datasets are part of the same study.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the key details, including the dataset names, descriptions, and citations. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented for future reference or analysis.
