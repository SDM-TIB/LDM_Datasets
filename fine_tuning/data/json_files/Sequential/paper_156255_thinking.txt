To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid of representation learning and reinforcement learning for dynamic and complex robotic motion planning" by Chengmin Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for training or evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. I will look for any sections explicitly labeled as "Datasets" or similar, where the authors might list the datasets they used for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay attention to any references to simulators or environments used for training and testing the algorithms. For instance, the paper mentions the "circle-crossing simulator" and "square-crossing simulator." I will need to confirm if these are datasets or just environments.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to the datasets or simulators mentioned. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will extract the full citations for those datasets.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as they appear in the references section. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring clarity and completeness in the dataset descriptions, including their names, purposes, and citations.
