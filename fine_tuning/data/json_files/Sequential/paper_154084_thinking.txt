To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Investigation on Deep Learning with Beta Stabilizer" by Qi Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that two data corpora are prepared for experiments: a local 15 hours Chinese dataset and a Switchboard 50 hours English dataset. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section IV) to gather more details about these datasets. The authors describe the local Chinese dataset as containing 15 hours of data for training, while the Switchboard dataset is specified as containing 50 hours of English data. This confirms that both datasets are used in the experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The Switchboard dataset is referenced as follows:

- For the **Switchboard dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. J. Godfrey, E. C. Holliman, and J. McDaniel. "SWITCHBOARD: telephone speech corpus for research and development." In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, vol. 1, pp. 517â€“520, 1992.

The local Chinese dataset does not have a specific citation provided in the references, as it appears to be a dataset created for the purposes of this research. Therefore, I will note it as an internal dataset without a formal citation.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **Local 15 hours Chinese dataset**: This dataset is used for training in the experiments but lacks a formal citation.
2. **Switchboard 50 hours English dataset**: This dataset is well-documented and has a full citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the necessary details and citations for each dataset as I prepare for the structured output.
