To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Latency-Aware Differentiable Neural Architecture Search" by Yuhui Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in the research.

Next, I will specifically look for sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, I will identify any datasets mentioned, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their use in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention two datasets:

1. **CIFAR10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 colored natural images across 10 categories, with a resolution of 32x32 pixels. It is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

2. **ImageNet**: Specifically, the ILSVRC2012 subset of ImageNet is used, which contains 1,000 object categories and approximately 1.28 million training images and 50,000 validation images.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I find are:

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Tech. rep., Citeseer.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.J., Li, K., Fei-Fei, L. (2009). ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets relevant to the research and their proper citations.
