To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Direct Differentiable Augmentation Search" by Aoming Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors discuss their method's performance on standard image classification benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors detail their methodology and results. In this section, they mention using **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet**, and **COCO** datasets for their experiments. I will take note of these datasets and look for specific details about each one.

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset is a well-known benchmark in machine learning, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 60,000 images but is divided into 100 classes, with 600 images per class.

3. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset used for image classification, containing over 14 million images across 20,000 categories. The authors specifically mention using a subset of 120 classes for their experiments.

4. **COCO (Common Objects in Context)**: This dataset is widely used for object detection and segmentation tasks, containing over 330,000 images with more than 2.5 million object instances labeled across 80 object categories.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The relevant citations for the datasets are:

- For **CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, 2009.

- For **ImageNet**:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009.

- For **COCO**:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Doll√°r, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing.
