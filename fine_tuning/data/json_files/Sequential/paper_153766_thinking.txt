To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SiTGRU: Single-Tunnelled Gated Recurrent Unit for Abnormality Detection" by Habtamu Fanta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the proposed method is evaluated on "CUHK Avenue and UCSD datasets," which indicates that these datasets are used in the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets and Setting)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and testing their model. Here, I will find specific information about each dataset, including their characteristics and the number of videos or frames they contain.

In this section, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **CUHK Avenue Dataset**: This dataset consists of videos captured at the Chinese University of Hong Kong campus, containing 16 training and 21 testing videos with a total of 15,328 frames in the training set and 15,324 frames in the testing set. The dataset includes pixel-level masks for ground truth annotation.

2. **UCSD Ped1 Dataset**: This dataset includes 34 training and 36 testing videos, with frames having a resolution of 238 × 158 pixels. The test videos are sliced into 200 frames, and it provides full frame-level ground truth annotation and pixel-level annotation for 10 videos.

3. **UCSD Ped2 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 16 training and 12 testing videos, with a resolution of 360 × 240 pixels. The test videos are sliced into varying numbers of frames (120, 150, and 180), and it includes frame-level and pixel-level ground truth annotation for all test videos.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **CUHK Avenue Dataset**:
  > C. Lu, J. Shi, and J. Jia. *Abnormal event detection at 150 fps in matlab*. In International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2720–2727, 2013.

- For **UCSD Ped1 Dataset**:
  > W. Li, V. Mahadevan, and N. Vasconcelos. *Anomaly detection and localization in crowded scenes*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), 36(1):18–32, 2014.

- For **UCSD Ped2 Dataset**:
  > W. Li, V. Mahadevan, and N. Vasconcelos. *Anomaly detection and localization in crowded scenes*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), 36(1):18–32, 2014.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
