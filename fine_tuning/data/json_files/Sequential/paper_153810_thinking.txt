To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Greenhouse Gas Emission Prediction on Road Network Using Deep Sequence Learning" by Lama Alfaseeh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and data collection sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the development of a deep learning framework for predicting greenhouse gas emissions, which suggests that data is involved, but I need to find specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the lack of microscopic data for GHG emissions at a link level, indicating that they may have created or used a specific dataset for their study. 

Next, I will focus on the **data collection section** where the authors describe their methodology for synthesizing data. They mention using an agent-based traffic microsimulation to generate high-resolution data points for GHG emissions. This indicates that the dataset is synthesized rather than sourced from existing datasets.

The authors specify that they generated data for two different time intervals: **30 seconds and 1 minute**. They also mention that the data includes traffic characteristics such as speed, density, and flow, recorded every minute, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** for any datasets or methodologies referenced in the paper. The authors refer to the **Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES)** developed by the USEPA for generating GHG emission rates. The citation for MOVES is:
> USEPA. Exhaust emission rates for light-duty on-road vehicles in MOVES2014: Final report, 2015.

Additionally, the authors reference the **Transportation Tomorrow Survey (TTS)** for travel demand data, which is another important dataset. The citation for TTS is not explicitly provided in the paper, so I will note that it may need to be sourced from external references.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Synthetic GHG Emission Dataset**: Generated using an agent-based traffic microsimulation, capturing link-level GHG emissions at a high temporal resolution (30 seconds and 1 minute intervals).
2. **MOVES Emission Rates**: Used to estimate GHG emissions based on vehicle-specific power.
   - Citation: USEPA. Exhaust emission rates for light-duty on-road vehicles in MOVES2014: Final report, 2015.
3. **Transportation Tomorrow Survey (TTS)**: Provides time-dependent exogenous demand matrices.
   - Citation: (To be sourced externally as it is not provided in the paper).

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its respective citation for future reference or analysis.
