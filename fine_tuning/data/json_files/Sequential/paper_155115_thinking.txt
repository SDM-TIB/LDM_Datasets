To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mixture-of-Variational-Experts for Continual Learning" by Heinke Hihn and Daniel A. Braun, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses continual learning and mentions the evaluation of their method, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their evaluations. Here, they mention several benchmarks, including **Split MNIST**, **Permuted MNIST**, and **Split CIFAR-10/100**. These are likely the datasets used for their experiments, and I will need to gather more details about each.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide descriptions of the tasks associated with these datasets. For instance, they explain that the Split MNIST dataset consists of five binary classification tasks derived from the original MNIST dataset, while the Split CIFAR-10 dataset involves dividing the ten classes into five binary classification tasks. This gives me a clear understanding of how these datasets are structured and utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For **CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. Available at: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary information is included for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
