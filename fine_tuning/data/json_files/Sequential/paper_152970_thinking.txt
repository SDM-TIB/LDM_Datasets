To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Budgeted Training: Rethinking Deep Neural Network Training Under Resource Constraints" by Mengtian Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments conducted on several well-known datasets, which suggests that I should look for specific names in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors mention that their experiments involve "ImageNet, Kinetics, MS COCO, and Cityscapes." This gives me a clear indication of the datasets used in their research.

I will then proceed to the **experiments** section, particularly focusing on **section 4**, where the authors detail their experimental setup. In this section, they describe the datasets used for various tasks:

1. **ImageNet**: A widely used dataset for image classification tasks, containing millions of labeled images across thousands of categories.
2. **Kinetics**: A large-scale dataset for video classification, focusing on human actions, with various versions available (e.g., Kinetics-400).
3. **MS COCO**: A dataset for object detection and instance segmentation, known for its rich annotations and diverse set of images.
4. **Cityscapes**: A dataset specifically designed for semantic segmentation in urban environments, featuring high-quality pixel-level annotations.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:

Berg, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211–252, 2015.

- For **Kinetics**, the citation is:

- For **MS COCO**, the citation is:

- For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:
  > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding*. In CVPR, 2016.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
