To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data Proxy Generation for Fast and Efficient Neural Architecture Search" by Minje Park, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and mentions the use of large-scale datasets, which suggests that specific datasets may be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the author describes the experiments conducted. In this section, the author mentions using the **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100** datasets for evaluating the proposed data proxy method. This is a clear indication that these datasets are relevant to the research.

I will then look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the paper. The author provides information about the CIFAR10 dataset, stating that it consists of 50,000 training samples and 10 classes, with each class containing 5,000 samples. Similarly, for CIFAR100, the author notes that it consists of 100 classes, each containing 500 samples.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The CIFAR datasets are commonly referenced in the literature, so I will ensure to provide the correct citations:

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

Both datasets are derived from the same source, so they share the same citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
