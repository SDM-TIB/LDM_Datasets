To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RTFN: Robust Temporal Feature Network" by Zhiwen Xiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the RTFN was evaluated on **85 datasets in the UCR2018 archive**, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for understanding the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail their experimental setup. In **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, they explicitly state that they used **85 standard datasets from the UCR2018 archive** for the supervised structure and **11 datasets** for the unsupervised clustering. This section is key for identifying the datasets used.

In **section 4.2 (Evaluation of the RTFN-based Supervised Structure)**, the authors provide a table (Table 1) that summarizes the performance of various algorithms on the 85 datasets. However, the specific names of these datasets are not listed in this section.

To find the actual dataset names, I will look at **Table 2**, which lists details about **12 long time-series datasets** used for further evaluation. The datasets mentioned here are:

1. **Beetlefly**: 20 training samples, 20 testing samples, 2 classes, length 512.
2. **BirdChicken**: 20 training samples, 20 testing samples, 2 classes, length 512.
3. **Car**: 60 training samples, 60 testing samples, 4 classes, length 577.
4. **Earthquakes**: 322 training samples, 139 testing samples, 2 classes, length 512.
5. **Herring**: 64 training samples, 64 testing samples, 2 classes, length 512.
6. **Haptics**: 155 training samples, 308 testing samples, 5 classes, length 1092.
7. **Lightning2**: 60 training samples, 61 testing samples, 2 classes, length 637.
8. **OliveOil**: 30 training samples, 30 testing samples, 4 classes, length 570.
9. **SemgHandGenderCh2**: 300 training samples, 600 testing samples, 2 classes, length 1500.
10. **SemgHandMovementCh2**: 450 training samples, 450 testing samples, 6 classes, length 1500.
11. **SemgHandSubjectCh2**: 450 training samples, 450 testing samples, 5 classes, length 1500.
12. **Rock**: 20 training samples, 50 testing samples, 4 classes, length 2844.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are part of the UCR2018 archive, I will refer to the original source of the UCR time series archive for the citation.

The citation for the UCR time series archive is:
> H. A. Dau, A. Bagnall, K. Kamgar, C.-C. M. Yeh, Y. Zhu, S. Gharghabi, C. A. Ratanamahatana, and E. Keogh. *The UCR time series archive*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.07758v2, 2019.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the UCR time series archive as the authoritative source for the datasets used in the experiments.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation.
