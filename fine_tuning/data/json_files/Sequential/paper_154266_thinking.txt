To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Learning Approach to Robot-Agnostic Force-Guided High Precision Assembly" by Jieliang Luo and Hui Li, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of robotic assembly and the need for adaptable systems. However, they do not specify any datasets here either. Next, I will look into the **methodology and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are referenced.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors describe two specific assembly tasks: **lap-joint** and **peg-in-hole**. However, they do not mention any datasets in the traditional sense, such as publicly available datasets or benchmark datasets. Instead, they describe the environments used for training and evaluation, which are robotless simulations designed to test their approach.

Since there are no datasets explicitly named in the paper, I will check the **references section** to see if any external datasets are cited that may have been used in the experiments. However, the references primarily consist of related works and do not point to specific datasets.

Given that the paper focuses on a novel approach and does not utilize existing datasets, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Lap-Joint Task Environment**: This is a custom simulation environment created for the purpose of the study, but it is not a publicly available dataset.
2. **Peg-in-Hole Task Environment**: Similar to the lap-joint task, this is also a custom simulation environment and not a dataset.

Since there are no formal datasets to cite, I will note that the authors did not utilize any external datasets in their experiments. Instead, they developed their own simulation environments for testing their robot-agnostic policies.

In conclusion, I will document that the paper does not reference any datasets in the conventional sense, but rather describes custom environments for their experiments. Therefore, there are no citations to provide for datasets as none exist in this context.
