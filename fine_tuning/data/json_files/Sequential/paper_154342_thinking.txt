To extract datasets from the research paper titled "E-commerce Query-based Generation based on User Review" by Yiren Liu and Kuan-Ying Lee, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments using a "real-world e-commerce dataset," which indicates that a specific dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly state the dataset used for training and validation. They mention using the **Amazon Review Data**, specifically filtering for the Amazon Fashion subcategory and excluding items with fewer than 20 reviews to ensure robustness. This section provides the necessary details about the dataset's context and selection criteria.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Amazon Review Data. The paper references the dataset as follows:

- **Amazon Review Data**: 
  > Jianmo Ni, Jiacheng Li, and Julian McAuley. *Justifying Recommendations using Distantly-Labeled Reviews and Fine-Grained Aspects*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), pages 188â€“197, Hong Kong, China. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Since the authors do not provide a specific citation for the Amazon Review Data in the paper, I will use the citation from the reference that discusses the dataset's application.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation for the Amazon Review Data as required. This will allow for proper attribution and facilitate further research or inquiries regarding the dataset.
