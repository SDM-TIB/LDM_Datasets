To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data Programming: Creating Large Training Sets, Quickly" by Alexander Ratner et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of creating labeled training sets and hints at the use of programmatic methods, but does not specify any datasets yet.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three applications: the 2014 TAC-KBP Slot Filling task, a genomics application, and a pharmacogenomics application. I will look for specific datasets associated with these applications.

In the **experiments section**, the authors state that they validated their approach on large real-world text relation extraction tasks in genomics, pharmacogenomics, and news domains. They mention using a "blind hand-labeled evaluation set" for their experiments, but I need to find the specific datasets used for training.

Upon further reading, I find that they refer to the following datasets:

1. **2014 TAC-KBP Slot Filling Dataset**: This dataset is used for the news application, where they extract relations between real-world entities from articles. The authors do not provide a specific citation in the text, so I will need to look for the reference in the **References section**.

2. **Genomics Dataset**: This dataset is used to extract causal relations between genetic mutations and phenotypes from scientific literature. Again, the authors do not provide a specific citation, so I will check the references.

3. **Pharmacogenomics Dataset**: This dataset is used for extracting interactions between genes from scientific literature. The citation for this dataset is also not provided in the text.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The references may include papers or resources that describe these datasets in detail.

After reviewing the references, I find the following citations:

- For the **2014 TAC-KBP Slot Filling Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Angeli, G., Gupta, S., Jose, M., Manning, C. D., Ré, C., Tibshirani, J., Wu, J. Y., & Zhang, C. (2014). Stanford’s 2014 slot filling systems. In TAC KBP.

- For the **Genomics Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mallory, E. K., Zhang, C., Ré, C., & Altman, R. B. (2015). Large-scale extraction of gene interactions from full-text literature using DeepDive. Bioinformatics.

- For the **Pharmacogenomics Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Doğan, R. I., & Lu, Z. (2012). An improved corpus of disease mentions in PubMed citations. In Proceedings of the 2012 workshop on biomedical natural language processing.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I have extracted the following datasets from the paper:

1. **2014 TAC-KBP Slot Filling Dataset**
   - Citation: Angeli et al. (2014). Stanford’s 2014 slot filling systems. In TAC KBP.

2. **Genomics Dataset**
   - Citation: Mallory et al. (2015). Large-scale extraction of gene interactions from full-text literature using DeepDive. Bioinformatics.

3. **Pharmacogenomics Dataset**
   - Citation: Doğan & Lu (2012). An improved corpus of disease mentions in PubMed citations. In Proceedings of the 2012 workshop on biomedical natural language processing.

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately identified and documented the datasets used in the research paper, along with their full citations.
