To extract datasets from the research paper titled "High Fidelity Speech Synthesis with Adversarial Networks" by Mikołaj Bińkowski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions the introduction of GAN-TTS for text-to-speech synthesis, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction discusses the advancements in text-to-speech (TTS) but again does not name any datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (GAN-TTS)**, particularly **subsection 3.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for training their models. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of high-fidelity audio of human speech along with linguistic features and pitch information. They specify that the dataset contains 44 hours of audio sampled at 24kHz, which is crucial information for dataset documentation.

The authors do not provide a specific name for the dataset they used, but they describe its characteristics in detail. Since they do not cite a specific dataset, I will note that the dataset is formed from recordings by a professional voice actor in North American English, but I will not be able to provide a formal citation for it.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any datasets mentioned that are commonly used in the field of speech synthesis or that may have been used in their experiments. However, the references primarily cite other research papers and models rather than specific datasets.

Since the paper does not provide a formal name or citation for the dataset used, I will summarize the information I have gathered:

1. **Dataset Description**: The dataset consists of high-fidelity audio recordings of human speech, with corresponding linguistic features and pitch information. The total length of the dataset is 44 hours, and the audio is sampled at 24kHz.

2. **Citation**: As there is no specific dataset name or citation provided in the paper, I will note that this dataset is not formally cited.

In conclusion, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to highlight the lack of a formal dataset citation while providing a detailed description of the dataset characteristics as mentioned in the paper. This will help in documenting the dataset extraction process effectively.
