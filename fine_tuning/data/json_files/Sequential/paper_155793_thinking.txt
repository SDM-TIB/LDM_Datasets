To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ham2Pose: Animating Sign Language Notation into Pose Sequences" by Rotem Shalev Arkushin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. In the abstract, the authors mention validating their method using **AUTSL**, a large-scale sign language dataset. This indicates that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will examine the **Data** section (Section 4) in detail, as it is likely to contain explicit mentions of datasets used in the research. Here, the authors describe their dataset, which consists of **5,754 videos of sign language signs with their HamNoSys transcriptions**. They specify that the data is collected from three sources:

1. **DGS Corpus**: This corpus is mentioned as one of the sources for the dataset.
2. **Dicta-Sign**: Another source from which data is collected.
3. **Corpus-based dictionary of Polish Sign Language**: This is the third source mentioned.

The authors provide a breakdown of the dataset, indicating the number of signs and signers for different sign languages included in the dataset, which adds valuable context.

In the **Evaluation** section (Section 7), the authors validate their distance measurement method using the **AUTSL** dataset again, confirming its significance in their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **AUTSL dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ozge Mercanoglu Sincan and Hacer Yalim Keles. *AUTSL: A large scale multi-modal Turkish sign language dataset and baseline methods*. IEEE Access, 8:181340–181355, 2020.

- For the **DGS Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Siegmund Prillwitz, Thomas Hanke, Susanne König, Reiner Konrad, Gabriele Langer, and Arvid Schwarz. *DGS Corpus Project – Development of a corpus based electronic dictionary German Sign Language/German*. In sign-lang@ LREC 2008, pages 159–164. European Language Resources Association (ELRA), 2008.

- For the **Dicta-Sign**, the citation is:
  > Silke Matthes, Thomas Hanke, Anja Regen, Jakob Storz, Satu Worseck, Eleni Efthimiou, Athanasia-Lida Dimou, Annelies Braffort, John Glauert, and Eva Safar. *Dicta-sign - building a multilingual sign language corpus*. In 5th Workshop on the Representation and Processing of Sign Languages: Interactions between Corpus and Lexicon. Satellite Workshop to the eighth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC-2012), 2012.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
