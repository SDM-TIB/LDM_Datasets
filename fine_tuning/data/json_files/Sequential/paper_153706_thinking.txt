To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identity Recognition in Intelligent Cars with Behavioral Data and LSTM-ResNet Classifier" by Michael Hammann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors use data from the **NUDrive** and **UTDrive** datasets, which indicates that these are the primary datasets used in their research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about the datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of identity recognition in cars and mentions behavioral features, but it does not provide specific details about the datasets.

I will then focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for training their models. Here, they state that they train on subsets of the **UTDrive** and **NUDrive** datasets. The paper provides some details about the data collection methods, such as the sampling rates and the types of signals collected (brake and accelerator pedal pressures).

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. For the **NUDrive dataset**, the citation is:
   > Takeda, K., Hansen, J.H., Boyraz, P., Malta, L., Miyajima, C., Abut, H. *International large-scale vehicle corpora for research on driver behavior on the road*. IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 12(4), 1609–1623, 2011.

2. For the **UTDrive dataset**, the citation is:
   > Angkititrakul, P., Hansen, J.H., Choi, S., Creek, T., Hayes, J., Kim, J., Kwak, D., Noecker, L.T., Phan, A. *UTDrive: The smart vehicle project*. In-vehicle corpus and signal processing for driver behavior, pp. 55–67, Springer, 2009.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **NUDrive**: A dataset containing multiple drives of ten drivers, collected at a sampling rate of 1 kHz, focusing on pedal pressure signals.
- **UTDrive**: A dataset containing multiple drives of five drivers, collected at a sampling rate of 100 Hz, also focusing on pedal pressure signals.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations to ensure that all information is organized and ready for further processing or review.
