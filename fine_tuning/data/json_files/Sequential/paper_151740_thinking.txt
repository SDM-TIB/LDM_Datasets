To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Sparse Structured Ensembles with SG-MCMC and Network Pruning" by Yichi Zhang and Zhijian Ou, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on two experiments, one involving the **MNIST dataset** for image classification and the other using the **Penn Treebank (PTB) corpus** for language modeling. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 5) to gather more details about how these datasets were used. In this section, the authors explicitly mention the **MNIST dataset** and the **Penn Treebank corpus**. They provide context on how the MNIST dataset is used for training Feed-forward Neural Networks (FNNs) and how the PTB corpus is utilized for training Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
   > Deng, L. (2012). The MNIST database of handwritten digit images for machine learning research. *IEEE Signal Processing Magazine*, 29(6), 141-142.

2. For the **Penn Treebank corpus**, the citation is:
   > Marcus, M. P., Marcinkiewicz, M. A., & Santorini, B. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313-330.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are ready for review or further processing, maintaining the integrity of the citations and the clarity of the dataset descriptions.
