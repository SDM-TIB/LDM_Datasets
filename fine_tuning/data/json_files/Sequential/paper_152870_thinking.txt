To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-to-End Visual Speech Recognition for Small-Scale Datasets" by Stavros Petridis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors report improvements on several databases, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** and specifically look for a section that discusses the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention four datasets: **OuluVS2**, **CUAVE**, **AVLetters**, and **AVLetters2**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including the number of speakers, utterances, and any specific characteristics mentioned.

In the **Databases section**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of each dataset:

1. **OuluVS2**: Contains 52 speakers repeating 10 utterances, with a total of 156 examples per utterance. The mouth ROIs are downscaled to 26 by 44 pixels.

2. **CUAVE**: Comprises 36 subjects who repeat each digit from 0 to 9 five times, resulting in 180 examples per digit. The mouth ROIs are downscaled to 30 by 50 pixels.

3. **AVLetters**: Involves 10 speakers saying letters A to Z three times, totaling 30 utterances per letter. The mouth ROIs are downscaled to 30 by 40 pixels.

4. **AVLetters2**: Contains 5 speakers saying letters A to Z seven times, resulting in 35 utterances per letter. The mouth ROIs are downscaled to 30 by 45 pixels.

After gathering the dataset descriptions, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
