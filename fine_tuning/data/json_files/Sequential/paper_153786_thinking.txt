To extract datasets from the research paper titled "g2pM: A Neural Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion Package for Mandarin Chinese Based on a New Open Benchmark Dataset" by Kyubyong Park and Seanie Lee, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss the dataset** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors introduce a new benchmark dataset for Chinese polyphone disambiguation, which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (The CPP (Chinese Polyphones with Pinyin) Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they created. Here, they describe the dataset as consisting of **99,264 sentences** specifically designed for Chinese polyphone disambiguation. This section will likely contain the necessary details about the dataset's structure, purpose, and characteristics.

In this section, I will note the following key points about the dataset:
- The dataset is named **Chinese Polyphones with Pinyin (CPP)**.
- It includes **99,264 sentences** with annotations for polyphonic characters.
- The sentences are filtered to ensure they contain polyphonic characters, and they are annotated by native speakers.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors mention that the CPP dataset is freely available via their GitHub repository, which is a crucial detail for citation purposes.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Kyubyong Park and Seanie Lee. *g2pM: A Neural Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion Package for Mandarin Chinese Based on a New Open Benchmark Dataset*. Available at: https://github.com/kakaobrain/g2pM.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
