To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CodePAD: Sequence-based Code Generation with Pushdown Automaton" by Yihong Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on four public benchmark datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this case, I find that the authors explicitly list the datasets in **section 6.1 (PL and Datasets)**. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **CONALA**: This dataset contains 2,879 real-world data of manually annotated natural language questions and their corresponding Python3 solutions sourced from Stack Overflow.

2. **DJANGO**: This dataset consists of 18,805 natural language-annotated Python2 code snippets extracted from the Django web framework.

3. **JUICE-10K**: This dataset includes 10,000 training samples randomly selected from the training set of the JUICE dataset, with validation and test sets consistent with those of JUICE.

4. **MBPP**: This dataset contains 974 Python programming problems, where each sample consists of a natural language description, a code snippet, and three test cases.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **CONALA**, the citation is:
  > Yin, P., & Neubig, G. (2018). CONALA: A large-scale dataset for natural language to code generation. In EMNLP (1), pages 5435–5445.

- For **DJANGO**, the citation is:
  > Oda, Y., Fudaba, H., Neubig, G., Hata, H., Sakti, S., Toda, T., & Nakamura, S. (2015). Learning to generate pseudo-code from source code using statistical machine translation. In 2015 30th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE), pages 574–584.

- For **JUICE-10K**, the citation is:
  > Agashe, R., Iyer, S., & Zettlemoyer, L. (2019). Juice: A large scale distantly supervised dataset for open domain context-based code generation. In EMNLP/IJCNLP (1), pages 5435–5445.

- For **MBPP**, the citation is:
  > Austin, J., Odena, A., Nye, M. I., Bosma, M., Michalewski, H., Dohan, D., Jiang, E., Cai, C. J., Terry, M., Le, Q. V., & Sutton, C. (2021). Program synthesis with large language models. CoRR, abs/2108.07732.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research in the field.
