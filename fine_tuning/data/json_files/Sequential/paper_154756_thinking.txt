To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RST Parsing from Scratch" by Thanh-Tung Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses a novel approach to discourse parsing but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of discourse parsing and reference Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **experiments section** to look for any datasets used in their evaluations.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using the **English RST Discourse Treebank (RST-DT)** for training and evaluation. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized. I will note this dataset and look for more details.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the RST-DT dataset. The citation for the RST Discourse Treebank is:

- **RST Discourse Treebank**: 
  > Lynn Carlson, Daniel Marcu, and Mary Ellen Okurowski. *RST Discourse Treebank (RST-DT)*. LDC2002T07. Linguistic Data Consortium, 2002.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **RST Discourse Treebank (RST-DT)**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation in the context of discourse parsing.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. The dataset entry will include the name of the dataset and its full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured accurately.
