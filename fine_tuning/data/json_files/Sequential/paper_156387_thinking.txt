To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Efficient Self-Supervised Cross-View Training For Sentence Embedding" by Peerat Limkonchotiwat et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on **seven Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental settings section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention using two NLI datasets: **SNLI** and **MultiNLI**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are part of their experiments.

I will also check the **evaluation setup section** (Section 4.3) where the authors provide more details about the datasets used for the STS benchmarks. They specifically mention the following datasets:

1. **STS-B**: A benchmark dataset for semantic textual similarity.
2. **SICK-R**: Another dataset used for evaluating semantic similarity.
3. **STS 2012-2016**: A collection of datasets from various years for semantic textual similarity tasks.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **SNLI**, the citation is:
  > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In EMNLP 2015.

- For **MultiNLI**, the citation is:
  > William Yang, Mark Gardley, and others. *Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference Dataset*. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing.

- For **STS-B**, the citation is:
  > Daniel Cer, Mona Diab, Eneko Agirre, Iñigo Lopez-Gazpio, and Lucia Specia. *SemEval-2017 task 1: Semantic textual similarity multilingual and crosslingual evaluation*. In Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2017).

- For **SICK-R**, the citation is:
  > Marco Marelli, Stefano Menini, Marco Baroni, Luisa Bentivogli, Raffaella Bernardi, and Roberto Zamparelli. *A SICK cure for the evaluation of compositional distributional semantic models*. In Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’14).

- For **STS 2012-2016**, the citations are:
  > Eneko Agirre, Carmen Banea, Daniel Cer, Mona Diab, Aitor Gonzalez-Agirre, Rada Mihalcea, German Rigau, and Janyce Wiebe. *SemEval-2012 task 6: A pilot on semantic textual similarity*. In *SEM 2012: The First Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations to ensure proper documentation and attribution. This structured approach will help in accurately extracting and presenting the datasets used in the research paper.
