To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Robust Approach for the Decomposition of High-Energy-Consuming Industrial Loads with Deep Learning" by Jia Cui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the focus on load decomposition for industrial park loads, which suggests that there may be specific datasets used for this purpose.

Next, I will examine **section 1 (Introduction)** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors discuss the challenges in non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) and the lack of datasets for high-energy-consuming industrial loads. This indicates that they may have used specific datasets in their research.

In **section 5 (Numerical Results)**, the authors mention using the load data of an industrial park in Liaoning Province in 2019. This is a specific dataset that I need to note. Additionally, they reference the **REDD dataset** as an auxiliary training dataset, which is also important to include.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **Industrial Park Load Data**: The authors do not provide a formal citation for this dataset, but they mention it as the load data collected from an industrial park in Liaoning Province in 2019. I will note this as a dataset used in their study.

2. **REDD Dataset**: The citation for the REDD dataset is:
   > Kolter, J. Z., & Johnson, M. J. (2011). *REDD: A Public Data Set for Energy Disaggregation Research*. In Proceedings of the SustKDD Workshop on Data Mining Applications in Sustainability (SustKDD).

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Industrial Park Load Data**: Collected from an industrial park in Liaoning Province in 2019, used for evaluating the proposed algorithm.
- **REDD Dataset**: A publicly available dataset used as auxiliary training data for improving the accuracy of the decomposition results.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
