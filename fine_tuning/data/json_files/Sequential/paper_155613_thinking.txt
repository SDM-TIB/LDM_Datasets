To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantum Machine Learning for Material Synthesis and Hardware Security" by Collin Beaudoin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of the **USPTO-50K dataset** for chemical retrosynthesis, which indicates that this dataset is significant for the research.

Next, I will examine the **background** section, specifically subsection 2.1, where the authors describe the **USPTO-50K dataset** in detail. It is stated that this dataset consists of 40,000 training, 5,000 validation, and 5,000 testing SMILES formatted chemical examples. This section provides essential information about the dataset's structure and purpose.

Additionally, I will look into the **hardware Trojan detection** section (subsection 3.2) to find details about another dataset used in the study. The authors mention a **Trojan feature dataset** consisting of 50 features derived from Trojan-free and Trojan-infected circuits, which is crucial for their experiments. They describe the dataset's creation and the number of samples, which is important for understanding its context.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. For the **USPTO-50K dataset**, the citation is:
   > Daniel Mark Lowe. *Extraction of chemical structures and reactions from the literature*. Ph.D. Dissertation. University of Cambridge, 2012.

2. For the **Trojan feature dataset**, the citation is:
   > Bicky Shakya, Tony He, Hassan Salmani, Domenic Forte, Swarup Bhunia, and Mark Tehranipoor. *Benchmarking of hardware trojans and maliciously affected circuits*. Journal of Hardware and Systems Security 1, 1 (2017), 85â€“102.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
