To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Robot to Shape your Natural Plant: The Machine Learning Approach to Model and Control Bio-Hybrid Systems" by Mostafa Wahby et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of machine learning to model plant behavior and mentions a benchmark task of obstacle avoidance, which suggests that datasets related to plant behavior might be included.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that describe the experimental setup and data collection. In this section, the authors detail their bio-hybrid setup and the data collection process, which involves recording plant growth patterns in response to light stimuli. This indicates that there is a dataset related to the stem motion and growth of the common bean plant.

In **section 3.2.2 (Stem motion tracking)**, the authors describe how they processed images from their dataset experiments to create a 10-point description of the plant stem. This suggests that they have a dataset that captures the geometry and motion of the plant stem over time.

I will also look for any specific mentions of datasets in the **results section** where they discuss the performance of their models. If they refer to specific datasets used for training or validation, I will note those down.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details. I will also check the **references section** for full citations of any datasets or related works mentioned.

Based on the information gathered, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **Stem Shape Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the experimental data recorded during the bio-hybrid setup, capturing the stem geometry of the common bean plant under various light stimuli conditions.

2. **LSTM Training Dataset**: This dataset is created from the processed stem motion tracking data, which is used to train the LSTM model for predicting plant behavior.

Next, I will find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference their previous work, which may contain the necessary citations for the datasets used.

For the **Stem Shape Dataset**, I will cite:

For the **LSTM Training Dataset**, I will cite:

In IEEE 10th International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems (SASO), pages 21–30. IEEE.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately represented the datasets used in the research paper.
