To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sentiment Analysis for Sinhala Language using Deep Learning Techniques" by Lahiru Senevirathne et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present a dataset of **15,059 Sinhala news comments** annotated with four sentiment classes. This suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they created. They mention that the dataset consists of comments extracted from two sources: **GossipLanka** and **Lankadeepa**. The paper states that it is the largest sentiment-annotated dataset for Sinhala, which is significant.

In **subsection 3.2 (Annotation)**, the authors describe the annotation process, confirming that the dataset includes **15,059 comments** with labels for **POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL, and CONFLICT** sentiments. This further solidifies the importance of this dataset.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the original dataset from Liyanage (2018), which is the only previously available dataset for sentiment analysis in Sinhala. The citation for this dataset is:

- For **Liyanage (2018)**:
  > Isuru Udara Liyanage. *Sentiment Analysis of Sinhala News Comments*. (2018). Unpublished.

Additionally, the authors mention that their dataset is based on comments from **GossipLanka** and **Lankadeepa**, but they do not provide formal citations for these sources as datasets. However, I will note that these are the sources from which the comments were extracted.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Dataset Name**: Sinhala Sentiment Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset of 15,059 Sinhala news comments annotated with four sentiment classes (POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL, CONFLICT).
   - **Source**: Comments extracted from GossipLanka and Lankadeepa.
   - **Citation**: 
     > Isuru Udara Liyanage. *Sentiment Analysis of Sinhala News Comments*. (2018). Unpublished.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
