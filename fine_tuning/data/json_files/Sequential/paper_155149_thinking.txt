To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Learning an Adaptive Meta Model-Generator for Incrementally Updating Recommender Systems" by Danni Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method on **three public datasets and one industrial dataset**, which suggests that there are specific datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Tmall Dataset**: This dataset contains user-item interaction records from Tmall.com, with specific details about the number of users, items, and interactions.

2. **Sobazaar Dataset**: This dataset includes user-item interaction records from the Sobazaar mobile app, with information on the number of users and interactions.

3. **MovieLens Dataset**: The authors refer to the largest 25M dataset from MovieLens, detailing how they processed the data for their experiments.

4. **Lazada Dataset**: This is an industrial dataset collected from the Lazada mobile app, with specifics on the number of samples, users, and items.

I will ensure to note down the key characteristics of each dataset, such as the number of users, items, and interactions, as well as any relevant preprocessing steps mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations will be crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the sources of the datasets.

For the **Tmall Dataset**, I will cite:
> Tmall Dataset. (2014). Retrieved from https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/dataDetail?dataId=42

For the **Sobazaar Dataset**, I will cite:
> Sobazaar Dataset. (2014). Retrieved from https://github.com/hainguyen-telenor/Learning-to-rank-from-implicit-feedback

For the **MovieLens Dataset**, I will cite:
> MovieLens Dataset. (2018). Retrieved from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

For the **Lazada Dataset**, I will cite:
> Lazada Dataset. (2020). Retrieved from https://www.lazada.com/

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of use in future references or analyses.
