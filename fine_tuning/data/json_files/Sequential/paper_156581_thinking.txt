To extract datasets from the research paper titled "P2LHAP: Wearable sensor-based human activity recognition, segmentation and forecast through Patch-to-Label Seq2Seq Transformer" by Shuangjian Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the method is evaluated on **three public datasets**, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for a subsection that discusses the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention three datasets: **WISDM**, **PAMAP2**, and **UNIMIB SHAR**. I will extract the relevant details about each dataset from this section.

1. **WISDM Dataset**: This dataset was collected from 29 participants using mobile phones with triaxial accelerometers. It includes six activities: walking, strolling, ascending stairs, descending stairs, standing still, and standing. The data was sampled at a frequency of 20 Hz.

2. **PAMAP2 Dataset**: This dataset consists of data collected from nine participants who wore IMUs on their chest, hand, and ankle. It includes 12 mandatory activities and 6 optional activities, capturing various sensor data types.

3. **UNIMIB SHAR Dataset**: Collected by researchers at the University of Milan-Bicocca, this dataset includes data from 30 volunteers equipped with Bosch BMA220 sensors. It contains 17 categories of activities, including activities of daily living and falling behaviors.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **WISDM Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **PAMAP2 Dataset**, the citation is:

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
