To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Hierarchical Importance Attribution: Explaining Compositional Semantics for Neural Sequence Models" by Xisen Jin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors conducted evaluations on "multiple datasets," which indicates that there are specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention using two sentiment analysis datasets: 

1. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank-2 (SST-2)**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis tasks and provides sentiment polarity scores for phrases on the nodes of constituency parsing trees.

2. **Yelp Sentiment Polarity dataset**: Another dataset used for sentiment analysis, which contains reviews and their corresponding sentiment labels.

Additionally, the authors mention using the **TACRED relation extraction dataset** for their experiments, which is a dataset designed for relation extraction tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank-2 (SST-2)**, the citation is:
  > Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J., Chuang, J., Manning, C. D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2013). *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing (EMNLP), pp. 1631–1642.

- For the **Yelp Sentiment Polarity dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, X., Zhao, J., & LeCun, Y. (2015). *Character-level convolutional networks for text classification*. In Advances in neural information processing systems, pp. 649–657.

- For the **TACRED relation extraction dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, Y., Zhong, V., Chen, D., Angeli, G., & Manning, C. D. (2017). *Position-aware attention and supervised data improve slot filling*. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 35–45.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
