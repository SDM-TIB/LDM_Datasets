To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can we learn gradients by Hamiltonian Neural Networks?" by Aleksandr Timofeev et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **MNIST dataset**, which is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition. This is a clear indication that I need to gather more details about this dataset.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section III) to confirm the use of the MNIST dataset and to check if there are any additional datasets mentioned. In the experiments, the authors specifically state that they optimized a base network on the MNIST dataset, which confirms its use. They also mention an "artificial task" but do not provide a specific dataset name for it. Therefore, I will focus on the MNIST dataset for extraction.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is widely cited, and I can refer to its original source:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Since the paper does not provide a specific citation for the artificial task dataset, I will only include the MNIST dataset in my final output.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for the MNIST dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will be ready for review or further processing.
