To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Short-Term Electricity Demand Forecasting of Dhaka City Using CNN with Stacked BiLSTM" by Kazi Fuad Bin Akhter et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the study involves forecasting electricity demand using real-world data, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically **section IV (Dataset Collection)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their study. They mention that the dataset consists of daily electricity consumption data for Dhaka city, collected from the Bangladesh Power Development Board and the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, covering the years 2016 to 2021 with a total of 2190 observations. This is a clear identification of the dataset used in their research.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for the sources of the dataset. The authors reference the Bangladesh Power Development Board and the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh as the sources of their data. Since these are official government organizations, I will note them as the authoritative sources for the dataset.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format. The dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **Daily Electricity Consumption Data of Dhaka City**: This dataset includes daily electricity consumption data from 2016 to 2021, collected from the Bangladesh Power Development Board and the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh.

The full citation for the dataset source is:
- Bangladesh Power Development Board. *Daily Generation Reports*. Available: http://bd.bpdb.gov.bd/bpdb/daily_generation
- Power Grid Company of Bangladesh. *Official Data*. Available: https://pgcb.gov.bd/

After gathering this information, I will ensure that the dataset entry is clear and includes all necessary details, including the time period, the nature of the data, and the sources from which it was obtained. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
