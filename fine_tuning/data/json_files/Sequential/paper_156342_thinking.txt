To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mean-AP Guided Reinforced Active Learning for Object Detection" by Zhixuan Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on **PASCAL VOC** and **MS COCO** benchmarks, indicating that these are the datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section IV, the authors provide details about the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **PASCAL VOC**: The paper states that it uses the VOC07+12 trainval set, which consists of 16,551 images across 20 classes, and the VOC07 test set with 4,952 images.

2. **MS COCO**: The authors mention using the train2017 set, which contains 117,000 images, and the val2017 set with 5,000 images, across 80 classes.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **PASCAL VOC**, the citation is:
  > M. Everingham, L. Van Gool, C. K. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. "The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge." *International Journal of Computer Vision*, vol. 88, no. 2, pp. 303–338, 2010.

- For **MS COCO**, the citation is:
  > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. "Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context." In *European Conference on Computer Vision*, Springer, 2014, pp. 740–755.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research along with their proper citations.
