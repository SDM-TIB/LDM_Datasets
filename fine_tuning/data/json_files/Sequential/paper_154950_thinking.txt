To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Hierarchical Entity Graph Convolutional Network for Relation Extraction across Documents" by Tapas Nayak and Hwee Tou Ng, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a dataset for two-hop relation extraction, which suggests that a specific dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the limitations of existing datasets and introduce their own two-hop relation extraction dataset. They mention that their dataset covers more relations than publicly available datasets, which is a key point.

In the **related work section**, the authors reference several existing datasets used for relation extraction, including:

1. **NYT10**: Created by mapping Freebase tuples to New York Times articles.
2. **NYT11**: Similar to NYT10, also based on New York Times articles.
3. **TACRED**: Derived from the TAC KBP evaluations.
4. **FewRel 2.0**: A few-shot relation extraction dataset.
5. **DocRED**: A document-level relation extraction dataset created using Wikipedia articles.

The authors also introduce their own dataset, referred to as **THRED** (two-hop relation extraction dataset), which is constructed from the WikiHop dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **References section**:

- For **NYT10**, the citation is:
  > Sebastian Riedel, Limin Yao, and Andrew McCallum. *Modeling relations and their mentions without labeled text*. In ECML and KDD, 2010.

- For **NYT11**, the citation is:
  > Raphael Hoffmann, Congle Zhang, Xiao Ling, Luke Zettlemoyer, and Daniel S Weld. *Knowledge-based weak supervision for information extraction of overlapping relations*. In ACL, 2011.

- For **TACRED**, the citation is:
  > Yuhao Zhang, Peng Qi, and Christopher D. Manning. *Graph convolution over pruned dependency trees improves relation extraction*. In EMNLP, 2018.

- For **FewRel 2.0**, the citation is:
  > Tianyu Gao, Xu Han, Hao Zhu, Zhiyuan Liu, Peng Li, Maosong Sun, and Jie Zhou. *FewRel 2.0: Towards more challenging few-shot relation classification*. In EMNLP and IJCNLP, 2019.

- For **DocRED**, the citation is:
  > Yuan Yao, Deming Ye, Peng Li, Xu Han, Yankai Lin, Zhenghao Liu, Zhiyuan Liu, Lixin Huang, Jie Zhou, and Maosong Sun. *DocRED: A large-scale document-level relation extraction dataset*. In ACL, 2019.

- For **THRED**, the citation is:
  > Tapas Nayak and Hwee Tou Ng. *A Hierarchical Entity Graph Convolutional Network for Relation Extraction across Documents*. In the paper itself, 2023.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, which can be useful for further research or analysis.
