To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explainable Deepfake Video Detection using Convolutional Neural Network and CapsuleNet" by Gazi Hasin Ishrak et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to delve deeper into the methodology and results for specific dataset details.

In the **methodology section**, the authors mention using the **DFDC dataset** for their model. They describe it as the largest Deepfake detection dataset, consisting of over 100,000 clips gathered from 3,426 paid actors, with unique target or source swaps. This is a significant dataset for their research.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the DFDC dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Brian Dolhansky et al. "The deepfake detection challenge dataset." In: arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.07397 (2020).

Since the DFDC dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information accordingly.

Now, I will summarize the findings for the dataset in a structured manner, ensuring that the full citation is included for clarity and proper attribution. This will allow for easy reference in future work or discussions regarding the research.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset used in the study, ready for any further processing or documentation needs.
