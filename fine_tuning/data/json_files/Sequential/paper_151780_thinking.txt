To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Constituency Parsing with a Self-Attentive Encoder" by Nikita Kitaev and Dan Klein, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the parser achieves state-of-the-art results on the **Penn Treebank** and the **SPMRL dataset**, indicating that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors discuss their results on the **Penn Treebank** and the **SPMRL dataset** in the results section, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will gather detailed descriptions of these datasets:

1. **Penn Treebank**: This dataset is widely used for training and evaluating parsers. The authors mention achieving a score of 95.13 F1 on the WSJ test set of the Penn Treebank, indicating its significance in their work.

2. **SPMRL Dataset**: The authors report that their model outperforms previous best results on 8 of the 9 languages in the SPMRL dataset, which is used for evaluating parsing across multiple languages.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Penn Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Marcus, M. P., Santorini, B., & Marcinkiewicz, M. A. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313-330.

- For the **SPMRL dataset**, the citation is:
  > Seddah, D., Tsarfaty, R., KÃ¼bler, S., Candito, M., Choi, J. D., Farkas, R., ... & Villemonte de la Clergerie, E. (2013). Overview of the SPMRL 2013 shared task: A cross-framework evaluation of parsing morphologically rich languages. In *Proceedings of the Fourth Workshop on Statistical Parsing of Morphologically-Rich Languages* (pp. 146-182). Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
