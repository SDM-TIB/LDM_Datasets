To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Slow-varying Dynamics Assisted Temporal Capsule Network for Machinery Remaining Useful Life Estimation" by Yan Qin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on an aircraft engine and a milling machine, suggesting that datasets related to these systems are likely included.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Result and Discussion)**, where the authors describe the experiments conducted on the aircraft engine and milling machine. Here, they mention the use of the **C-MAPSS dataset**, which is crucial for the aircraft engine experiments. The paper provides a detailed table summarizing the dataset characteristics, including:

1. **FD001**: Contains 100 training and 100 testing trajectories, with a single operating condition.
2. **FD002**: Contains 260 training and 259 testing trajectories, with six operating conditions.
3. **FD003**: Similar to FD001, with 100 training and 100 testing trajectories.
4. **FD004**: Contains 248 training and 249 testing trajectories, with six operating conditions.

The authors also mention that the datasets are collected from the NASA C-MAPSS simulation, which is a well-known dataset for RUL estimation tasks.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The relevant citation for the C-MAPSS dataset is:

- For the C-MAPSS dataset, the citation is:
  > E. Ramasso, and A. Saxena, “Performance benchmarking and analysis of prognostic methods for CMAPSS datasets,” *Int. J. Prog. Health Manage.*, vol. 5, pp. 1-15, 2014.

Additionally, the paper discusses the milling machine dataset, which is described as having 166 runs under various operating conditions. However, the specific citation for this dataset is not provided in the text, so I will note that it is based on experimental data collected by the authors.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the C-MAPSS dataset and a note regarding the milling machine dataset.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **C-MAPSS Dataset** (FD001, FD002, FD003, FD004) - Citation provided.
2. **Milling Machine Dataset** - No specific citation provided, but noted as experimental data collected by the authors.

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations for further processing or review.
