To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A comparison of LSTM and GRU networks for learning symbolic sequences" by Roberto Cahuantzi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the methodology and results sections, as these are likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of RNNs and their applications, but they do not mention specific datasets. I will move on to the **methodology** section, where they describe how they generated symbolic sequences for their experiments. Here, they mention that they produced a collection of strings with quantifiable complexities, referred to as "seed strings." This indicates that the dataset is synthetic and generated by the authors.

Next, I will look for any references to existing datasets or benchmarks in the **results section**. However, it appears that the authors primarily focus on their own generated data rather than using established datasets. They describe the process of creating these seed strings and how they are used for training and testing the RNN models.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets, I will note that the primary dataset used in this research is the synthetic dataset created by the authors. I will also check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the methods used for generating the datasets or any relevant literature that could provide context.

The authors mention a Python library called "slearn" that is available on GitHub, which is used to generate these synthetic sequences. I will include this as a reference for the dataset creation process.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

1. **Synthetic Seed Strings**: The dataset consists of symbolic sequences generated by the authors, which are used to evaluate the performance of LSTM and GRU networks. The complexity of these strings is quantifiable, and they are created using a Python library.

2. **Citation for the Dataset Creation**:
   > Cahuantzi R, Chen X, Guttel S. *slearn*. URL: https://github.com/nla-group/slearn

Since there are no other datasets mentioned in the paper, I will finalize my extraction process and prepare to present the findings in the required format.
