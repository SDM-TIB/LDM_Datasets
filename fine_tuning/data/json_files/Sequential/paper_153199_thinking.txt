To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conditional LSTM-GAN for Melody Generation from Lyrics" by Yi Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the creation of a large dataset consisting of **12,197 MIDI songs** with paired lyrics and melody alignment, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. In this paper, the authors describe the dataset creation process in **section V (Lyrics-Melody Data Acquirement)**. Here, they detail how they compiled the dataset from two sources:

1. **LMD-full MIDI Dataset**: This dataset contributed **7,998 MIDI files**.
2. **Reddit MIDI Dataset**: This dataset contributed **4,199 MIDI files**.

The total number of MIDI files in the dataset is **12,197**, which is explicitly stated in the paper. The authors also provide additional context about the dataset, such as the average length of melodies and the total duration of the music contained within.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the sources of the datasets as follows:

- For the **LMD-full MIDI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Colin Raffel. *LMD: The Lakh MIDI Dataset*. Available at: https://colinraffel.com/projects/lmd/.

- For the **Reddit MIDI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Reddit. *MIDI Dataset*. Available at: https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Dataset Name**: LMD-full MIDI Dataset
   - **Description**: A collection of MIDI files containing musical compositions.
   - **Citation**: Colin Raffel. *LMD: The Lakh MIDI Dataset*. Available at: https://colinraffel.com/projects/lmd/.

2. **Dataset Name**: Reddit MIDI Dataset
   - **Description**: A collection of MIDI files sourced from Reddit.
   - **Citation**: Reddit. *MIDI Dataset*. Available at: https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that the citations are complete and accurate for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
