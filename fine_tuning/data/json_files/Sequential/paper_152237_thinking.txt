To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gradients of Counterfactuals" by Mukund Sundararajan, Ankur Taly, and Qiqi Yan, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their method to the **GoogleNet architecture for object recognition** and a **ligand-based virtual screening network**, as well as an **LSTM-based language model for the Penn Treebank dataset**. This suggests that datasets are involved, particularly the Penn Treebank dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section** where the authors describe their experiments. In section 3.1, they mention the **Penn Treebank dataset** specifically for language modeling with an LSTM model. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its purpose and any relevant statistics.

In section 3.1, the authors state that they applied their technique to the **Penn Treebank dataset (Marcus et al., 1993)** for word-level language modeling. This confirms that the dataset is indeed used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Penn Treebank dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Marcus, M. P., Santorini, B., & Marcinkiewicz, M. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313-330.

Additionally, in section 3.1, the authors mention using a **ligand-based virtual screening network** developed by Kearnes et al. (2016). I will also look for the citation for this dataset. The citation is:
> Kearnes, S., McCloskey, K., Berndl, M., Pande, V., & Riley, P. (2016). Molecular graph convolutions: moving beyond fingerprints. *Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design*, 30(8), 595-608.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. 

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **Penn Treebank Dataset**: Used for language modeling with LSTM.
   - Citation: Marcus, M. P., Santorini, B., & Marcinkiewicz, M. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313-330.

2. **Ligand-Based Virtual Screening Dataset**: Used for predicting molecular activity.
   - Citation: Kearnes, S., McCloskey, K., Berndl, M., Pande, V., & Riley, P. (2016). Molecular graph convolutions: moving beyond fingerprints. *Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design*, 30(8), 595-608.

With this information, I am ready to create structured entries for each dataset as needed.
