To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Chem-FINESE: Validating Fine-Grained Few-shot Entity Extraction through Text Reconstruction" by Qingyun Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the release of **ChemNER+**, a new fine-grained chemical entity extraction dataset, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Benchmark Dataset)**, where the authors describe the creation of two datasets: 

1. **ChemNER+ Dataset**: This dataset is annotated by domain experts and is based on the ChemNER schema. It consists of 742 sentences covering 59 fine-grained chemistry types.

2. **CHEMET Dataset**: This dataset is constructed based on the existing CHEMET dataset and consists of 30 fine-grained organic chemical types.

In the **dataset creation section**, the authors provide details about how these datasets were constructed, including the number of sentences and the types of entities included. This confirms the existence of both datasets and provides context for their use.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **ChemNER+**, the citation is:
  > Wang, Q., Li, M., Chan, H. P., Huang, L., Hockenmaier, J., Chowdhary, G., & Ji, H. (2021). ChemNER: Fine-grained chemistry named entity recognition with ontology-guided distant supervision. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 5227–5240).

- For **CHEMET**, the citation is:
  > Sun, C., Li, W., Xiao, J., Parulian, N., Zhai, C., & Ji, H. (2021). Fine-grained chemical entity typing with multimodal knowledge representation. In 2021 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM) (pp. 1984–1991).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
