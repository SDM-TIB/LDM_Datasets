To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Overestimation of Syntactic Representation in Neural Language Models" by Jordan Kodner and Nitish Gupta, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of language models but does not specify any datasets. I will then check the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **main experiment section** (Section 2) and subsequent sections to identify any datasets utilized for training or testing the models. The authors mention using the **WikiText-103 corpus** for training LSTM language models, which is a significant dataset in the context of their experiments.

I will also look for any other datasets mentioned in the **experiments or discussion sections**. The paper references the **WikiText-2 corpus** in Section 3 for training n-gram models, which is another dataset of interest.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

1. For the **WikiText-103 corpus**, the citation is:
   > Stephen Merity, Nitish Gupta, Ekin Dogus Cubuk, and James Bradbury. *Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models*. In Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2018.

2. For the **WikiText-2 corpus**, the citation is:
   > Stephen Merity, Nitish Gupta, Ekin Dogus Cubuk, and James Bradbury. *Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models*. In Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2018.

Both datasets are crucial for understanding the experiments conducted in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
