To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Framework for End-to-End Deep Learning-Based Anomaly Detection in Transportation Networks" by Neema Davis, Gaurav Raina, and Krishna Jagannathan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **seven diverse real-world datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **section V (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors provide a description of the datasets used in their study. Here, they mention seven datasets, which I will list and describe:

1. **Vehicular Travel Time**: This dataset contains 2,500 readings from a traffic sensor collected between July 10, 2015, and September 17, 2015, with eight marked anomalies.

2. **Vehicular Speed**: This dataset includes 1,128 readings of average vehicle speed from September 8, 2015, to September 17, 2015, with three marked unusual sub-sequences.

3. **Vehicle Occupancy**: This dataset has 2,382 readings indicating the percentage of time a vehicle was detected during a 30-second period, collected over 17 days, with two marked anomalies.

4. **NYC Taxi Demand**: This publicly available dataset contains trip details of street-hailing yellow taxis from January 1, 2016, to February 29, 2016, with three time-sequences showing clear anomalies.

5. **Bengaluru Taxi Demand**: This dataset consists of GPS traces of passengers booking taxis via a mobile application, aggregated over 15-minute periods in January and February 2016, with three sequences showing clear anomalies.

6. **ECG (Electrocardiogram)**: This dataset contains 18,000 readings with three unusual sub-sequences labeled as anomalies, showing a repeating pattern with variability in period length.

7. **Bitcoin Prices**: Historical prices of Bitcoin from January 1, 2017, to May 27, 2019, with a low fraction of anomalies (0.06%) observed.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely sourced from publicly available repositories or prior studies.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the names and descriptions of each dataset, along with any relevant details that may assist in understanding their context and usage in the experiments.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and ready for further processing or review.
