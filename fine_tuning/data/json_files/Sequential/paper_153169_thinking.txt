To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Particle Swarm Optimisation for Evolving Deep Neural Networks for Image Classification" by Bin Wang, Bing Xue, and Mengjie Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that their method is evaluated on the **CIFAR-10 dataset** and transferred to **CIFAR-100** and **SVHN**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into the **introduction** section, where the authors mention the use of CIFAR-10 as a benchmark dataset for evaluating their method. They also highlight the transferability of the learned block to CIFAR-100 and SVHN, confirming that these datasets are indeed used in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, specifically under **section IV (Experiment Design)**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. They mention:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 color images across 10 classes, with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The authors note that it is widely used for evaluating image classifiers.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 60,000 images but is divided into 100 classes, making the classification task more complex.

3. **SVHN (Street View House Numbers)**: This dataset includes 73,257 training images and 26,032 test images, with additional training images totaling 531,131. It presents a different domain but has the same number of classes as CIFAR-10.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Tech. Rep., 2009.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yaniv Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. 2011.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **CIFAR-10** with citation: Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Tech. Rep., 2009.
2. **CIFAR-100** with citation: Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Tech. Rep., 2009.
3. **SVHN** with citation: Yaniv Netzer et al. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. 2011.

This thorough approach ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
