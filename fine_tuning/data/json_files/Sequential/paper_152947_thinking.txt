To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Evaluation of Transfer Learning for Classifying Sales Engagement Emails at Large Scale" by Yong Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used "in-house sales engagement email samples" as the experiment dataset, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experiments** section. In this section, the authors mention that they used a dataset consisting of **3840 initial replies from prospects** to sales development representatives. They also provide a breakdown of the labels and counts for the emails, which is important for understanding the dataset's structure.

I will then check the **tables** included in the paper, particularly **Table I**, which outlines the labels and the number of emails under each label. This table confirms the dataset's composition and provides additional context for its use in the experiments.

Since the dataset is described as "in-house," I will note that it does not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. However, I will still document it as follows:

1. **In-house Sales Engagement Email Dataset**: This dataset consists of 3840 labeled emails categorized into four classes: positive, objection, unsubscribe, and not-sure. The dataset is used to evaluate the performance of various transfer learning models in classifying email intent.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset's name, description, and any relevant details about its use in the experiments. Since this dataset is proprietary and does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is an in-house dataset created by the authors.

Finally, I will summarize the findings related to the dataset's performance in the context of the experiments conducted, highlighting how it contributed to the evaluation of transfer learning techniques.

In conclusion, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and its significance in the research, even though it lacks a traditional citation.
