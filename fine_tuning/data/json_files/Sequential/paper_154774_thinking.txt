To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Eco-Driving of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles with Sequence-to-Sequence Prediction of Target Vehicle Velocity" by Shobhit Gupta and Marcello Canova, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of Eco-Driving and the need for accurate velocity predictions. While they mention various studies, I will focus on sections that might directly reference datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly the part where the authors describe the data used for training the Gated Recurrent Unit Encoder-Decoder (GRU-ED) network. Here, they mention using a dataset called **Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM)**, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors may provide additional insights into how the dataset was utilized, including any splits for training and testing the model. This will help confirm the dataset's relevance and application in their research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the NGSIM dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Kovvali, V.G., Alexiadis, V., and Zhang, P.E. (2007). *Video-based vehicle trajectory data collection*. Technical report.

Since the NGSIM dataset is widely used in transportation research, I will ensure to highlight its significance in the context of the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including its name, description, and full citation, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details regarding the dataset used in the research.
