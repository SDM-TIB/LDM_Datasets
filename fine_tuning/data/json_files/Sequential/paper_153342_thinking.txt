To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RandAugment: Practical automated data augmentation with a reduced search space" by Ekin D. Cubuk et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions that RandAugment achieves state-of-the-art results on **CIFAR-10/100, SVHN, and ImageNet**, indicating that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **methods** and **results** sections, specifically focusing on any explicit mentions of datasets. In the **results section**, the authors provide detailed comparisons of their method's performance on various datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet. This confirms that these datasets are indeed utilized in their experiments.

I will also check the **experiments section** for any additional context or details about how these datasets were used. The authors describe their experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet, providing insights into the model architectures and performance metrics.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset from the **references section** of the paper:

1. **CIFAR-10**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.

3. **SVHN**:
   > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. In NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning, 2011.

4. **ImageNet**:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper along with their proper citations.
