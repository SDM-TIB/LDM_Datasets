To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Grounding in social media: An approach to building a chit-chat dialogue model" by Ritvik Choudhary and Daisuke Kawahara, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize a large set of filtered comment data from Reddit, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used in their work. Here, I find the following datasets listed:

1. **DailyDialog**: This dataset is described as containing 76,743 dialogue turns, with specific splits for training, validation, and testing.
2. **DailyDialog++**: An extension of DailyDialog, it contains 39,913 dialogue turns, also with specified splits.
3. **Cornell Movie-Dialogs**: This dataset includes 221,088 dialogue turns, with detailed splits for training, validation, and testing.
4. **Reddit (pseudo extracted)**: This dataset consists of 200,000 comment pairs extracted from Reddit, serving as a pseudo dialogue dataset.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **DailyDialog**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
