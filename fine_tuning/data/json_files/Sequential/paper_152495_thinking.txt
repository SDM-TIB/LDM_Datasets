To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning for Energy Markets" by Michael Polson and Vadim Sokolov, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors use **hourly price and demand data from 4719 nodes of the PJM interconnection**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges of predicting electricity prices and loads, and mention the use of deep learning models. They refer to the **PJM Interconnection** and its significance in the context of energy markets, which reinforces the importance of the dataset derived from this interconnection.

In the **section 2 (Energy Prices in PJM Interconnection)**, the authors provide detailed information about the **Locational Marginal Price (LMP)** data, which includes real-time and day-ahead hourly prices from **January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2017**. This section describes the dataset's components and its relevance to their analysis.

Additionally, in **section 5.2 (Demand Forecasting)**, the authors mention using hourly electricity load observations on the PJM interconnection, specifically stating that the data is available from a Dropbox link for the period from **January 2016 to May 2018**. This indicates another dataset that is essential for their forecasting model.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper:

1. **PJM Interconnection Data**: The citation for the PJM data is:
   > PJM. Daily real-time LMP: August 1, 2017 through September 7, 2017. URL http://www.pjm.com/markets-and-operations/energy/real-time/lmp.aspx.

2. **Hourly Electricity Load Data**: The citation for the hourly electricity load data is:
   > Data available at: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1dczb673bx9kxzl/AABII5ePMWdFhAk-dEcRGS1La?dl=0.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation. This will facilitate further analysis or reference in future work.
