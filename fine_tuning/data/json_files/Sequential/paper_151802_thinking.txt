To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards High Performance Video Object Detection for Mobiles" by Xizhou Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions achieving a 60.2% mAP score on the **ImageNet VID validation**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly state that they performed experiments on the **ImageNet VID** dataset, which consists of 3,862 training video snippets and 555 validation video snippets, involving 30 object categories.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet VID dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., Berg, A., Li, F.F. "ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge." In: IJCV, 2015.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **ImageNet VID**: A large-scale benchmark for video object detection, consisting of 3,862 training video snippets and 555 validation video snippets, with 30 object categories.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset.
