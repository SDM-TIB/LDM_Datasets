To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Social Style Characterization from Egocentric Photo-streams" by Maedeh Aghaei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using a dataset acquired by a user wearing a photo-camera over a month, which suggests that a specific dataset is involved.

Next, I will examine the **experimental results section** (section 3) where the authors discuss the evaluation of their proposed pipeline. Here, they mention a publicly available egocentric photo-stream dataset used for their experiments. I will look for specific details about this dataset, including its name, size, and any relevant characteristics.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide a summary of the dataset they used, referred to as the **EgoSocialStyle dataset**. The table includes key statistics such as the number of users, days of data collection, total images, social images, number of people, and sequences. This information is crucial for describing the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors refer to their previous work and other relevant studies, which may provide insights into the dataset's origin or related datasets.

The citation for the **EgoSocialStyle dataset** is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is implied that the dataset is part of the authors' own research contributions. Therefore, I will formulate a citation based on the information available in the paper:

- For the **EgoSocialStyle dataset**, the citation is:
  > Maedeh Aghaei, Mariella Dimiccoli, Cristian Canton Ferrer, and Petia Radeva. *Social Style Characterization from Egocentric Photo-streams*. In Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Machine Vision, pages 987514â€“987519, 2015.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and the full citation in a structured format for clarity and completeness. This will allow for easy reference and further analysis.
