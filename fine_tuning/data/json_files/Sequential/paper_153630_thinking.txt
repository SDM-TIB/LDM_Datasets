To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Program Synthesis for Images By Sampling Without Replacement" by Chenghui Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their algorithm on a **synthetic 2D CSG dataset** and a **2D CAD furniture dataset**, indicating that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset is generated using the context-free grammar (CFG) specified in the paper. It includes various shapes and operations to create images, and the authors provide statistics about the dataset size and complexity.

2. **2D CAD Furniture Dataset**: This dataset consists of binary 64 × 64 images of various furniture items. The authors reference a previous work for this dataset, which is crucial for proper citation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **synthetic dataset**, since it is generated by the authors, I will note that it does not have a formal citation but is described in detail in the paper itself.

- For the **2D CAD furniture dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gopal Sharma, Rishabh Goyal, Difan Liu, Evangelos Kalogerakis, and Subhransu Maji. *CSGNet: Neural Shape Parser for Constructive Solid Geometry*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 5515–5523, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: A dataset generated by the authors using CFG rules, containing various shapes and operations for image synthesis. No formal citation exists as it is a product of the authors' work.

2. **2D CAD Furniture Dataset**: A dataset of binary images representing furniture items, cited from the work of Sharma et al. (2018).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that the citations are complete and accurate for future use.
