To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WaveSense: Efficient Temporal Convolutions with Spiking Neural Networks for Keyword Spotting" by Philipp Weidel and Sadique Sheik, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their model on several datasets for keyword spotting, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.3 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for evaluation. This section is likely to contain the most relevant information about the datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any modifications made to them.

In **subsection 2.3.1 (ALOHA DATASET)**, the authors describe the Aloha dataset, which contains around 2000 audio samples of the keyword "Aloha" and various distractors. They also mention augmenting this dataset with noise from the MUSAN dataset. 

In **subsection 2.3.2 (HEY SNIPS DATASET)**, the authors detail the "Hey Snips" dataset, which consists of 11,000 utterances from over 2,000 speakers for the wake phrase "Hey Snips," along with a large number of negative examples. 

In **subsection 2.3.3 (SPEECH COMMANDS DATASET)**, the authors describe the Speech Commands dataset, which includes 35 keywords uttered 105,000 times by over 2,600 speakers. They note that this dataset is designed for keyword spotting and mention their approach to augmenting it with noise.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. 

1. For the **Aloha Dataset**, the citation is:
   > Peter Blouw, Xuan Choo, Eric Hunsberger, and Chris Eliasmith. *Benchmarking keyword spotting efficiency on neuromorphic hardware*. 2018.

2. For the **Hey Snips Dataset**, the citation is:
   > Alice Coucke, Mohammed Chlieh, Thibault Gisselbrecht, David Leroy, Mathieu Poumeyrol, and Thibaut Lavril. *Efficient keyword spotting using dilated convolutions and gating*. 2018.

3. For the **Speech Commands Dataset**, the citation is:
   > Pete Warden. *Speech commands: A dataset for limited-vocabulary speech recognition*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.03209, 2018.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
