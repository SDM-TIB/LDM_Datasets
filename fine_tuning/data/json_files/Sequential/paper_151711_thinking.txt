To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Code-Switching Language Modeling using Syntax-Aware Multi-Task Learning" by Genta Indra Winata et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluated their model on the **SEAME Phase I and Phase II datasets**, indicating that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of the datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges of code-switching and the need for data, which reinforces the importance of the datasets they are using.

In the **methodology section**, I will pay close attention to any details about the datasets, particularly in the subsections that describe the corpus used for training and evaluation. The authors explicitly state that they used the **SEAME (South East Asia Mandarin-English) corpus**, which consists of conversational Mandarin-English code-switching speech. They also mention that the dataset is sourced from the **Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC)**.

I will also check the **results section** to confirm that the authors refer to the SEAME datasets when discussing their experimental results. This will help ensure that I have accurately identified the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **SEAME Phase I and Phase II Datasets**: The citation for the SEAME corpus is:
   > Nanyang Technological University. 2015. *Mandarin-English code-switching in South-East Asia LDC2015S04*. Web download. Philadelphia: Linguistic Data Consortium.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: SEAME Phase I
  - **Description**: A conversational Mandarin-English code-switching speech corpus consisting of spontaneously spoken interviews and conversations.
  - **Citation**: Nanyang Technological University. 2015. *Mandarin-English code-switching in South-East Asia LDC2015S04*. Web download. Philadelphia: Linguistic Data Consortium.

- **Dataset Name**: SEAME Phase II
  - **Description**: An extension of the SEAME Phase I dataset, containing additional transcribed audio segments for improved evaluation.
  - **Citation**: Nanyang Technological University. 2015. *Mandarin-English code-switching in South-East Asia LDC2015S04*. Web download. Philadelphia: Linguistic Data Consortium.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
