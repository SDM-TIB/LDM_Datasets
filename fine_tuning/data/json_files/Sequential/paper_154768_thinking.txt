To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Safe Pontryagin Differentiable Programming" by Wanxin Jin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methodology and its applications, which may include references to datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 7 in this case) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used.

In this paper, the authors mention several systems and tasks, but I need to identify if they refer to any publicly available datasets or if they have created their own datasets for the experiments. I will also check for any references to datasets in the **related work section** or **appendices**, as these sections may provide additional context or citations.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to gather the full citations for each dataset. This may involve looking up the original papers or sources where the datasets were introduced or published. I will pay attention to the format of the citations, ensuring they include all necessary details such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for the citation:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

After compiling the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will summarize the findings in a clear and organized manner, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the information for output, ensuring it is structured and ready for any further processing or review.
