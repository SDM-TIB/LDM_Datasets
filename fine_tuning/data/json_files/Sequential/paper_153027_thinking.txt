To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretable Spatio-temporal Attention for Video Action Recognition" by Lili Meng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on several public video action recognition datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **HMDB51 Dataset**: This dataset contains 51 distinct action categories, with at least 101 clips for each category, totaling 6,766 video clips. It includes a variety of actions such as facial actions, body movements, and interactions with objects.

2. **UCF101 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 101 action categories and is composed of realistic action videos collected from YouTube.

3. **Moments in Time Dataset**: This dataset contains one million short videos, each labeled with one action, and includes 339 different action classes.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **HMDB51 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kuehne, H., Jhuang, H., Garrote, E., Poggio, T., & Serre, T. (2011). *HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition*. In ICCV.

- For **UCF101 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Soomro, K., Zamir, A. R., & Shah, M. (2012). *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402.

- For **Moments in Time Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Monfort, M., Zhou, B., Bargal, S. A., Andonian, A., Yan, T., Ramakrishnan, K., Brown, L., Fan, Q., Gutfruend, D., Vondrick, C., et al. (2019). *Moments in time dataset: One million videos for event understanding*. In IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
