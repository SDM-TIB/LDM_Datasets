To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning Approaches for Question Answering on Knowledge Bases: an evaluation of architectural design choices" by Sherzod Hakimov et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the task of answering natural language questions over knowledge bases and refers to the **SimpleQuestions dataset** as a frequently used dataset for this task. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, in the **introduction**, the authors provide a brief description of the **SimpleQuestions dataset**, stating that it consists of simple questions that can be answered with a single fact from the Freebase knowledge base. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use in the experiments.

In the **methods section**, the authors describe their Named Entity Recognition (NER) system and how it interacts with the SimpleQuestions dataset. They mention that the NER system was trained on the SimpleQuestions training split, which further emphasizes the dataset's importance in their research.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors discuss the performance of their models on the SimpleQuestions dataset, providing metrics such as accuracy for various tasks. This reinforces the dataset's role in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the SimpleQuestions dataset. The citation is not explicitly provided in the paper, but I can refer to the original paper that introduced the dataset:

- For the **SimpleQuestions dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Bordes, N. Usunier, S. Chopra, and J. Weston. *Large-scale simple question answering with memory networks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.02075, 2015.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **SimpleQuestions Dataset**: This dataset consists of simple questions that can be answered with a single fact from the Freebase knowledge base. It is used for training and evaluating the models in the paper.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
