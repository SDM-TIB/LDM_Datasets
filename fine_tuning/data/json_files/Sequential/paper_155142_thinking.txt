To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Single Image Deraining Network with Rain Embedding Consistency and Layered LSTM" by Yizhou Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a "real-world dataset" and "several synthetic datasets," which suggests that there are specific datasets used in their research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, particularly the subsections that discuss the datasets used for training and evaluation. In section 4.2, the authors mention using the **SPA-Data dataset**, which contains 638,492 training images and 1,000 test images. This dataset is crucial as it is highlighted for its high quality and relevance to the experiments conducted.

Additionally, in section 4.4, the authors refer to five synthetic benchmark datasets: **Rain100H**, **Rain200H**, **Rain100L**, **Rain200L**, and **Rain800**. These datasets are essential for evaluating the performance of the proposed methods under various rain conditions.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are important for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers who may want to access these datasets.

1. For the **SPA-Data dataset**, the citation is:
   > Tianyu Wang, Xin Yang, Ke Xu, Shaozhe Chen, Qiang Zhang, and Rynson WH Lau. *Spatial attentive single-image deraining with a high quality real rain dataset*. In Proc. of IEEE Conf. on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 12270–12279, 2019.

2. For the **Rain100H**, **Rain200H**, **Rain100L**, **Rain200L**, and **Rain800** datasets, the citation is:
   > Wenhan Yang, Robby T Tan, Jiashi Feng, Zongming Guo, Shuicheng Yan, and Jiaying Liu. *Joint rain detection and removal from a single image with contextualized deep networks*. IEEE Trans. on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 42(6):1377–1393, 2019.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **SPA-Data Dataset**: A high-quality dataset containing 638,492 training images and 1,000 test images, used for training and evaluating the proposed deraining methods.
- **Rain100H, Rain200H, Rain100L, Rain200L, Rain800 Datasets**: Synthetic datasets used to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods under various rain conditions.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that each dataset is properly cited. This will facilitate further research and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
