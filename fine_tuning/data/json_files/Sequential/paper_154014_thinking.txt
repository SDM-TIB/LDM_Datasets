To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Self-Attention Networks for Intent Detection" by Sevinj Yolchuyeva et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that they evaluate their system on several datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names in the following sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **Snips Dataset**: This dataset is described as a balanced dataset collected from the Snips personal voice assistant, containing 13,084 utterances for training and 700 utterances each for testing and validation.

2. **Smart Lights Dataset**: This dataset includes 6 intents related to controlling lights, with a vocabulary size of approximately 400 words.

3. **Smart Speaker Dataset**: This dataset consists of 9 intents and has a vocabulary size of around 1,270 words.

4. **ATIS Dataset**: This dataset contains audio recordings of people making flight reservations, with 4,478 utterances in the training set and 893 in the test set.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Snips Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chih-Wen Goo, Guang Gao, Yun-Kai Hsu, Chih-Li Huo, Tsung-Chieh Chen, Keng-Wei Hsu, and Yun-Nung Chen. *Slot-Gated Modeling for Joint Slot Filling and Intent Prediction*. In Proceedings of Annual Conference North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 753-757, 2018.

- For the **Smart Lights Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alaa Saade, Alice Coucke, Alexandre Caulier, Joseph Dureau, Adrien Ball, Théodore Bluche, David Leroy, Clément Doumouro, Thibault Gisselbrecht, Francesco Caltagirone, Thibaut Lavril, Maël Primet. *Spoken Language Understanding on the Edge*. CoRR, abs/1810.12735, 2018.

- For the **Smart Speaker Dataset**, the citation is included in the same reference as the Smart Lights dataset.

- For the **ATIS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Charles T. Hemphill, John J. Godfrey, and George R. Doddington. *The ATIS Spoken Language Systems Pilot Corpus*. In DARPA Speech and Natural Language Workshop, pages 96-101, 1990.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details and citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
