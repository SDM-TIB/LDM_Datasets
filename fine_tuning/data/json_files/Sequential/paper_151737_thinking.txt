To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Universal Music Translation Network" by Noam Mor et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on **NSynth** and a dataset collected from professional musicians, which indicates that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. They mention:

1. **NSynth Dataset**: This dataset contains audio samples of 1,006 instruments, each labeled with unique pitch, timbre, and envelope. Each sample is a four-second monophonic snippet at 16kHz, covering every pitch of a standard MIDI piano (21-108) and five different velocities. This dataset was not seen during the training of their system.

2. **Professional Musicians Dataset**: The authors refer to a dataset collected from various professional musicians, but they do not provide specific details about this dataset in the paper.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the NSynth dataset. The citation is as follows:

- For **NSynth Dataset**:
  > Engel, J., Resnick, C., Roberts, A., Dieleman, S., Norouzi, M., Eck, D., & Simonyan, K. (2017). Neural audio synthesis of musical notes with WaveNet autoencoders. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML).

Since the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset collected from professional musicians, I will note that it lacks a formal citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the NSynth dataset and note the absence of a citation for the dataset from professional musicians. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately for further processing or review.
