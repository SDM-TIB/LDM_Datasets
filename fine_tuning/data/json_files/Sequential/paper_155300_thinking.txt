To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Itâ€™s Raw! Audio Generation with State-Space Models" by Karan Goel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information and provide full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets used. In this paper, there is a **Table 1** that summarizes the characteristics of the datasets used for unconditional autoregressive generation experiments. This table lists three datasets: 

1. **Beethoven**: A dataset consisting of recordings of Beethoven's piano sonatas.
2. **YouTubeMix**: A dataset of piano music sourced from YouTube.
3. **SC09**: A dataset consisting of spoken digits from the Speech Commands dataset.

I will extract the relevant details for each dataset from the table, including total duration, chunk length, sampling rate, quantization, and splits.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Beethoven dataset**, the citation is:
  > Soroush Mehri, Kundan Kumar, Ishaan Gulrajani, Rithesh Kumar, Shubham Jain, Jose Sotelo, Aaron Courville, and Yoshua Bengio. *SampleRNN: An Unconditional End-to-End Neural Audio Generation Model*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2017.

- For the **YouTubeMix dataset**, the citation is:
  > DeepSound. *SampleRNN*. https://github.com/deepsound-project/samplernn-pytorch, 2017.

- For the **SC09 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pete Warden. *Speech Commands: A Dataset for Limited-Vocabulary Speech Recognition*. ArXiv, abs/1804.03209, 2018.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations for proper attribution.
