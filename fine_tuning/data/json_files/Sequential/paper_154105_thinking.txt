To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Speech Intelligibility in Text-To-Speech Synthesis using Speaking Style Conversion" by Dipjyoti Paul et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a novel transfer learning approach and refers to two types of data: Lombard speaking style data and SSDRC processed data. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for training their TTS systems. They refer to two publicly available databases:

1. **LJSpeech corpus**: This dataset consists of 13,100 short audio clips of a single female professional speaker reading passages. It is widely used for training TTS systems.

2. **Nick Hurricane Challenge speech data**: This dataset includes both normal and Lombard styles of British male voice professional speech. The normal speech consists of 2,592 utterances (approximately 2 hours), while the Lombard speech data has 720 utterances (approximately 30 minutes).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **LJSpeech corpus**, the citation is:
  > Keithito, “The LJspeech dataset,” https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/, 2017.

- For **Nick Hurricane Challenge speech data**, the citation is:
  > M. Cooke, C. Mayo, C. Valentini-Botinhao et al., “Hurricane natural speech corpus,” LISTA Consortium, Language and Speech Laboratory, Universidad del Pais., 2013.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper for future reference or processing.
