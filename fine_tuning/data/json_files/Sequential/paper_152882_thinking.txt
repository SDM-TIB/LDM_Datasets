To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Complexity-Weighted Loss and Diverse Reranking for Sentence Simplification" by Reno Kriz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a "large set of diverse candidate simplifications," which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the training or evaluation of the models.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they mention using the **Newsela Corpus** for training their models. This is a significant dataset for the task of sentence simplification, and I will need to gather details about it.

In section 4.1, the authors provide more context about the **Newsela Corpus**, stating that it consists of 1,840 news articles written at five different reading levels. They also mention that they filtered the data to exclude certain sentence pairs, which indicates that they have processed this dataset for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Newsela Corpus**. The citation is as follows:
> Xu, Wei, Callison-Burch, Chris, and Napoles, Courtney. "Problems in current text simplification research: New data can help." Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 3(1):283–297, 2015.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the **WikiLarge dataset** in section 4.1 as a comparison point for their work. I will also need to find the citation for this dataset.

The citation for the **WikiLarge dataset** is:
> Zhang, Xingxing, and Lapata, Mirella. "Sentence simplification with deep reinforcement learning." In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 584–594, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

In summary, the datasets I will extract from the paper are:
1. **Newsela Corpus** - Citation: Xu, Wei, Callison-Burch, Chris, and Napoles, Courtney. "Problems in current text simplification research: New data can help." Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 3(1):283–297, 2015.
2. **WikiLarge Dataset** - Citation: Zhang, Xingxing, and Lapata, Mirella. "Sentence simplification with deep reinforcement learning." In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 584–594, 2017.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring they are structured correctly for any further processing or review.
