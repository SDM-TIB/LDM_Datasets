To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TransDocs: Optical Character Recognition with word to word translation" by Abhishek Bamotra and Phani Krishna Uppala, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of the **ANKI dataset** for English to Spanish translation, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research. The introduction further elaborates on the integration of OCR with LSTM-based models, reinforcing the importance of the ANKI dataset.

Next, I will examine the **methods/models section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Data pre-processing)**, where the authors explicitly state that they used the **ANKI dataset** for training their translation model. This section provides details about the dataset's structure and the preprocessing steps taken, confirming its significance in the study.

Additionally, I will look into **section 4.2 (Data augmentation for misfit words)**, where the authors mention using the **TextRecognitionDataGenerator** to augment the dataset. This indicates that while the ANKI dataset is the primary dataset, the TextRecognitionDataGenerator is also relevant as it generates synthetic data for training.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **ANKI dataset**, the citation is:
   > http://www.manythings.org/anki/.

2. For the **TextRecognitionDataGenerator**, the citation is:
   > https://github.com/Belval/TextRecognitionDataGenerator.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are ready for review or further processing, maintaining clarity and accuracy in the representation of the datasets used in the research.
