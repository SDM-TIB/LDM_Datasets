To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Memristive LSTM network hardware architecture for time-series predictive modeling problems" by Kazybek Adam, Kamilya Smagulova, and Alex Pappachen James, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses time-series data and mentions the use of LSTM for forecasting, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Proposed Circuit)**, particularly the subsection **A (Problem description and LSTM overview)**. Here, the authors describe a dataset that demonstrates the change in the number of international airline passengers over a 12-year period with 144 observation points. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used.

I will note the details provided about the dataset, including how it was processed and normalized. The dataset is described as a single-column dataset converted into three columns for the LSTM model, but the authors do not provide a formal name for this dataset.

Since the dataset is based on historical data of airline passengers, I will need to find the original source of this dataset. I will check the **References section** to see if there is a citation that corresponds to this dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the airline passenger dataset, which is a common dataset used in time-series forecasting.

To ensure I have the correct citation, I will look for a well-known reference for the airline passenger dataset. The dataset is often attributed to:

- **International Airline Passengers Dataset**: 
  > Box, G. E. P., & Jenkins, G. M. (1970). *Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control*. Holden-Day.

This citation is widely recognized in the context of time-series analysis and is likely the source of the dataset mentioned in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the dataset:

1. **Dataset Name**: International Airline Passengers Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset containing monthly totals of international airline passengers over a 12-year period, with 144 observation points.
   - **Citation**: Box, G. E. P., & Jenkins, G. M. (1970). *Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control*. Holden-Day.

Finally, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution.
