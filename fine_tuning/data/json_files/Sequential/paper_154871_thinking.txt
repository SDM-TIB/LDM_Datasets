To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Long Short-Term Memory for AI Applications in Spike-based Neuromorphic Hardware" by Arjun Rao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to experiments that utilize specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, as it often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for experiments. In this paper, the authors discuss the use of the **MNIST dataset** for a time-series classification task. I will note the details provided about how the dataset is utilized, including any specific configurations or modifications made for the experiments.

Additionally, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST handwritten digit database*. AT&T Labs [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ (2010).

Furthermore, the paper mentions the **bAbI dataset** for testing relational reasoning tasks. I will extract the relevant details about this dataset from the methods section as well.

I will also look for the full citation for the bAbI dataset in the references section:
> Jason Weston, Antoine Bordes, Sumit Chopra, Alexander M. Rush, Bart van MerriÃ«nboer, Armand Joulin, and Tomas Mikolov. *Towards AI-complete question answering: A set of prerequisite toy tasks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1502.05698 (2015).

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets identified, ensuring to include their names, descriptions, and full citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
