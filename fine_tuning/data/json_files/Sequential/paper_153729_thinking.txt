To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SuperMix: Supervising the Mixing Data Augmentation" by Ali Dabouei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions the validation of SuperMix on two tasks: object classification and knowledge distillation, which suggests that datasets are involved, but does not specify their names.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the importance of data augmentation and mention that they validate their method on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets. This indicates that these two datasets are likely used in their experiments.

I will then look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate SuperMix on the **CIFAR-100** and **ImageNet** datasets. This confirms that these are the datasets utilized for their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

2. For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248â€“255. IEEE, 2009.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
