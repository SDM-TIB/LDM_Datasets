To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Unified System for Aggression Identification in English Code-Mixed and Uni-Lingual Texts" by Anant Khandelwal and Niraj Kumar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their system on the **English Code-Mixed TRAC 2018 dataset** and a **uni-lingual English dataset obtained from Kaggle**. This suggests that these two datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant mentions in the **experiments** section. In the paper, the authors describe the datasets in **section 4.1 (Dataset Description)**. Here, they provide details about the two datasets used:

1. **TRAC 2018 Dataset**: This dataset is specifically for aggression identification and contains three labels: Overtly Aggressive (OAG), Covertly Aggressive (CAG), and Non-Aggressive (NAG). The dataset is used for training and testing the proposed models.

2. **Kaggle Dataset**: This dataset consists of 20,001 tweets that are manually labeled as either Aggressive (AGG) or Non-Aggressive (NAG). The authors mention that they used the same test split available in the baseline code.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **TRAC 2018 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ritesh Kumar, Guggilla Bhanodai, Rajendra Pamula, and Maheshwar Reddy Chennuru. *Trac-1 shared task on aggression identification: IIT (ISM) @ COLING‘18*. In Proceedings of the First Workshop on Trolling, Aggression and Cyberbullying (TRAC-2018), 58–65, 2018.

- For the **Kaggle Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alisa Eidi. *Dataset for Detection of CyberTrolls*. Kaggle, 2018. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/dataturks/dataset-for-detection-of-cybertrolls.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are captured for future reference or processing.
