To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Expressive Speaking Style from Text in End-to-End Speech Synthesis" by Daisy Stanton, Yuxuan Wang, and RJ Skerry-Ryan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their system on a dataset of expressive speech, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. In **section 4.1 (Single Speaker Experiments)**, they mention that their single-speaker TP-GST model is trained on **147 hours of American English audiobook data** read by a specific speaker, Catherine Byers. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used.

In **section 4.2 (Multiple Speaker Experiments)**, the authors state that they used **190 hours of American English speech** from **22 different female speakers**, which includes both expressive and non-expressive speech. They specify that this dataset consists of **147 hours of expressive audiobook data** and **21 high-quality proprietary datasets**.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**. The paper does not provide specific citations for the proprietary datasets or the audiobook data, but I can note the relevant details:

1. **Single-Speaker Dataset**: 
   - **Dataset Name**: American English Audiobook Data
   - **Details**: 147 hours of expressive speech read by Catherine Byers.

2. **Multi-Speaker Dataset**: 
   - **Dataset Name**: Multi-Speaker American English Speech
   - **Details**: 190 hours of speech from 22 different female speakers, including expressive and non-expressive speech.

Since the authors do not provide specific citations for these datasets, I will note that they are proprietary and do not have publicly available citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring to include the relevant details about each dataset as extracted from the paper.
