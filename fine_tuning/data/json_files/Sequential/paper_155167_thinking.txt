To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How much do language models copy from their training data? Evaluating linguistic novelty in text generation using RAVEN" by R. Thomas McCoy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, which typically contains detailed information about the experiments conducted, including any datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention using **Wikitext-103** and **WebText** as the datasets for training and evaluating the language models. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For **Wikitext-103**, the citation is:
> Merity, S., Xiong, C., Bradbury, J., & Socher, R. (2017). Pointer sentinel mixture models. In International Conference on Learning Representations.

For **WebText**, the citation is:
> Radford, A., Wu, J., Child, R., Luan, D., Amodei, D., & Sutskever, I. (2019). Language models are unsupervised multitask learners. OpenAI Blog.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the datasets are clearly documented and can be referenced appropriately in future work.

Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset entries.
