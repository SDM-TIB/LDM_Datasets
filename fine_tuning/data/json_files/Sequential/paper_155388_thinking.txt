To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Path Development Network with Finite-Dimensional Lie Group Representation" by Hang Lou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that "numerical experiments demonstrate that the path development consistently and significantly outperforms... on several empirical datasets." This indicates that there are datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

In **Section 4.1 (Speech Command dataset)**, the authors describe the dataset as consisting of 34,975 samples of audio recordings, represented in a regularly spaced time series of length 169 and path dimension 20. This is a clear identification of a dataset used in their experiments.

In **Section 4.2 (Character Trajectories dataset)**, the authors mention using the Character Trajectories dataset from the UEA time series classification archive, which consists of 2,858 time series with a constant length of 182 and 20 unique characters to classify. This is another dataset that needs to be documented.

In **Section 4.3 (N-body simulations)**, the authors describe a simulated dataset of 5 charged particles, which is used for a regression task predicting future locations based on past trajectories. While this dataset is simulated, it is still important to note as it is part of their experimental setup.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **Speech Command dataset**, the citation is:
   > Warden, P. (2018). Speech commands: A dataset for limited-vocabulary speech recognition. arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.03209.

2. For the **Character Trajectories dataset**, the citation is:
   > Bagnall, A., Dau, H. A., Lines, J., Flynn, M., Large, J., Bostrom, A., Southam, P., & Keogh, E. (2018). The UEA multivariate time series classification archive. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.00075.

3. The **N-body simulation dataset** is simulated and does not have a formal citation, but I will note that it is based on the work by Kipf et al. (2018):
   > Kipf, T., Fetaya, E., Wang, K.-C., Welling, M., & Zemel, R. (2018). Neural relational inference for interacting systems. In International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation for future reference or processing.
