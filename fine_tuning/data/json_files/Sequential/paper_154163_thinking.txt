To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Controllable neural text-to-speech synthesis using intuitive prosodic features" by Tuomo Raitio et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction discusses the need for a large amount of speech data for training neural TTS systems, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In **section 3.1 (Data)**, the authors mention using an internal **36-hour dataset of an American English female voice** and a **16-hour conversational expressive dataset** from the same speaker. This indicates that there are two datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are internal and specific to the authors' work, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. Therefore, I will document them as follows:

1. **36-hour dataset**: This dataset is described as an internal dataset of an American English female voice, produced in a professional studio and post-processed for high quality. Since it is internal, it does not have a formal citation.

2. **16-hour conversational expressive dataset**: This dataset is also internal and comes from the same speaker as the 36-hour dataset. Like the first dataset, it does not have a formal citation.

Since both datasets are internal and do not have publicly available citations, I will note that in the dataset descriptions.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant details and the lack of formal citations for these internal datasets. This will provide a clear understanding of the datasets used in the research without needing a specific JSON structure.
