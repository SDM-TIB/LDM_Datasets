To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rolling-Unrolling LSTMs for Action Anticipation from First-Person Video" by Antonino Furnari and Giovanni Maria Farinella, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method is validated on **EPIC-Kitchens, EGTEA Gaze+, and ActivityNet**, indicating that these are the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find:

1. **EPIC-Kitchens**: This dataset contains 39,596 action annotations, 125 verbs, and 352 nouns. The authors mention that they split the public training set into training and validation sets, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's structure.

2. **EGTEA Gaze+**: This dataset includes 10,325 action annotations, 19 verbs, 51 nouns, and 106 unique actions. The authors note that methods are evaluated on this dataset using three provided splits.

3. **ActivityNet**: This dataset consists of 10,024 training videos, 4,926 validation videos, and 5,044 test videos, with each video labeled with one or more action segments belonging to 200 action classes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations I need to find are:

- For **EPIC-Kitchens**, the citation is:
  > Damen, D., Doughty, H., Farinella, G. M., Fidler, S., Furnari, A., Kazakos, E., Moltisanti, D., Munro, J., Perrett, T., Price, W., & Wray, M. (2018). *Scaling egocentric vision: The epic-kitchens dataset*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (pp. 720–736).

- For **EGTEA Gaze+**, the citation is:
  > Li, Y., Liu, M., & Rehg, J. M. (2018). *In the eye of beholder: Joint learning of gaze and actions in first person video*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (pp. 314–327).

- For **ActivityNet**, the citation is:
  > Caba Heilbron, F., Escorcia, V., Ghanem, B., & Niebles, J. C. (2015). *Activitynet: A large-scale video benchmark for human activity understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (pp. 961–970).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
