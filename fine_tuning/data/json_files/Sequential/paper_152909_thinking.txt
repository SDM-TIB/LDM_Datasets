To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Empirical Evaluation of Text Representation Schemes on Multilingual Social Web to Filter the Textual Aggression" by Sandip Modha and Prasenjit Majumder, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper evaluates text representation schemes on two tasks: User Aggression and Fact Detection, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **TRAC Dataset**: This dataset consists of 15,001 aggression-annotated Facebook posts and comments in both Hindi (Romanized and Devanagari script) and English. It is used for the User Aggression detection task.

2. **FIRE IRMiDis Dataset**: This dataset is part of the Information Retrieval from Microblogs during Disasters track and contains tweets collected during the Nepal earthquake in 2015. It is used for the Fact Detection task.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **TRAC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kumar, Ritesh, Reganti, Aishwarya N., Bhatia, Akshit, and Maheshwari, Tushar. "Aggression-annotated Corpus of Hindi-English Code-mixed Data." Proceedings of the 11th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC), Miyazaki, Japan, 2018.

- For the **FIRE IRMiDis Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Basu, Moumita, Ghosh, Saptarshi, and Ghosh, Kripabandhu. "Overview of the FIRE 2018 track: Information Retrieval from Microblogs during Disasters (IRMiDis)." Proceedings of FIRE 2018 - Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation, Gujrat, India, December 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
