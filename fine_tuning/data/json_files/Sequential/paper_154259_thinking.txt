To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding Neural Abstractive Summarization Models via Uncertainty" by Jiacheng Xu, Shrey Desai, and Greg Durrett, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors analyze two strong pretrained models on two summarization datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors reference two summarization datasets: **CNN/Daily Mail** and **XSum**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are central to their experiments.

I will then check the **model and experimental setup** section for further details about these datasets. The authors confirm that both PEGASUS and BART models are fine-tuned on the **CNN/Daily Mail** dataset and the **XSum** dataset. This reinforces the importance of these datasets in their analysis.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **CNN/Daily Mail** dataset, the citation is:
   > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomás Kociský, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching Machines to Read and Comprehend*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2015.

2. For the **XSum** dataset, the citation is:
   > Shashi Narayan, Shay B. Cohen, and Mirella Lapata. *Don’t Give Me the Details, Just the Summary! Topic-Aware Convolutional Neural Networks for Extreme Summarization*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2018.

Having gathered this information, I will now prepare to create entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
