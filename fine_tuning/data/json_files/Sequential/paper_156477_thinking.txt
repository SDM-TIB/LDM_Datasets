To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BS-PLCNET: Band-Split Packet Loss Concealment Network with Multi-Task Learning Framework and Multi-Discriminators" by Zihan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method but does not specify datasets. The introduction discusses the context of the research and mentions participation in the ICASSP 2024 PLC Challenge, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for training their model. Here, they mention using clean data from the **5th DNS Challenge**, which is crucial for simulating lossy signals. They also reference additional data from **LibriSpeech** and the **Interspeech 2022 PLC Challenge datasets**. This section is key as it explicitly lists the datasets utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets directly, but I can infer the following based on common knowledge:

1. **5th DNS Challenge**: The citation for this dataset is typically:
   > "5th Deep Noise Suppression Challenge." Available at: https://dns-challenge.com/

2. **LibriSpeech**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, W. P. G. Ng, and S. Khudanpur. *LibriSpeech: A Large-Scale Corpus for Speech Recognition*. In Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206-5210, 2015.

3. **Interspeech 2022 PLC Challenge**: The citation for this dataset is generally:
   > "Interspeech 2022 Packet Loss Concealment Challenge." Available at: https://interspeech2022.org/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as they are critical for proper attribution and reference.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
