To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Turn and Dialogue level User Satisfaction Estimation on Multi-Domain Conversations" by Praveen Kumar Bodigutla et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their model on dialogues sampled from 28 Alexa domains, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Data and Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they sampled **3,129 dialogue sessions** from two dialogue systems, which is a clear indication of the dataset's existence.

In this section, they provide additional details about the dialogues, including the number of turns and the domains involved. They specify that the dialogues span **28 domains** and are representative of end-user interactions with Alexa.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this paper, the authors do not provide a specific dataset citation for the dialogues sampled from the Alexa domains. Instead, they reference their previous works and related literature that may have used similar datasets.

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset, I will note that the dataset consists of dialogues from Alexa domains, but I cannot provide a full citation as it is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.

To summarize, the key dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **Dataset of Multi-Domain Dialogues**: This dataset consists of 3,129 dialogue sessions sampled from two dialogue systems across 28 domains, representing end-user interactions with Alexa.

While I cannot provide a formal citation for this dataset, I will acknowledge that it is derived from the authors' previous work and the context of Alexa's multi-domain capabilities.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
