To extract datasets from the research paper titled "H-AES: Towards Automated Essay Scoring for Hindi" by Shubhankar Singh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors use a "small-scale, real-world Hindi corpus" and a "machine-translated version of the ASAP corpus," which suggests that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will focus on the **corpora section** (Section 3), where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their study. Here, they mention:

1. **ASAP-Hindi Corpus**: This is a Hindi-translated version of the Automated Student Assessment Prize (ASAP) corpus. The authors note that this dataset has been widely used in AES research and contains various prompts for scoring essays.

2. **Organic Hindi Corpus**: This dataset consists of 126 real-world essays written by students on the prompt "The essence of Travel in one’s life." The authors describe the scoring methodology and the characteristics of the essays in detail.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the original datasets mentioned. The ASAP corpus is referenced as follows:

- For the **ASAP corpus**, the citation is:
  > Attali, Y., & Burstein, J. (2006). Automated Essay Scoring With e-rater® V.2. *The Journal of Technology, Learning and Assessment*, 4(3).

Since the authors created a translated version of this corpus, I will use the original citation for the ASAP corpus.

For the **Organic Hindi Corpus**, since it is a dataset created by the authors themselves, I will note that it does not have a formal citation but will describe it as part of the dataset entries.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the necessary details and citations for each dataset in the specified format.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **ASAP-Hindi Corpus** - Citation: Attali, Y., & Burstein, J. (2006). Automated Essay Scoring With e-rater® V.2. *The Journal of Technology, Learning and Assessment*, 4(3).
2. **Organic Hindi Corpus** - No formal citation, described as a dataset of 126 essays written by students.

With this information, I will prepare the final structured output for the datasets.
