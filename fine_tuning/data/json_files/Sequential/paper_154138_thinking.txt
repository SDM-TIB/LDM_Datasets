To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparative Evaluation of Pretrained Transfer Learning Models on Automatic Short Answer Grading" by Sasi Kiran Gaddipati et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **Mohler dataset** for evaluating the efficiency of various transfer learning models, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the Mohler dataset. They explain that it consists of questions and answers in the computer science domain, specifically designed for automatic short answer grading. The dataset includes 2,273 answers from 10 assignments and 2 examinations, graded by evaluators. This section provides essential details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Mohler dataset. The authors cite the original paper that introduced the dataset, which is crucial for proper attribution.

The citation for the Mohler dataset is:
> Mohler, M., Bunescu, R., & Mihalcea, R. (2011). Learning to grade short answer questions using semantic similarity measures and dependency graph alignments. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies-Volume 1, pages 752â€“762. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

In summary, the steps I followed include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction to identify the dataset.
2. Analyzing the dataset section for detailed information.
3. Retrieving the full citation from the references.

With this information, I can now create a comprehensive entry for the Mohler dataset.
