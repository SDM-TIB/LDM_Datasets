To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lempel-Ziv Networks" by Rebecca Saul et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the application of the Lempel-Ziv Network on various datasets, which indicates that there are datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, the authors mention two specific datasets:

1. **UCR Time Series Archive**: This is a well-known collection of 128 datasets for time series classification problems. The authors state that they trained their model on every dataset in this archive.

2. **PS-MNIST**: This dataset is a variant of the MNIST dataset where the pixels of the images are presented sequentially after applying a fixed permutation. The authors tested their model on this dataset as well.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **UCR Time Series Archive**, the citation is:
  > H. A. Dau, E. Keogh, K. Kamgar, C.-C. M. Yeh, Y. Zhu, S. Gharghabi, C. A. Ratanamahatana, Yanping, B. Hu, N. Begum, A. Bagnall, A. Mueen, G. Batista, and Hexagon-ML. "The UCR Time Series Classification Archive." October 2018. Available: https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data_2018/.

- For the **PS-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Q. V. Le, N. Jaitly, and G. E. Hinton. "A simple way to initialize recurrent networks of rectified linear units." arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.00941, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets and their citations, which is crucial for any subsequent analysis or reporting.
