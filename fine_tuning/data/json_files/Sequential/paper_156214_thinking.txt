To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Different Time-Series-Transformer (TST) Architectures: A Case Study in Battery Life Prediction for Electric Vehicles (EVs)" by Niranjan Sitapure and Atharva Kulkarni, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilized a dataset comprising **72 unique driving trips performed in a BMW i3 (60 Ah)**, which is a clear indication of a dataset being used.

Next, I will look for more details about this dataset in the **methodology section**. Here, the authors describe the dataset further, noting that it includes **environmental data, battery data, vehicle driving data, and heating circuit data** recorded every 0.1 seconds. This detailed description helps confirm the dataset's relevance and scope.

In the **results and discussion section**, the authors mention that they compiled data from **40+ trips** into a larger dataset with **4000 datapoints for training, 1000 datapoints for validation, and model testing**. This reinforces the significance of the dataset in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** for the full citation of the dataset. The authors reference a dataset related to their study, which is:

- **Battery and heating data in real driving cycles**:
  > Matthias Steinstraeter, Johannes Buberger, and Dimitar Trifonov. *Battery and heating data in real driving cycles*. 2020.

This citation provides the necessary details to credit the dataset appropriately.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation as required. The dataset entry will include the name, description, and citation, ready for structured output.

After completing these steps, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further use or analysis.
