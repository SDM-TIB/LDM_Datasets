To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FRSUM: Towards Faithful Abstractive Summarization via Enhancing Factual Robustness" by Wenhao Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on various datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiment Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe two datasets:

1. **CNN/DM**: This dataset consists of news articles and associated highlights, used for multi-sentence summarization. The authors mention that they used the standard splits for training, validation, and testing.

2. **XSum**: This dataset is designed for extreme summarization, requiring a one-sentence summary for each news document. The authors also provide details about the splits used for training, validation, and testing.

In this section, the authors provide specific details about the datasets, including their structure and the number of samples, which is crucial for understanding their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets:

- For **CNN/DM**, the citation is:
  > Hermann, K. M., Kocisky, T., Grefenstette, E., Espeholt, L., Kay, W., Suleyman, M., & Blunsom, P. (2015). Teaching machines to read and comprehend. *Advances in neural information processing systems*, 28:1693–1701.

- For **XSum**, the citation is:
  > Narayan, S., Cohen, S. B., & Lapata, M. (2018). Don’t give me the details, just the summary! Topic-aware convolutional neural networks for extreme summarization. In *Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing*, pages 1797–1807.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or analysis.
