To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning to Optimize Long-term User Engagement in Recommender Systems" by Lixin Zou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 6 (Experiments on Real-World E-Commerce Dataset)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention collecting user access logs from an e-commerce platform, which is a crucial dataset for their study.

In **section 6.1 (Dataset)**, the authors provide specific details about the dataset, including the number of trajectories, items, users, and various metrics related to user engagement. This section is essential for understanding the dataset's structure and significance.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. In this case, the authors refer to their own dataset collected from an e-commerce platform, so I will note that as the primary dataset used in their experiments.

The dataset extracted from the paper is as follows:

1. **E-commerce User Access Logs**: This dataset consists of 17 days of user access logs from July 2018, containing user IDs, timestamps, recommended item IDs, behavior policy scores, and user feedback. The statistics provided include:
   - Number of trajectories: 633,345
   - Number of items: 456,805
   - Number of users: 471,822
   - Average clicks: 2.04 (max: 99, min: 0)
   - Average dwell time: 2.4 minutes (max: 5.3, min: 0.5)
   - Average browsing depth: 13.34 (max: 149, min: 1)
   - Average return time: 5.18 days (max: 17, min: 0)

The citation for the dataset is:
> Lixin Zou, Long Xia, Zhuoye Ding, Jiaxing Song, Weidong Liu, and Dawei Yin. 2019. Reinforcement Learning to Optimize Long-term User Engagement in Recommender Systems. In The 25th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD ’19), August 4–8, 2019, Anchorage, AK, USA. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 9 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3292500.3330668

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I have accurately captured the dataset details and citations as required.
