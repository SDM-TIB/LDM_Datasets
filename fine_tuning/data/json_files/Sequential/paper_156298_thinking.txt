To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Temperature of Major Cities Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning" by Wasiou Jaharabia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a database from the University of Dayton, which suggests that this is a key dataset for their research.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically the subsection labeled **A. Dataset**. Here, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they utilized. They mention that they used the **Average Daily Temperature Archive** provided by the University of Dayton, which contains daily temperatures for 167 international cities and 157 U.S. cities from January 1, 1995, to May 2020. This dataset is crucial for their temperature prediction model.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- **Average Daily Temperature Archive**: 
  > Srk. Daily temperature of major cities. June 2020. URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/daily-temperature-of-major-cities.

This citation includes the author (Srk), the title of the dataset, the date of publication, and the URL where the dataset can be accessed.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will allow for easy reference and verification of the dataset used in the research.

In summary, I will extract the following dataset information:

1. **Dataset Name**: Average Daily Temperature Archive
   - **Description**: A dataset containing daily temperatures of 167 international cities and 157 U.S. cities from January 1, 1995, to May 2020.
   - **Citation**: Srk. Daily temperature of major cities. June 2020. URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/daily-temperature-of-major-cities.

After gathering this information, I will ensure it is formatted correctly for any further processing or documentation needs.
