To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long Short-Term Memory Based Recurrent Neural Network Architectures for Large Vocabulary Speech Recognition" by HasÂ¸im Sak et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, while the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

Upon reviewing Section 3.1, I find that the authors mention a dataset consisting of **3 million utterances (about 1900 hours)** of anonymized and hand-transcribed Google voice search and dictation traffic. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, so I will note it down.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. In this case, the authors do not provide a specific citation for the Google voice search dataset, as it is likely proprietary or internal to Google. However, I will still document the dataset as it is described in the paper.

Now, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Google Voice Search Dataset**: This dataset consists of 3 million utterances (about 1900 hours) of anonymized and hand-transcribed Google voice search and dictation traffic. It is used for training the LSTM models in the experiments.

Since there are no additional datasets mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format for clarity.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the details of the dataset, including its significance in the context of the research, and prepare to present this information in the required format for further processing or review.
