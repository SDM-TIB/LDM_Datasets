To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A multi-task learning model for malware classification with useful file access pattern from API call sequence" by Xin Wang and Siu Ming Yiu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, I notice that there is a table summarizing the dataset statistics, which indicates that the authors have used a public malware API call sequence dataset. Specifically, they mention using a dataset with 7430 samples for coarse-grained evaluation and 4932 samples for fine-grained evaluation.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites a dataset from Kim (2016) for the API call sequences. I will extract the full citation for this dataset.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Kim, H. K. (2016). *API call sequence dataset*. Retrieved from http://ocslab.hksecurity.net/apimds-dataset; accessed 11-August-2016.

Additionally, I will note that the paper discusses various families of malware and their characteristics, but it does not introduce new datasets beyond the one referenced.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference.

In summary, the key steps are:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for specific dataset details.
3. Retrieve full citations from the references section.
4. Compile the dataset information with proper citations for clarity and completeness.
