To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Stacked Bidirectional and Unidirectional LSTM Recurrent Neural Network for Forecasting Network-wide Traffic State with Missing Values" by Zhiyong Cui et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that two real-world network-wide traffic state datasets are used for testing models, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **LOOP-SEA Dataset**: This dataset is collected from inductive loop detectors on connected freeways in the Seattle area. It contains traffic speed data from 323 sensor stations over the entire year of 2015, with a time interval of 5 minutes, resulting in a total of 105,120 time steps. The dataset is published on GitHub.

2. **PEMS-BAY Dataset**: This dataset is collected by California Transportation Agencies and contains speed information from 325 sensor stations in the Bay Area, covering six months from January 1st, 2017, to June 30th, 2017, also with a 5-minute interval. This dataset is published on GitHub as well.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are:

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for further processing or review.
