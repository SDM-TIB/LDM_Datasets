To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discovering Invariances in Healthcare Neural Networks" by Mohammad Taha Bahadori and Layne C. Price, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the application of the proposed MIND framework to **clinical time series data** and **clinical notes**, indicating that these are the types of datasets used.

Next, in the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of analyzing healthcare models and mention the use of the **MIMIC-III dataset** for their experiments. This is a significant clue that I need to investigate further.

In the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4**, the authors explicitly state that they perform experiments on two types of healthcare data using the **MIMIC-III dataset**. They mention two specific tasks: predicting in-hospital mortality from multivariate clinical time series and predicting length of stay from clinical notes. 

I will now look for the full citation of the **MIMIC-III dataset** in the **references section**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Johnson, A. E., Pollard, T. J., Shen, L., Li-wei, H. L., Feng, M., Ghassemi, M., Moody, B., Szolovits, P., Celi, L. A., and Mark, R. G. MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database. *Scientific Data*, 3:160035, 2016.

Additionally, the authors reference other works related to the tasks they perform, such as the benchmark in-hospital mortality prediction task from multivariate clinical time series (Harutyunyan et al., 2019) and the use of BioBERT for clinical notes (Lee et al., 2019). However, the primary dataset they focus on is the MIMIC-III dataset.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **MIMIC-III Dataset**: This dataset is used for two tasks: predicting in-hospital mortality from clinical time series data and predicting length of stay from clinical notes.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations for clarity and completeness. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
