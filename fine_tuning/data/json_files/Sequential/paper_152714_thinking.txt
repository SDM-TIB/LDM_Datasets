To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SQuantizer: Simultaneous Learning for Both Sparse and Low-precision Neural Networks" by Mi Sun Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the application of the proposed method on various neural networks, but it does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions.

Upon reviewing Section 4, I find that the authors conducted experiments on the **ImageNet dataset** for image classification tasks and the **COCO dataset** for object detection tasks. These are significant datasets in the field of computer vision.

Now, I will gather the necessary details about these datasets:

1. **ImageNet Dataset**: This dataset is widely used for image classification tasks and contains over 1.2 million training images across 1,000 classes. It is a standard benchmark in the field.

2. **COCO Dataset**: The Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset is used for object detection and contains images with annotations for 80 classes. It is also a well-known benchmark in the computer vision community.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are typically provided in the references, and I will ensure to include them accurately.

- For the **ImageNet dataset**, the citation is:
  > O. Russakovsky et al. "ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge." *International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV)*, 115(3):211–252, 2015.

- For the **COCO dataset**, the citation is:
  > T.-Y. Lin et al. "Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context." In *European Conference on Computer Vision*, pages 740–755, 2014.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
