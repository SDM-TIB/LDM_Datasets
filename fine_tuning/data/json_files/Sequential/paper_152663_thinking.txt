To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compressing Recurrent Neural Networks with Tensor Ring for Action Recognition" by Yu Pan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on "real-world action recognition datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any explicit mentions of datasets. In the text, the authors clearly state that they evaluated their model on two datasets: **UCF11** and **HMDB51**. I will take note of these names and any relevant details provided about them.

In the **experiments on the UCF11 dataset** section, the authors describe UCF11 as containing 1600 video clips divided into 11 action categories. This gives me a good understanding of the dataset's structure and purpose.

Similarly, in the **experiments on the HMDB51 dataset** section, the authors mention that HMDB51 is composed of 6766 video clips from 51 action categories. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **UCF11**, the citation is:
  > Liu, J., Luo, J., and Shah, M. (2009). Recognizing realistic actions from videos “in the wild”. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1996–2003.

- For **HMDB51**, the citation is:
  > Kuehne, H., Jhuang, H., Garrote, E., Poggio, T. A., and Serre, T. (2011). HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2556–2563.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
