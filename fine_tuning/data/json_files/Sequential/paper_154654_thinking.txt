To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WHOSe Heritage: Classification of UNESCO World Heritage Statements of 'Outstanding Universal Value' with Soft Labels" by Nan Bai et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves a new dataset containing Statements of Outstanding Universal Value (OUV), which suggests that there is a dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data and Problem Statement)**, where the authors describe the data collection process. They mention that the dataset is derived from the UNESCO World Heritage Centre's openly released syndication dataset in XLS format, which includes information about inscribed World Heritage sites, including their justifications for OUV.

In this section, the authors specify that they used data from **1052 out of 1121 World Heritage sites** that contain justification data. They explain how they processed this data into a format suitable for training their models, indicating that this dataset is significant for their research.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details about the dataset. The appendix includes a table summarizing the selection criteria and the number of samples for each criterion, which provides further context about the dataset's structure.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset mentioned in the paper. The dataset is based on the UNESCO World Heritage Centre's dataset, which is publicly available. The citation for this dataset is as follows:

- **UNESCO World Heritage Centre**. *UNESCO World Heritage List*. Available at: http://whc.unesco.org/en/syndication. Accessed on [insert access date].

Finally, I will summarize the dataset details, including its purpose and the number of samples, ensuring that I have captured all relevant information for future reference.

In conclusion, I will create a structured output that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for further processing or review.
