To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Transductions and Alignments with RNN Seq2seq Models" by Zhengxiang Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but I will need to delve deeper into the sections that detail the experiments and datasets used.

In **section 4 (Experimental setups)**, the author describes the data used for the experiments. Specifically, in **section 4.1 (Data)**, the author outlines the datasets created for the four learning tasks: identity, reversal, total reduplication, and quadratic copying. The author mentions that the input alphabet consists of the 26 lowercase English letters and provides details about the number of input-target pairs for each task.

The datasets are as follows:

1. **Identity Dataset**: Contains input-target pairs for the identity function, where the output is the same as the input. The dataset includes 1,000 pairs for input lengths of 6-15 and 5,000 pairs for the test set.

2. **Reversal Dataset**: Similar structure to the identity dataset, but the output is the reverse of the input. It also includes 1,000 pairs for input lengths of 6-15 and 5,000 pairs for the test set.

3. **Total Reduplication Dataset**: This dataset contains pairs where the output is the input string repeated twice. It follows the same structure with 1,000 pairs for training and 5,000 for testing.

4. **Quadratic Copying Dataset**: This dataset involves pairs where the output is the input string repeated a number of times based on its length. It also has 1,000 training pairs and 5,000 testing pairs.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to these datasets. However, since these datasets are generated by the authors for the purpose of their experiments, they may not have external citations. Instead, I will note that the datasets are original contributions of the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the details about the datasets and their respective citations (or lack thereof) in a structured format.

After completing this process, I will have a comprehensive list of datasets extracted from the paper, ready for further analysis or processing.
