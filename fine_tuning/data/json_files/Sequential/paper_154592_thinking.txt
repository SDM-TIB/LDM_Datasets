To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LSTMs and Deep Residual Networks for Carbohydrate and Bolus Recommendations in Type 1 Diabetes Management" by Jeremy Beauchamp et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experimental evaluations using real patient data from the **OhioT1DM dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of managing blood glucose levels and mentions previous work, but it primarily reiterates the focus on the OhioT1DM dataset.

Moving on to **section 5 (Using the OhioT1DM Dataset for Recommendation Examples)**, I will find detailed information about the dataset. The authors describe the OhioT1DM dataset as containing data collected from 12 subjects with type 1 diabetes, partitioned into two subsets: **OhioT1DM 2018** and **OhioT1DM 2020**. This section provides specifics about the data collection process, including the types of data recorded (e.g., blood glucose levels, insulin dosages, carbohydrate intake).

In this section, I will note the following details about the dataset:

1. **OhioT1DM Dataset**: This dataset is crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper. It includes data from 12 subjects over 8 weeks, with time series data on blood glucose levels, meals, and insulin dosages.

2. **OhioT1DM 2018**: This subset contains data from 6 patients and was used for the 2018 Blood Glucose Level Prediction challenge.

3. **OhioT1DM 2020**: This subset contains data from 6 additional patients and was used for the 2020 Blood Glucose Level Prediction challenge.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the OhioT1DM dataset. The authors reference the dataset in the following manner:

- For the OhioT1DM dataset, the citation is:
  > Marling, C.; Bunescu, R. The OhioT1DM dataset for blood glucose level prediction. Proceedings of the 5th International Workshop on Knowledge Discovery in Healthcare Data, 2020. Available at http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2675/paper11.pdf.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and completeness. The key dataset extracted is the OhioT1DM dataset, along with its two subsets and the corresponding citations.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and ready for further processing or review.
