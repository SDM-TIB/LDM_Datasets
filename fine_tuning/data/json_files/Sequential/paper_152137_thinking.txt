To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Context-Aware Trajectory Prediction" by Bartoli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their model on a public pedestrian dataset and contribute a new dataset collected in a crowded space. This indicates that there are at least two datasets to look for.

Next, I will move to the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **UCY Dataset**: This dataset consists of three sequences (ZARA-01, ZARA-02, and University) acquired in different scenarios. The authors note that they annotated the ZARA sequences with points in the scene to account for human-space interactions.

2. **MuseumVisits Dataset**: This is the new dataset introduced by the authors, collected in a big art museum using multiple cameras. It includes trajectories for 57 distinct persons, along with metadata about group affiliations and artworks observed.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **UCY Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alon Lerner, Yiorgos Chrysanthou, and Dani Lischinski. *Crowds by example*. Computer Graphics Forum, 26(3):655â€“664, 2007.

- For the **MuseumVisits Dataset**, since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:
  > Federico Bartoli, Giuseppe Lisanti, Lamberto Ballan, and Alberto Del Bimbo. *Context-Aware Trajectory Prediction in Crowded Spaces*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or integration into a larger dataset repository.
