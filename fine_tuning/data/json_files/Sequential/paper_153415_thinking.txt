To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recognizing Long-Form Speech Using Streaming End-to-End Models" by Arun Narayanan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions the evaluation of techniques on various test sets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training and testing. In this section, they mention several training sets from different domains, including:

1. **Voice-search domain**: This includes anonymized and hand-transcribed utterances representative of voice-search and far-field use cases.
2. **Telephony domain**: Segmented telephony speech is used for training.
3. **YouTube domain**: Semi-supervised YouTube video segments are included in the training data.

The paper also discusses the evaluation datasets, which include:

1. **TTS-Audiobook test set**: Created by synthesizing passages from a novel using a text-to-speech system.
2. **Call-center test set**: An unsegmented dataset containing longer utterances, acoustically similar to the telephony training set.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The authors reference various works that may provide the necessary details for the datasets mentioned. 

For example, the YouTube dataset is referenced in:
> H. Liao, E. McDermott, and A. Senior. *Large Scale Deep Neural Network Acoustic Modeling with Semi-supervised Training Data for YouTube Video Transcription*. In Proceedings of ASRU, IEEE, 2013.

The TTS-Audiobook dataset is based on:
> J. A. Altsheler. *The Last of the Chiefs: A Story of the Great Sioux War*. Grosset & Dunlap, 1909.

The call-center dataset is not explicitly cited in the references, but it is described as being similar to the telephony training set.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
