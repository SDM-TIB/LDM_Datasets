To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting the Insiderâ€™s Threat with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks" by Eduardo Lopez and Kamran Sartipi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses a "very large, anonymized dataset," which suggests that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Approach)**, particularly the subsection **B (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention the **Los Alamos National Laboratory dataset**, which is a significant dataset for their experiments. They provide specific details about the dataset, including its size and the nature of the data collected.

In this section, the authors explain that the dataset is an anonymized, multi-device log captured over 58 days, containing over 1.6 billion records from more than 12,000 users and 17,000 devices. They specifically mention that they focus on the authentications log, which contains more than 1 billion records.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- **Los Alamos National Laboratory Dataset**:
  > Alexander D. Kent. *Comprehensive, Multi-Source Cyber-Security Events*. Available at: https://csr.lanl.gov/data/cyber1/, 2015.

This citation provides the necessary details to credit the dataset properly.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will allow for clear documentation of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
