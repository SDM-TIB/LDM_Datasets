To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ConQueR: Query Contrast Voxel-DETR for 3D Object Detection" by Benjin Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the **Waymo Open Dataset (WOD)**, which indicates that this dataset is likely to be one of the primary datasets used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, the authors explicitly mention that their method is evaluated on the **Waymo Open Dataset**. I will look for any additional datasets mentioned in the context of experiments or comparisons.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the **Waymo Open Dataset** is the only dataset explicitly referenced for the experiments. I will now gather the full citation for this dataset from the **References section** of the paper.

The citation for the **Waymo Open Dataset** is:
> Pei Sun, Henrik Kretzschmar, Xerxes Dotiwalla, Aurelien Chouard, Vijaysai Patnaik, Paul Tsui, James Guo, Yin Zhou, Yuning Chai, Benjamin Caine, et al. *Scalability in perception for autonomous driving: Waymo open dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the steps I took to extract the dataset were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify potential datasets.
2. Review the experiments section for explicit mentions of datasets.
3. Locate the full citation for the identified dataset in the references.

The only dataset extracted from this paper is the **Waymo Open Dataset**, with the citation provided above.
