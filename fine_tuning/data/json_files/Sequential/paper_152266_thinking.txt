To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stance Detection with Bidirectional Conditional Encoding" by Isabelle Augenstein et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their approach on the **SemEval 2016 Task 6 Twitter Stance Detection corpus**, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly the **Methods** and **Experiments** sections. In the **Methods** section, the authors describe the task setup and mention the **SemEval 2016 Task 6 corpus** as the primary dataset for their experiments. They also refer to two subtasks: Task A and Task B, with Task B focusing on stance detection for unseen targets.

In the **Experiments** section, the authors provide a table (Table 1) that lists various corpora used in their experiments, including:

1. **TaskA Tr+Dv**: The official SemEval 2016 Twitter Stance Detection Task A training and development corpus.
2. **TaskA Tr+Dv HC**: A subset of Task A containing tweets specifically for the target Hillary Clinton.
3. **TaskB Unlab**: An unlabelled corpus containing tweets related to Donald Trump.
4. **TaskB Auto-lab**: An automatically labelled version of the Task B unlabelled corpus.
5. **Crawled Unlab**: A corpus collected for unsupervised pre-training.

I will now gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper. The relevant citation for the SemEval 2016 Task 6 corpus is:

- For the **SemEval 2016 Task 6 Twitter Stance Detection corpus**:
  > Saif M. Mohammad, Svetlana Kiritchenko, Parinaz Sobhani, Xiaodan Zhu, and Colin Cherry. *SemEval-2016 Task 6: Detecting stance in tweets*. In Proceedings of the International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, SemEval â€™16, San Diego, California, June 2016.

Next, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations as required.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **SemEval 2016 Task 6 Twitter Stance Detection corpus**: This dataset is used for stance detection tasks and includes various subtasks related to stance classification towards different targets.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary information is included for each dataset.
