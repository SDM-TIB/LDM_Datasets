To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Low-Shot Classification: A Comparison of Classical and Deep Transfer Machine Learning Approaches" by Peter Usherwood and Steven Smit, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper compares various approaches on low-shot text classification tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention that they sourced a range of publicly available datasets for classification tasks, specifically in the sentiment classification domain. The datasets are categorized into two domains: Amazon reviews and Twitter.

The authors detail five datasets:

1. **Amazon Movie Reviews (A1)**: This dataset is sourced from Leskovec & Krevl (2014) and consists of a large collection of movie reviews from Amazon, which are resampled to a three-point sentiment scale.

2. **Amazon Book Reviews (A2)**: This dataset is from He & McAuley (2016) and contains reviews of books, structured similarly to the Amazon Movie Reviews dataset.

3. **Amazon Health and Personal Care Product Reviews (A3)**: This dataset is similar in structure to A1 and A2 but focuses on health and beauty products.

4. **SemEval 2017 Subtask A (T1)**: This Twitter dataset is sourced from Rosenthal, Farra, & Nakov (2017) and comes pre-tagged into negative, positive, and neutral classes.

5. **SemEval 2017 Subtask CE (T2)**: Another dataset from SemEval 2017, which is also pre-split and contains product information.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Amazon Movie Reviews (A1)**:
  > Leskovec, J., & Krevl, A. (2014). *SNAP Datasets: Stanford large network dataset collection*. Retrieved from http://snap.stanford.edu/data.

- For **Amazon Book Reviews (A2)**:
  > He, R., & McAuley, J. (2016). *Ups and downs: Modeling the visual evolution of fashion trends with one-class collaborative filtering*. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web (pp. 507–517).

- For **Amazon Health and Personal Care Product Reviews (A3)**: The citation is similar to A2, as it is from the same source.

- For **SemEval 2017 Subtask A (T1)**:
  > Rosenthal, S., Farra, N., & Nakov, P. (2017). *SemEval-2017 Task 4: Sentiment analysis in Twitter*. In Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2017) (pp. 502–518).

- For **SemEval 2017 Subtask CE (T2)**: The citation is the same as T1.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
