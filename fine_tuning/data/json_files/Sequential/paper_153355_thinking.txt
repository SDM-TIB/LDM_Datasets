To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gated Recurrent Fusion to Learn Driving Behavior from Temporal Multimodal Data" by Athma Narayanan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors report results on the **Honda Driving Dataset (HDD)** and the **TORCS dataset**, which suggests that these datasets are central to their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, they describe the **Honda Driving Dataset (HDD)**, which includes 104 hours of synchronized multi-sensor naturalistic driving data, and the **TORCS dataset**, which is a driving simulator dataset that includes various sensing modalities.

For the **Honda Driving Dataset (HDD)**, the authors mention that it is used for tactical driver behavior classification, detailing the number of sessions and the types of data included (video and CAN signals). They also provide specifics about the data structure and the classification task.

For the **TORCS dataset**, the authors describe how it simulates vehicle dynamics and includes multiple sensing modalities such as odometry, LiDAR, and color images. They explain how the dataset is structured for the steering angle regression task.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Honda Driving Dataset (HDD)**, the citation is:
   > V. Ramanishka, Y.-T. Chen, T. Misu, and K. Saenko. *Toward driving scene understanding: A dataset for learning driver behavior and causal reasoning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 7699–7707, 2018.

2. For the **TORCS dataset**, the citation is:
   > B. Wymann, E. Espié, C. Guionneau, C. Dimitrakakis, R. Coulom, and A. Sumner. *Torcs, the open racing car simulator*. Software available at http://torcs.sourceforge.net, 2000.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for structured output or further processing.
