To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tikhonov Regularization for Long Short-Term Memory Networks" by Andrei Turkin, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and conclusion** sections to see if any datasets are referenced. The abstract discusses the derivation of a Tikhonov regularizer for LSTM networks but does not mention any specific datasets. The introduction also focuses on the theoretical aspects of LSTM networks and regularization techniques without citing any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** (if available) for any practical applications or evaluations that might involve datasets. However, in this paper, the focus is primarily on theoretical derivations and does not include empirical experiments or evaluations that typically utilize datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets used for experiments or evaluations, I will check the **References section** for any citations that might refer to datasets indirectly. The references primarily consist of foundational papers on LSTM and regularization techniques, but they do not provide specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that there are no datasets explicitly mentioned or utilized in the research. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were identified in the paper "Tikhonov Regularization for Long Short-Term Memory Networks" by Andrei Turkin, and thus, there are no citations to provide.
