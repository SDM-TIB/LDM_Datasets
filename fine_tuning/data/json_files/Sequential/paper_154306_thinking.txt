To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Approximating Aggregated SQL Queries With LSTM Networks" by Nir Regev et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluated their method using **twelve datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** (Section IV) where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention that they applied their method on **twelve unique datasets**, both proprietary and open source. I will look for a table or a list that details these datasets, as it is likely to contain important information about each dataset.

Upon reviewing **Table III** in Section IV, I find the following datasets listed:

1. **average_revenue**: This dataset is proprietary and has a target function of average revenue with 3 nominal attributes, 2 continuous attributes, and a total of 100,000,000 rows.

2. **average_success_rate**: Another proprietary dataset with a target function of average success rate, containing 1 nominal attribute, 1 continuous attribute, and 50,205,078 rows.

3. **count_product_pass**: This dataset is also proprietary, focusing on counting product passes, with 1 nominal attribute, 1 continuous attribute, and 6,293 rows.

4. **count_product_fail**: A proprietary dataset for counting product failures, with similar attributes as the previous dataset.

5. **count_product_false_calls**: This dataset counts false calls, with 1 nominal attribute, 1 continuous attribute, and 404,000 rows.

6. **count_churn_customers**: A proprietary dataset that counts churned customers, with 3 nominal attributes, 2 continuous attributes, and 2,233,293 rows.

7. **sum_duration_call**: This dataset sums the duration of calls, with 5 nominal attributes, 5 continuous attributes, and 415,791 rows.

8. **average_ibm_price**: A proprietary dataset focusing on the average price of IBM products, with 2 nominal attributes, 3 continuous attributes, and 2,264 rows.

9. **average_realestate_price**: This dataset averages real estate prices, with 3 nominal attributes, 1 continuous attribute, and 5,421 rows.

10. **avg_stock_close_price**: A dataset for averaging stock closing prices, with 3 nominal attributes, 2 continuous attributes, and 19,196 rows.

11. **average_paid_days**: This dataset averages the number of paid days, with 3 nominal attributes, 1 continuous attribute, and 4,000,000 rows.

12. **average_build_duration**: A dataset that averages build durations, with 2 nominal attributes, 2 continuous attributes, and 811,928 rows.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are proprietary and specific to the study, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note that the datasets are described in the paper and are available through the authors' GitHub repository mentioned in the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant details such as dataset names, characteristics, and any available citations or references to the authors' repository.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or processing.
