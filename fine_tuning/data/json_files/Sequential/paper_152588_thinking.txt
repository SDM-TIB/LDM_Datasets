To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sentence Segmentation for Classical Chinese Based on LSTM with Radical Embedding" by Han Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the dataset includes over 150 classical Chinese books from three different dynasties, which suggests that there is a specific dataset being utilized.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Data set)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they mention that they obtained 150 ancient texts, specifying the total number of characters and vocabulary size. They also categorize the texts according to dynasties and literary styles, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

In this section, the authors refer to the dataset as being derived from the **Chinese Biographical Database Project**. This is a significant detail, as it provides a source for the dataset. I will need to ensure I capture this reference accurately.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the Chinese Biographical Database Project. The citation provided in the paper is:

> Harvard University, Academia Sinica, Peking University. *China Biographical Database (CBDB)*. 2018. https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/cbdb

This citation will be essential for documenting the dataset properly.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Classical Chinese Texts Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset comprising 150 ancient texts from three different dynasties, totaling 44,083,978 characters and a vocabulary size of 20,285. The texts are categorized by dynasty and literary style.
   - **Citation**: Harvard University, Academia Sinica, Peking University. *China Biographical Database (CBDB)*. 2018. https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/cbdb

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that the citation is complete and accurately reflects the source of the dataset.
