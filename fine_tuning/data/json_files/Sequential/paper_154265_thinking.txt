To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recurrent convolutional neural network for the surrogate modeling of subsurface flow simulation" by Hyung Jun Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a deep neural network for surrogate modeling, which suggests that datasets may be involved, particularly in the context of numerical simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets or data generation methods. The introduction discusses the challenges of uncertainty in fluid flow modeling, but I need to find explicit references to datasets.

In the **problem statement section**, the authors describe the dataset used for their analysis. They mention a two-dimensional incompressible oil and water flow problem and state that the input data consists of permeability distributions generated by sequential Gaussian simulation. The outputs are water saturation and pressure distributions for 30 time steps during 300 days. They also mention generating 4,000 sets of data for training.

I will then look for any additional details in the **technical approach and results sections** to confirm the dataset's characteristics and usage. The authors provide a table (Table 1) that summarizes the dataset information, including parameters such as domain size, time, porosity, and output dimensions.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is generated from a commercial reservoir simulator (ECLIPSE), I will note that the dataset does not have a traditional citation like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will mention the simulator as the source of the data.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Simulated Subsurface Flow Dataset
   - **Description**: This dataset consists of 4,000 sets of data generated for a two-dimensional incompressible oil and water flow problem using the ECLIPSE simulator. The input is a permeability distribution, and the outputs are water saturation and pressure distributions over 30 time steps.
   - **Source**: ECLIPSE reservoir simulator (commercial software).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ensure that the citation for the simulator is included in the final output.
