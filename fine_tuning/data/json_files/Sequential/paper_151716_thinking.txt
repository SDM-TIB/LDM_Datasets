To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Like a Baby: Visually Situated Neural Language Acquisition" by Alexander G. Ororbia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a multi-modal neural architecture and the use of an image-captioning dataset, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments using the **MS-COCO image-captioning dataset**. This dataset is crucial for their study as it provides the visual context needed for training their models.

In section 4.1, the authors describe how they utilized the MS-COCO dataset, noting that each image has five captions provided by human annotators. They also mention that they translated these captions into German and Spanish, creating a multilingual corpus. This indicates that the dataset is not only used in its original form but also adapted for multilingual experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the MS-COCO dataset. The citation is typically found in the references, and I will ensure to include it accurately.

The citation for the MS-COCO dataset is:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740â€“755, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and its citation. The dataset entry will include the name of the dataset, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that all details are accurate and complete.
