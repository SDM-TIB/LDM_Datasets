To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting Operation Importance for Differentiable Neural Architecture Search" by Xukai Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the experiments were conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, which indicates that these datasets are likely to be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look at **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I find that the authors explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, equally distributed across 10 classes, with a fixed resolution of 32x32 pixels.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, but it is distributed across 100 classes.

3. **ImageNet**: Specifically, the authors refer to the ILSVRC2012 subset of ImageNet, which includes 1.28 million training images and 50,000 validation images across 1,000 object categories.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, CiteSeer, 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *ImageNet large scale visual recognition challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations as required.
