To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Crossfusor: A Cross-Attention Transformer Enhanced Conditional Diffusion Model for Car-Following Trajectory Prediction" by Junwei You et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights that the experimental results are based on the **NGSIM dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for the study.

Next, I will look closely at the **experiments section** where the authors provide details about the dataset used. In this section, they describe the **NGSIM dataset** as a rich repository of vehicle trajectory information, documenting traffic patterns along specific highways in California. They mention that the dataset includes overhead camera recordings sampled at 10 Hz, which is essential for understanding the context of the data.

The authors specify that they selected **1,606 three-vehicle platoon trajectory data**, totaling **4,818 individual trajectories**, and that each trajectory has a length of **200 frames**. This detailed description confirms the dataset's relevance and provides insight into its structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the NGSIM dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Colyar, J., & Halkias, J. (2007). *US Highway 101 Dataset*. Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Tech. Rep. FHWA-HRT-07-030, pp. 27â€“69.

Since the NGSIM dataset is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about it.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry according to the required format, ensuring that the full citation is included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
