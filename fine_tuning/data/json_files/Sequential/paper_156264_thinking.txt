To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discrete Denoising Diffusion Approach to Integer Factorization" by KÂ¯arlis Freivalds et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction discusses the problem of integer factorization and the approach taken, but again, no datasets are referenced.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section** where the authors describe their experimental setup. In this section, they mention generating a dataset of **10 million examples** for training, which consists of pairs of random integers and their products. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset, nor do they reference any publicly available datasets.

I will also check the **results section** to see if any additional datasets are mentioned. The authors discuss their testing methodology, which involves a test set of **1,000 examples** that were specifically created to ensure that none of the factors used in the training set were included. Again, no formal dataset names are provided.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited in relation to previous works. However, the references primarily consist of papers discussing algorithms and methodologies rather than datasets.

Since the paper does not provide specific names or citations for any datasets, I will note that the authors created their own datasets for the purpose of their experiments. The training dataset consists of 10 million examples generated from random integers, and the test dataset consists of 1,000 examples.

In summary, while I can document the existence of datasets used in the research, I cannot provide full citations as they are not specified in the paper. The datasets are:

1. **Training Dataset**: 10 million examples of integer pairs and their products (no formal citation).
2. **Test Dataset**: 1,000 examples of composite numbers with two prime factors (no formal citation).

I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity, but I must emphasize that the lack of formal dataset names and citations limits the completeness of the extraction.
