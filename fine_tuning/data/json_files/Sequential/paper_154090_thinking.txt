To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exact, Parallelizable Dynamic Time Warping Alignment with Linear Memory" by Christopher J. Tralie and Elizabeth Dempsey, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a divide and conquer algorithm to benchmark alignment accuracy on a collection of orchestral music, indicating that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors describe their dataset. They mention creating a dataset with **100 pairs of orchestral pieces**, which is crucial information. I will look for more details about this dataset, such as how it was constructed, the specific pieces included, and any relevant characteristics.

In **Section 4.1 (Features)**, the authors describe the features used for computing distances for synchronization, but they do not provide additional datasets. However, they mention that the dataset consists of pairs of orchestral pieces performed under different conductors, which is important for understanding the dataset's context.

I will also check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the dataset. However, it appears that the dataset is original to this study and does not have a separate citation. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is not formally published elsewhere.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset's name, description, and any relevant details, while also providing a citation for the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the paper is:
> Christopher J. Tralie and Elizabeth Dempsey. *Exact, Parallelizable Dynamic Time Warping Alignment with Linear Memory*. August 7, 2020.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset entry, ensuring that it is clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
