To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Two-Stream Network for Violence Detection Using Separable Convolutional LSTM" by Zahidul Islam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluated their method on three standard public datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names in the following sections.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments and Result Analyses)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe three datasets:

1. **RWF-2000 Dataset**: This dataset is highlighted as the largest dataset for violence detection, containing 2000 real-life surveillance footage clips, each lasting 5 seconds.

2. **Hockey Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1000 videos collected from various ice hockey footage, with each video containing 50 frames.

3. **Movies Dataset**: A smaller dataset with 200 video clips, which includes various resolutions and content, specifically focusing on violent scenes from different movies.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **RWF-2000 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cheng, M., Cai, K., & Li, M. (2019). RWF-2000: An open large scale video database for violence detection. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.05913*.

- For **Hockey Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nievas, E. B., Suarez, O. D., Garcia, G. B., & Sukthankar, R. (2011). Violence detection in video using computer vision techniques. In *International conference on Computer analysis of images and patterns*. Springer, pp. 332–339.

- For **Movies Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nievas, E. B., Suarez, O. D., Garcia, G. B., & Sukthankar, R. (2011). Violence detection in video using computer vision techniques. In *International conference on Computer analysis of images and patterns*. Springer, pp. 332–339. (Note: This dataset is often referenced alongside the Hockey dataset, and specific citation details may vary based on the source.)

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
