To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Synthesis of Neurons for Recurrent Neural Nets" by Roland Olsson, Chau Tran, and Lars Magnusson, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present experimental results for **eight datasets**, which suggests that I should look for specific names and details of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.3 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used in their experiments. This section is likely to contain the names, purposes, and characteristics of each dataset. I will carefully note down the relevant information for each dataset, including the number of examples, timesteps, inputs, and outputs.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **3W Dataset**: A predictive maintenance dataset from Petrobras, consisting of sensor values and events in oil wells. The task is to predict undesirable events.

2. **Crop Dataset**: Originally collected by Tan et al. (2017), this dataset classifies the type of crop based on time series images from the Sentinel-2A satellite.

3. **Double Pendulum Dataset**: Generated from a simulation using the SimBody physics engine, this dataset involves predicting the coordinates of a double pendulum.

4. **ECG5000 Dataset**: A 20-hour long ECG dataset originally published by Goldberger et al. (2000), which has been preprocessed for analysis.

5. **FordB Dataset**: Used in a competition at WCCI 2008, this dataset aims to determine issues in an internal combustion engine based on sound recordings.

6. **Insect Wingbeat Dataset**: Contains spectrograms of sounds generated by insect wings, with the goal of classifying insect species.

7. **LSST Dataset**: Simulated data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, used to measure brightness variations of astronomical objects.

8. **WISDM Dataset**: A dataset for predicting cell phone user activity based on accelerometer values, specifically version 1.1 without overlapping time windows.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or referenced correctly in future work.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
