To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-attention Networks for Temporal Localization of Video-level Labels" by Lijun Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss datasets** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in the **3rd YouTube-8M Video Understanding Challenge**, which suggests that datasets related to this challenge are likely to be discussed.

Next, I will focus on **section 1.1 (YouTube-8M Segment Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset they utilized. They explain that the YouTube-8M Segment Dataset is an extension of the original YouTube-8M Dataset, which contains human-verified segment-level labels. This section provides key details about the dataset, including the number of segments, categories, and the nature of the annotations.

The authors mention that the original YouTube-8M dataset contains **6 million video samples** and is split into training, validation, and test sets. They also specify that the segment dataset includes **237,000 segments** covering **1,000 categories**, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's scope.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

- For the **YouTube-8M Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sami Abu-El-Haija, Nisarg Kothari, Joonseok Lee, Paul Natsev, George Toderici, Balakrishnan Varadarajan, and Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan. *YouTube-8M: A Large-Scale Video Classification Benchmark*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.08675, 2016.

- For the **YouTube-8M Segment Dataset**, since it is an extension of the original dataset, I will reference the same citation as above, as it encompasses the segment-level annotations as well.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
