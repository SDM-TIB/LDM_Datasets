To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SECTOR: A Neural Model for Coherent Topic Segmentation and Classification" by Sebastian Arnold et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets being introduced. The abstract mentions the contribution of **WikiSection**, a dataset with 242k labeled sections in English and German, which indicates that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Task Overview and Dataset)**, where the authors describe the **WikiSection Dataset** in detail. Here, they provide specifics about the dataset, including the number of articles, the languages covered, and the structure of the dataset. They mention that it contains 38k articles from English and German Wikipedia, labeled with sections and topic labels.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide characteristics of the dataset, including the number of documents, average sentences per document, average sections per document, and the number of distinct headings and topics. This table confirms the dataset's size and structure.

Additionally, I will check the **experiments section** to see if any other datasets are mentioned. The authors refer to existing datasets for comparison, such as the **Wiki-727k dataset** and datasets introduced by Chen et al. (2009) for segmentation tasks. However, the primary dataset they focus on for their experiments is **WikiSection**.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **WikiSection Dataset**:
   - The citation for the WikiSection dataset is:
     > Arnold, S., Schneider, R., Cudré-Mauroux, P., Gers, F. A., & Löser, A. (2023). SECTOR: A Neural Model for Coherent Topic Segmentation and Classification. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [pages], [year]. Available at: https://github.com/sebastianarnold/WikiSection

2. **Wiki-727k Dataset**:
   - The citation for the Wiki-727k dataset is:
     > Koshorek, O., Cohen, A., Mor, N., Rotman, M., & Berant, J. (2018). Text segmentation as a supervised learning task. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 2 (Short Papers), pages 469–473.

3. **Cities and Elements Datasets**:
   - The citation for the Cities and Elements datasets is:
     > Chen, H., Branavan, S. R. K., Barzilay, R., & Karger, D. R. (2009). Global models of document structure using latent permutations. In Proceedings of Human Language Technologies: The 2009 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 371–379.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations as presented in the paper.
