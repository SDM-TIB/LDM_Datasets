To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Grey Models for Short-Term Queue Length Predictions for Adaptive Traffic Signal Control" by Gurcan Comert et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the study involves a case study using queue length data from five intersections with adaptive traffic signal control in Lexington, South Carolina. This indicates that there is a dataset related to queue lengths.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the **data description** section (4.1), the authors provide detailed information about the queue length data collected from 31 queue counters at five intersections. This section is crucial as it outlines the specifics of the dataset used in their analysis.

The dataset is described as follows:
- **Queue Length Data**: Collected from 31 queue counters at five signalized intersections in Lexington, South Carolina. The data includes average and maximum queue lengths collected per second over multiple simulation runs.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is derived from a case study conducted by the authors themselves, I will note that the citation for the dataset is essentially the paper itself, as it describes the methodology and data collection process.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Comert, G., Khan, Z., Rahman, M., & Chowdhury, M. (2020). Grey Models for Short-Term Queue Length Predictions for Adaptive Traffic Signal Control. *Expert Systems with Applications*. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset information and its citation into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their corresponding citations as required.
