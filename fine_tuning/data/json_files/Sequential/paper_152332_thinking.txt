To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conditional Random Fields as Recurrent Neural Networks" by Shuai Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors applied their method to the **Pascal VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark**, which indicates that this is a dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors explicitly state that they used the **Pascal VOC 2012 dataset** and the **Pascal Context dataset** for their evaluations. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics mentioned.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the **Pascal VOC 2012 dataset** as a standard dataset for evaluating semantic segmentation methods, consisting of 11,685 images. They also mention the **Pascal Context dataset**, which has a larger number of classes (59) and is used to assess performance on datasets with different characteristics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Pascal VOC 2012 dataset**, the citation is:
   > M. Everingham, S. A. Eslami, L. Van Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The Pascal Visual Object Classes Challenge: A Retrospective*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 111(1):98â€“136, 2015.

2. For the **Pascal Context dataset**, the citation is:
   > R. Mottaghi, X. Chen, X. Liu, N.-G. Cho, S.-W. Lee, S. Fidler, R. Urtasun, and A. Yuille. *The Role of Context for Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
