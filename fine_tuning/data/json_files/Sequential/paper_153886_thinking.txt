To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fostering Event Compression using Gated Surprise" by Dania Humaidan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context of the research and may reference specific datasets or experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**. I will carefully read through this section to identify any datasets that were utilized in their experiments. 

In **section 4.1 (Single Network Experiments)**, the authors mention using a time series that includes four functions representing different contexts or events. However, they do not explicitly name any external datasets. Instead, they describe the functions used in their experiments, which are:

1. **Addition function**: fadd(x, y) = 0.9x + y
2. **Sine function**: fsin(x, y) = x + sin(πy)
3. **Subtraction function**: fsub(x, y) = 0.9x − y
4. **Constant function**: fcon(x, y) = x

Since these functions are generated by the authors and not sourced from an external dataset, I will note that there are no publicly available datasets referenced in this paper.

After reviewing the **experiments section**, I will check the **References section** to ensure that I have captured any potential citations related to datasets. However, since the paper does not mention any external datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to cite.

In summary, I will document that the paper does not utilize any external datasets, and therefore, there are no citations to provide. This process highlights the importance of thoroughly reviewing each section of the paper to ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately.
