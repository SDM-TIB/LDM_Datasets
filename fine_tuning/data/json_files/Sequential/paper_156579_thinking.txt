To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LSTM-Based Text Generation: A Study on Historical Datasets" by Mustafa Abbas Hussein Hussein and Serkan Savaş, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study focuses on historical datasets for Shakespeare and Nietzsche, which suggests that these are the datasets I need to extract.

Next, I will examine the **Materials and Methods** section, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Shakespeare Dataset**: This dataset includes all of Shakespeare’s plays, organized for text analysis. It contains detailed location information for each line, identifies the specific play, and names the character speaking the line. The dataset is suitable for various NLP tasks, including studying Shakespeare’s writing style and training machine learning models.

2. **Nietzsche Texts Dataset**: This dataset is a comprehensive collection of English texts designed for NLP and text generation tasks. It is recommended for educational and experimental use, particularly with LSTM networks.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Shakespeare Dataset**:
  > LiamLarsen. (2017). *Shakespeare plays*. Kaggle - Shakespeare Plays. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kingburito666/shakespeare-plays/data

- For the **Nietzsche Texts Dataset**:
  > Kris. (2018). *Nietzsche Texts*. Kaggle - Nietzsche Texts. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pankrzysiu/nietzsche-texts

Now that I have the dataset names and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the study along with their proper references.
