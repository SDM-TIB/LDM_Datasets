To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Sequence-to-Sequence Models" by Yaser Keneshloo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, and the introduction often highlights key datasets used in the research.

Next, I will specifically look for a **dedicated section on datasets**. In this paper, there is a section labeled **"B. Datasets"** where the authors describe various datasets used in their experiments. This section is crucial as it typically contains detailed information about each dataset.

In the datasets section, I will note down the names and descriptions of each dataset mentioned. For example, the paper discusses several datasets such as:

1. **WMT’14 Dataset**: Used for machine translation, containing 850M words from English-French parallel corpora.
2. **CNN-Daily Mail Dataset**: Used for text summarization, containing around 287K news articles with summaries.
3. **Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD)**: A dataset for reading comprehension with over 100K question-answer pairs.
4. **OpenSubtitles Dataset**: Contains dialogues from movies, useful for dialogue generation tasks.

After identifying the datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For instance, I will look for citations like:

- For the **WMT’14 Dataset**, I will find the citation that details its origin and any relevant publication.
- For the **CNN-Daily Mail Dataset**, I will locate the citation that describes its creation and usage.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
