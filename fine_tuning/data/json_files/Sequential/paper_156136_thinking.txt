To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Federated Learning Based Distributed Localization of False Data Injection Attacks on Smart Grids" by Cihat KecÂ¸eci et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their proposed architecture through extensive simulations on the **IEEE 57, 118, and 300 bus systems** and real electricity load data. This suggests that these systems and the load data are key datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and dataset generation. They mention using the **IEEE 57, 118, and 300 bus systems** for modeling the power network structure and real hourly electricity load data provided by **ERCOT**. This confirms that these are the datasets utilized in their experiments.

In the **dataset generation subsection**, the authors detail how they generated the power load profiles and malicious data samples. They state that they generated **8752 data samples**, which were split into training and test datasets with an 80% - 20% ratio. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and usage.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **IEEE 57 Bus System**: The citation for this dataset is typically found in power system literature, but a common reference is:
   > "IEEE Power System Test Case Archive," available at: [IEEE PES](https://www.ee.washington.edu/research/pstca/).

2. **IEEE 118 Bus System**: Similar to the 57 bus system, this dataset is also part of the IEEE Power System Test Case Archive:
   > "IEEE Power System Test Case Archive," available at: [IEEE PES](https://www.ee.washington.edu/research/pstca/).

3. **IEEE 300 Bus System**: This dataset is also included in the IEEE Power System Test Case Archive:
   > "IEEE Power System Test Case Archive," available at: [IEEE PES](https://www.ee.washington.edu/research/pstca/).

4. **Real Electricity Load Data**: The authors mention that this data is provided by ERCOT. The citation for this dataset is:
   > ERCOT. "Hourly Load Data Archives." Available at: https://www.ercot.com/gridinfo/load/load_hist.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
