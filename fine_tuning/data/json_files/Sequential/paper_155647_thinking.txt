To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PINEAPPLE: Personifying INanimate Entities by Acquiring Parallel Personification Data for Learning Enhanced Generation" by Sedrick Scott Keh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors curated a corpus called **PersonifCorp**, which is a strong indication that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on the **Datasets section** (Section 2) to gather detailed information about the datasets mentioned. Here, the authors describe **PersonifCorp**, which consists of 511 personifications. They explain that this dataset is formed from two sources: 236 personifications from a publicly available list and 275 manually filtered examples from the **Deja dataset** (Chen et al., 2015). This section provides essential details about the dataset's composition and its significance in the research.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper. In this case, the authors reference the **Deja dataset**, which is crucial for understanding the origin of part of the PersonifCorp dataset. The Deja dataset is described as an image-captioning dataset with a subset of figurative captions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for both datasets:

1. For **PersonifCorp**, since it is a newly curated dataset, it does not have a formal citation yet. However, I will note that it is a significant contribution of this paper.

2. For the **Deja dataset**, the citation is:
   > Jianfu Chen, Polina Kuznetsova, David Warren, and Yejin Choi. *Déjà image-captions: A corpus of expressive descriptions in repetition*. In Proceedings of HLT-NAACL, pages 504–514, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **PersonifCorp**: A dataset of 511 personifications, combining examples from a publicly available list and the Deja dataset.
- **Deja dataset**: An image-captioning dataset that includes a figurative subset used to extract personifications.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets as required.
