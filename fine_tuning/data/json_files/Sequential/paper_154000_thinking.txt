To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive County Level COVID-19 Forecast Models: Analysis and Improvement" by Stewart W. Doe et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions the use of COVID-19 data and the adaptation of a model to forecast cases, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe the use of the **JHU confirmed cases data for US counties**, which is crucial for their analysis. This dataset is explicitly mentioned in the **Experimental Results** section, where they detail its characteristics, such as the time series of confirmed cases from January 22, 2020, to May 31, 2020.

I will also check the **references** section to find the full citation for the JHU dataset. The authors refer to the dataset as follows:

- **JHU COVID-19 Dataset**: 
  > Killeen, B. D., Wu, J. Y., Shah, K., Zapaishchykova, A., Nikutta, P., Tamhane, A., Chakraborty, S., Wei, J., Gao, T., Thies, M., & Unberath, M. (2020). A county-level dataset for informing the United Statesâ€™ response to COVID-19.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **JHU COVID-19 Dataset**: This dataset includes confirmed cases data for US counties, updated daily, providing a time series from January 22, 2020, to May 31, 2020, along with latitude and longitude information for each county.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the full citation for the dataset ready for inclusion in any structured output or documentation. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
