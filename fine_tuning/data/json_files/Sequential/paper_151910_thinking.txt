To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards social pattern characterization in egocentric photo-streams" by Maedeh Aghaei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a dataset acquired by 9 users, which indicates that there is a specific dataset being discussed. I will look for the name of this dataset and any details about it.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Experiments and discussion)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they introduce the **EgoSocialStyle dataset**, which consists of images captured by users wearing a Narrative Clip camera. The dataset is described as having been collected over a period of 100 days, with a total of 100,000 images, and includes various statistics about the interactions captured.

In this section, I will note the key details about the **EgoSocialStyle dataset**:
- It was acquired by 9 users.
- It contains 100,000 images.
- There are 3,000 social images and 62 different people.
- The dataset includes both training and test sets.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the **EGO-GROUP dataset** in section 7, which is used for validating their proposed model. I will gather details about this dataset as well.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for both datasets:

1. For the **EgoSocialStyle dataset**, the citation is:
   > Aghaei, M., Dimiccoli, M., Radeva, P. (2018). Towards social pattern characterization in egocentric photo-streams. *Computer Vision and Image Understanding*. 

2. For the **EGO-GROUP dataset**, the citation is:
   > Alletto, S., Serra, G., Calderara, S., Cucchiara, R. (2015). Understanding social relationships in egocentric vision. *Pattern Recognition*, 48, 4082-4096.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included for reference. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details from the paper.
