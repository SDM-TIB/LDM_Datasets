To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FastTrees: Parallel Latent Tree-Induction for Faster Sequence Encoding" by Bill Tuck Weng Pung and Alvin Chan, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed FASTTREES model achieves competitive performance on various sequence modeling tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets or benchmarks in these sections.

Next, I will carefully review the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for any explicit references to datasets, including their names and descriptions. The authors may also provide details about the tasks they performed using these datasets.

In the **experiments subsection** (4.1 to 4.6), I will identify the datasets used for each task. For example, the paper mentions the **Penn Treebank (PTB)** dataset for language modeling, the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2)** for sentiment analysis, and the **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI)** dataset for natural language inference. I will note down the specific details provided for each dataset, such as the number of samples, types of tasks, and any relevant characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For the datasets identified, I will compile the following citations:

1. **Penn Treebank (PTB)**:
   > Marcus, M. P., Santorini, B., & Marcinkiewicz, M. A. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313-330.

2. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2)**:
   > Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J., Chuang, J., Manning, C. D., Ng, A., & Potts, C. (2013). Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank. In *Proceedings of the 2013 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing* (pp. 1631-1642).

3. **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI)**:
   > Bowman, S. R., Angeli, S. R., Potts, C., & Manning, C. D. (2015). A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1508.05326*.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper. This will facilitate further exploration and understanding of the methodologies employed in the study.
