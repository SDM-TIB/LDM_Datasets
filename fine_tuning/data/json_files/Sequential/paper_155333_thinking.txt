To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lane Detection with Versatile AtrousFormer and Local Semantic Guidance" by Jiaxing Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved extensive results on three challenging benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **CULane**: This dataset consists of 55 hours of video clips and includes various road conditions. It has a total of 133,235 frames, with specific splits for training, validation, and testing.

2. **TuSimple**: This dataset is smaller, containing 6,408 frames, all shot under stable lighting conditions on highways. The authors provide details on how the frames are split for training, validation, and testing.

3. **BDD100K**: Originally designed for lane classification, this dataset has binary annotations for lane semantics and includes 80,000 training frames and 10,000 validation frames.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they utilized these three datasets for evaluating their proposed methods, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CULane**, the citation is:
  > Yu, F., Chen, H., Wang, X., Xian, W., Chen, Y., Liu, F., Madhavan, V., & Darrell, T. (2018). BDD100K: A diverse driving dataset for heterogeneous multitask learning. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.04687*.

- For **TuSimple**, the citation is:
  > TuSimple. (n.d.). TuSimple lane detection benchmark. Retrieved from https://github.com/TuSimple/tusimple-benchmark.

- For **BDD100K**, the citation is:
  > Yu, F., Chen, H., Wang, X., Xian, W., Chen, Y., Liu, F., Madhavan, V., & Darrell, T. (2018). BDD100K: A diverse driving dataset for heterogeneous multitask learning. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.04687*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
