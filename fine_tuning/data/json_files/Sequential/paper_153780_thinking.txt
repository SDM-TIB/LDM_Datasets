To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Forecast Network-Wide Traffic States for Multiple Steps Ahead: A Deep Learning Approach Considering Dynamic Non-Local Spatial Correlation and Non-Stationary Temporal Dependency" by Xinglei Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using **two publicly-available large-scale traffic datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **METR-LA Dataset**: This dataset contains traffic speed data from 207 sensors located on the highways of Los Angeles County, covering a period of four months (from March 1, 2012, to June 30, 2012). The data is aggregated into 5-minute intervals.

2. **PEMS-BAY Dataset**: This dataset includes traffic speed data from 325 sensors in the Bay Area, spanning six months (from January 1, 2017, to May 31, 2017), also aggregated into 5-minute intervals.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The authors cite the original work that introduced these datasets:

- For the **METR-LA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li, Y., Yu, R., Shahabi, C., Liu, Y. (2018). Diffusion convolutional recurrent neural network: Data-driven traffic forecasting. In: International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2018).

- For the **PEMS-BAY Dataset**, the citation is the same as above, as both datasets were released in the same paper.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This includes ensuring that I have the full citation for each dataset, which is crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
