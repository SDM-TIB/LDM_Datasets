To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Syntax Helps ELMo Understand Semantics: Is Syntax Still Relevant in a Deep Neural Architecture for SRL?" by Emma Strubell and Andrew McCallum, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of ELMo embeddings and mentions experiments on the **CoNLL-2005 shared task**, which suggests that this dataset is relevant.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (section 4), where the authors detail their experiments. In **section 4.1 (Data and pre-processing)**, they explicitly state that they evaluate their models on the **CoNLL-2005 semantic role labeling shared task** dataset. This dataset is derived from the WSJ portion of the Penn TreeBank corpus, which is a significant dataset in the field of natural language processing.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CoNLL-2005 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **CoNLL-2005**:
  > Xavier Carreras and Lluís M`arquez. *Introduction to the CoNLL-2005 shared task: Semantic role labeling*. In CoNLL, 2005.

Additionally, the paper mentions the **Brown corpus** as an out-of-domain test set derived from the CoNLL-2005 dataset. I will look for the citation for the Brown corpus as well, which is:

- For **Brown corpus**:
  > W. N. Francis and H. Kuˇcera. *Manual of information to accompany a standard corpus of present-day edited American English, for use with digital computers*. Technical report, Department of Linguistics, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, 1964.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The datasets identified are:

1. **CoNLL-2005**: A dataset for semantic role labeling derived from the WSJ portion of the Penn TreeBank corpus.
2. **Brown corpus**: An out-of-domain test set used in the experiments.

After gathering all necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each entry includes the full citation for proper referencing.
