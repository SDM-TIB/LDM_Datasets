To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Clarinet: A Music Retrieval System" by Kshitij Alwadhi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention that their system is tested and evaluated on the **Maestro Dataset**, which indicates that this is a key dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the dataset used for their experiments. They state that the **Maestro Dataset** consists of 1287 songs, which were originally recordings from the International Piano-e-Competition. This section confirms that the Maestro Dataset is the primary dataset utilized in their work.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Maestro Dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Curtis Hawthorne, Andriy Stasyuk, Adam Roberts, Ian Simon, Cheng-Zhi Anna Huang, Sander Dieleman, Erich Elsen, Jesse Engel, and Douglas Eck. *Enabling factorized piano music modeling and generation with the MAESTRO dataset*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2019.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude my extraction process here.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the Maestro Dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will be ready for any structured output or further processing needed.
