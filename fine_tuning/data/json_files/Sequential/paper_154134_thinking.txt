To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PNEL: Pointer Network based End-To-End Entity Linking over Knowledge Graphs" by Debayan Banerjee et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method over three datasets based on the Wikidata Knowledge Graph, which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they describe three datasets:

1. **WebQSP**: This dataset is adapted from the original WebQuestions dataset and contains 3,098 training and 1,639 test questions, covering 3,794 and 2,002 entities, respectively. The authors note that it includes a mixture of simple and complex questions.

2. **SimpleQuestions**: This dataset consists of over 30,000 training questions and nearly 10,000 test questions, specifically designed for simple questions. The entity IDs in this dataset were also converted from Freebase to Wikidata.

3. **LC-QuAD 2.0**: This dataset is based on Wikidata and includes 24,180 training questions and 6,046 test questions, covering 33,609 and 8,417 entities, respectively. It features a mix of simple and complex questions.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **WebQSP**, the citation is:
  > D. Sorokin and I. Gurevych. *Mixing Context Granularities for Improved Entity Linking on Question Answering Data across Entity Categories*. In Proceedings of the Seventh Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics, 2018.

- For **SimpleQuestions**, the citation is:
  > A. Bordes, N. Usunier, S. Chopra, and J. Weston. *Large-scale Simple Question Answering with Memory Networks*. 2015.

- For **LC-QuAD 2.0**, the citation is:
  > M. Dubey, D. Banerjee, A. Abdelkawi, and J. Lehmann. *Lc-quad 2.0: A large dataset for complex question answering over wikidata and dbpedia*. In The Semantic Web â€“ ISWC 2019. Springer International Publishing, 2019.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into the required format for further processing or review.
