To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On a novel training algorithm for sequence-to-sequence predictive recurrent networks" by Boris Rubinstein, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a novel memoryless algorithm for sequence prediction but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the author describes the numerical simulations. Here, the author mentions training networks on time series data generated from specific functions, namely the sine wave and trapezoid wave. This indicates that the datasets used are synthetic and generated based on these functions.

In **Section 5.1 (Traditional seq2seq network)**, the author describes how the training set is constructed from the sine wave and trapezoid wave functions. The training set consists of 4000 samples for each type of signal, which are generated from the functions Gs(t) and Gt(t). However, the paper does not provide formal dataset names or citations for these synthetic datasets, as they are derived from mathematical functions rather than established datasets.

Since the datasets are not formally published or cited in the references, I will note that the datasets are synthetic and based on the following functions:

1. **Sine Wave Dataset**: Generated from the function Gs(t) = aξ(t) + A0 + A sin(2πt/T), where specific parameters are defined in the paper.

2. **Trapezoid Wave Dataset**: Generated from the function Gt(t) = aξ(t) + A0 + trapezoidal function parameters, also defined in the paper.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any relevant citations for the methods used to generate these datasets. The references include works on sequence-to-sequence learning and noise filtering algorithms, but they do not specifically cite the synthetic datasets created for this study.

Since the datasets are not formally published, I will summarize them as follows:

- For the **Sine Wave Dataset**, I will note that it is based on the function described in the paper, but there is no formal citation.
- For the **Trapezoid Wave Dataset**, I will similarly note that it is based on the function described in the paper, with no formal citation.

Finally, I will compile the information about these datasets, ensuring to clarify that they are synthetic and derived from the mathematical functions presented in the paper, rather than established datasets with formal citations.

In summary, I will document the datasets as follows:

1. **Sine Wave Dataset**: Synthetic dataset generated from the function Gs(t) as described in the paper.
2. **Trapezoid Wave Dataset**: Synthetic dataset generated from the function Gt(t) as described in the paper.

Since there are no formal citations for these datasets, I will indicate that they are based on the author's own formulations and not published datasets.

This approach ensures that I accurately capture the essence of the datasets used in the research while adhering to the requirement for full citations, even if they are not formally available.
