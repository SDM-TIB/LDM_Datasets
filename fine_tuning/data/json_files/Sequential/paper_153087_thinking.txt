To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Fourier Perspective on Model Robustness in Computer Vision" by Dong Yin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of the **CIFAR-10-C** benchmark, which indicates that this dataset is relevant to the study. The introduction may provide additional context or mention other datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments with various data augmentation techniques and their effects on model robustness. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets referenced in relation to these experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors specifically mention the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10-C**: This dataset is referenced multiple times as a benchmark for evaluating the robustness of models under various corruptions. It is crucial to note that CIFAR-10-C is an extension of the CIFAR-10 dataset, which includes various corruptions applied to the images.

2. **ImageNet-C**: Similar to CIFAR-10-C, this dataset is mentioned as a benchmark for evaluating model performance under corruptions. The authors discuss how their methods achieve state-of-the-art results on this dataset as well.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- For **CIFAR-10-C**, the citation is:
  > Hendrycks, D., & Dietterich, T. (2019). Benchmarking neural network robustness to common corruptions and perturbations. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

- For **ImageNet-C**, the citation is:
  > Hendrycks, D., & Dietterich, T. (2019). Benchmarking neural network robustness to common corruptions and perturbations. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

With these citations in hand, I will ensure that I accurately document each dataset's name, description, and citation in the required format.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset identified in the paper.
