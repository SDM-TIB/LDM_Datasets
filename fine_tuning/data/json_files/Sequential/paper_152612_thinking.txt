To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning with Long Short-Term Memory for Time Series Prediction" by Yuxiu Hua et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of LSTM for predicting traffic and user mobility, which suggests that datasets related to these topics may be included.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the importance of predicting traffic and user mobility in telecommunications. This indicates that datasets related to these predictions are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

In the **data description and processing section (IV.A)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Traffic Data from GÉANT Networks**: This dataset consists of traffic data sampled every 15 minutes over a 4-month period, totaling 10,772 data points. The authors describe the preprocessing steps taken to normalize the data.

2. **User Mobility Dataset**: This dataset contains location history data from mobile users, collected at 1-hour intervals. It includes attributes such as date-time, latitude, longitude, and assigned location ID.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **GÉANT Traffic Data**, the citation is:
> S. Uhlig, B. Quoitin, J. Lepropre, and S. Balon. "Providing Public Intradomain Traffic Matrices to the Research Community." SIGCOMM Comput. Commun. Rev., vol. 36, no. 1, Jan 2006, pp. 83–86.

For the **User Mobility Dataset**, the citation is:
> J. Tkačík and P. Kordík. "Neural Turing Machine for Sequential Learning of Human Mobility Patterns." Proc. 2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), Vancouver, BC, Canada, July 2016, pp. 2790–2797.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
