To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Error Detection in Large-Scale Natural Language Understanding Systems Using Transformer Models" by Rakesh Chada et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a small dataset of human-annotated utterances with domain classification errors, which suggests that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more details.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (False Reject Detection)**, where the authors describe their methodology. They mention using a dataset with a False Reject (FR) to non-FR ratio of 1:15, but they do not provide a specific name for this dataset. I will note this ratio as it indicates the dataset's characteristics.

In **section 4 (Results)**, the authors mention that they hold out 15% of the dataset for validation, but again, they do not specify the dataset's name. This indicates that the dataset is likely proprietary or confidential, as they mention not using the true production distribution for confidentiality reasons.

Since the paper does not provide specific names or citations for the datasets used, I will need to document this lack of information. However, I will still note the characteristics of the dataset they used for training and validation, as well as the context in which it was applied.

Now, I will compile the findings regarding the dataset:

1. **Human-Annotated Dataset for False Rejects**: This dataset is used for training the model to identify domain classification errors. The authors mention that it is small and manually curated, but they do not provide a full citation or specific name.

2. **Dataset with FR to Non-FR Ratio of 1:15**: This dataset is used for testing the model's performance, but again, no specific name or citation is provided.

Since the paper lacks specific dataset citations, I will summarize the findings without a formal citation but will include the details about the dataset characteristics.

In conclusion, I will document the datasets as follows:

- **Dataset 1**: Human-annotated dataset for false rejects (no citation provided).
- **Dataset 2**: Dataset with FR to non-FR ratio of 1:15 (no citation provided).

This approach ensures that I capture the essence of the datasets discussed in the paper, even if specific citations are not available.
