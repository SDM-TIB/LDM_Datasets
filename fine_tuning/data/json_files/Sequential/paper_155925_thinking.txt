To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-center Early Sepsis Recognition by Medical Knowledge Guided Collaborative Learning for Data-scarce Hospitals" by Ruiqing Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two open clinical datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They refer to two widely-used datasets for early sepsis recognition:

1. **MIMIC-III**: This is a freely accessible critical care database that contains a wealth of clinical data, including electronic medical records from ICU patients.

2. **PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019 (Challenge)**: This dataset was used in a competition focused on early prediction of sepsis from clinical data.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MIMIC-III**, the citation is:
  > Alistair EW Johnson, Tom J Pollard, Lu Shen, H Lehman Li-Wei, Mengling Feng, Mohammad Ghassemi, Benjamin Moody, Peter Szolovits, Leo Anthony Celi, and Roger G Mark. *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific data 3, 1 (2016), 1–9. 

- For the **PhysioNet Challenge 2019**, the citation is:
  > Matthew A Reyna, Chris Josef, Salman Seyedi, Russell Jeter, Supreeth P Shashikumar, M Brandon Westover, Ashish Sharma, Shamim Nemati, and Gari D Clifford. *Early prediction of sepsis from clinical data: the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019*. In 2019 Computing in Cardiology (CinC). IEEE, Page–1.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **MIMIC-III**: A critical care database used for sepsis recognition.
   - Citation: Alistair EW Johnson et al. (2016). *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific data 3, 1, 1–9.

2. **PhysioNet Challenge 2019**: A dataset used for predicting sepsis from clinical data.
   - Citation: Matthew A Reyna et al. (2019). *Early prediction of sepsis from clinical data: the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019*. In 2019 Computing in Cardiology (CinC). IEEE, Page–1.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
