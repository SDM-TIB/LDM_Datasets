To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gated Word-Character Recurrent Language Model" by Yasumasa Miyamoto and Kyunghyun Cho, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the model is evaluated on several English corpora, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section, which is often where authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. In this paper, there is a **section 3.2 (Datasets)** that explicitly lists the datasets.

In this section, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **Penn Treebank (PTB)**: This dataset is described as being preprocessed and includes the 10k most frequent words and 51 characters. It is used for training with sentences containing fewer than 50 words.

2. **BBC**: The BBC corpus is prepared by Greene & Cunningham (2006) and uses the 10k most frequent words and 62 characters. The training phase also uses sentences with fewer than 50 words.

3. **IMDB Movie Reviews**: This dataset is prepared by Maas et al. (2011) and includes the 30k most frequent words and 74 characters, with specific sentence length restrictions for training, validation, and testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Penn Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Marcus, M. P., Santorini, B., & Marcinkiewicz, M. A. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313–330.

- For the **BBC corpus**, the citation is:
  > Greene, D., & Cunningham, P. (2006). Practical solutions to the problem of diagonal dominance in kernel document clustering. In *Machine Learning, Proceedings of the Twenty-Third International Conference (ICML 2006)*, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, June 25-29, 2006, pages 377–384.

- For the **IMDB Movie Reviews**, the citation is:
  > Maas, A. L., Daly, R. E., Pham, P. T., Huang, D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2011). Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis. In *The 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Proceedings of the Conference*, 19-24 June, 2011, Portland, Oregon, USA, pages 142–150.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
