To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention network forecasts time-to-failure in laboratory shear experiments" by Hope Jasperson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of acoustic emissions (AEs) generated in laboratory experiments, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to these AEs.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe the laboratory experiments conducted using a biaxial shearing device, which indicates that the data generated from these experiments will be crucial for understanding the datasets used.

In the **laboratory experiments** section, the authors mention using data from two specific experiments (p4581 and p4583) for their analysis. I will note the details provided about these experiments, including the conditions under which the data was collected, such as the normal stress levels and the number of stick-slip events recorded.

I will also check the **results** and **discussion** sections to see if the authors refer to any additional datasets or provide further context about the datasets used in their analysis. The paper mentions that the dataset consists of nearly 400 stick-slip events under various stress conditions, which is important information to include.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include full citations for any datasets referenced in the paper. For example, the authors mention that the laboratory data is publicly available at a specific URL, which I will include as part of the dataset citation.

Finally, I will format the extracted datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its relevant details, including the context of its use in the research.

Here are the datasets I will extract:

1. **Laboratory Dataset from Experiment p4581**: This dataset includes acoustic emissions recorded during the biaxial shear experiments, with specific conditions such as normal stress levels ranging from 2-8 MPa.

2. **Laboratory Dataset from Experiment p4583**: Similar to p4581, this dataset also includes acoustic emissions from stick-slip events under varying stress conditions.

I will ensure to provide the full citation for the datasets, including the URL where the data can be accessed.

Now, I will proceed to compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing.
