To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep State Space Recurrent Neural Networks for Time Series Forecasting" by Hugo Inzirillo, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the modeling of cryptocurrency market dynamics, which suggests that there may be datasets related to cryptocurrency prices or trading volumes.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly in **section 4 (Deep State Space Models)** and **section 4.3 (Learning Task)**, where the author describes the data used for the experiments. Here, the author mentions downloading the open, high, low, close (OHLC) data of Bitcoin from cryptocompare.com and computing log returns. This indicates that the dataset used for the experiments is related to Bitcoin price data.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the context of covariates, such as the "High Minus Low (HML)" and "intraday variance indicator (IV)" that are used in the analysis. However, these are derived metrics rather than separate datasets.

Now, I will compile the relevant datasets identified:

1. **Bitcoin OHLC Data**: This dataset includes the open, high, low, and close prices of Bitcoin, which is essential for calculating log returns and conducting the analysis.

To ensure proper citation, I will check the **References section** for the source of the Bitcoin dataset. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, but it mentions that the data was sourced from cryptocompare.com. Therefore, I will cite it as follows:

- For the **Bitcoin OHLC Data**, the citation is:
  > CryptoCompare. *Bitcoin Historical Data*. Available at: https://www.cryptocompare.com/ (Accessed: [insert access date]).

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
