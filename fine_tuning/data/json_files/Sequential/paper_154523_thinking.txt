To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DEFT: Detection Embeddings for Tracking" by Mohamed Chaabane et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors discuss the performance of their method on various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **MOT Challenge (MOT16/MOT17)**: This dataset is used for evaluating multi-object tracking performance. The authors note that it consists of indoor and outdoor pedestrian tracking sequences.

2. **KITTI Tracking**: This dataset is composed of sequences collected using cameras mounted on a moving vehicle, specifically for evaluating tracking performance in a driving context.

3. **nuScenes**: A large-scale dataset for autonomous driving, which includes sequences collected in various conditions and is used for monocular 3D visual tracking.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. Here are the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MOT Challenge (MOT16/MOT17)**, the citation is:
  > Anton Milan, Laura Leal-TaixÃ©, Ian Reid, Stefan Roth, and Konrad Schindler. *MOT16: A Benchmark for Multi-Object Tracking*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1603.00831, 2016.

- For **KITTI Tracking**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for Autonomous Driving? The KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2012.

- For **nuScenes**, the citation is:
  > Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yu Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *nuScenes: A multi-modal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
