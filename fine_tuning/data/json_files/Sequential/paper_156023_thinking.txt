To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An End-to-End Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Framework" by Fuad Hasan and Hailong Huang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed model is evaluated on the **BLVD dataset** and implemented on **CARLA**, which indicates that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that the model was trained, validated, and tested on the **BLVD dataset**, which consists of 654 high-resolution videos with detailed annotations. This confirms that the BLVD dataset is a primary dataset used in their research.

Additionally, the authors reference the **NGSIM dataset** in the introduction, indicating its common use in highway trajectory prediction studies. However, they note limitations in using this dataset, which suggests that while it is relevant, the focus is primarily on the BLVD dataset for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to gather full citations for both datasets:

1. **BLVD Dataset**: The citation for the BLVD dataset is:
   > J. Xue, J. Fang, T. Li, B. Zhang, P. Zhang, Z. Ye, and J. Dou. *BLVD: Building a Large-Scale 5D Semantics Benchmark for Autonomous Driving*. arXiv, vol. 1903.06405, 2019.

2. **NGSIM Dataset**: The citation for the NGSIM dataset is:
   > Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM). Available online: http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/trafficanalysistools/ngsim.html (accessed on 20 September 2022).

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
