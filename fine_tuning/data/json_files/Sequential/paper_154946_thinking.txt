To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepExpress: Heterogeneous and Coupled Sequence Modeling for Express Delivery Prediction" by Siyuan Ren et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of express delivery sequence prediction and mention that they will evaluate their model on real-world data. This suggests that datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 5 (Evaluation)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three sub-datasets:

1. **Express Delivery Dataset**: This dataset contains records of daily sent or received parcels across various regions (university, company, urban village, residential) in Xi’an, China, covering a time span from June 2016 to September 2018. It includes 5,881,166 instances and various weather conditions.

2. **Holiday Schedule Dataset**: This dataset includes public holiday information, categorized into four types (e-commerce activity days, festivals, statutory holidays, and ordinary times). It is used to analyze the impact of holidays on delivery volumes.

3. **Weather Forecast Dataset**: This dataset consists of historical weather data for Xi’an, including daytime weather conditions and temperatures, classified into fifteen types. It is crucial for understanding how weather impacts delivery volumes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, the datasets themselves may not have formal citations like traditional publications. Instead, I will summarize the information provided in the paper:

- For the **Express Delivery Dataset**, the authors collected data from express logistics companies in Xi’an, but no specific citation is provided since it is proprietary data.

- The **Holiday Schedule Dataset** is based on public information regarding holidays in China, which may not have a formal citation but can be referenced as "China's legal holiday schedule and festival calendar."

- The **Weather Forecast Dataset** is derived from historical weather data from a weather forecast website, which can be referenced as "Historical weather data from the China weather forecast website."

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the context and details as described in the paper. Each dataset will be clearly labeled, and I will note that some datasets may not have formal citations but are based on publicly available information.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring clarity and completeness in the descriptions.
