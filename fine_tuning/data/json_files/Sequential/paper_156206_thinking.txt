To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Hybrid Optimization and Deep Learning Algorithm for Cyber-resilient DER Control" by Mohammad Panahazari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of the **IEEE 37-node feeder** for validation, which indicates that this is a dataset relevant to the study.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** where the authors describe the experimental setup. They mention using a modified single-phase **IEEE 37-node test feeder** and refer to the generation profile data based on real solar radiation data from the **NREL Measurement and Instrumentation Data Center (MIDC)**. This suggests that there are specific datasets being utilized for the experiments.

In the **validation and results section**, the authors provide details about the generation profile data, which is generated based on real solar radiation data from Sacramento, CA, on August 15, 2012. This is another dataset that I need to document.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **IEEE 37-node feeder**, the citation is:
   > Gan, H., Zhang, J., Wang, J., Hou, D., Jiang, Y., & Gao, D. W. (2021). Cyber physical grid-interactive distributed energy resources control for VPP dispatch and regulation. In *IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Europe, ISGT Europe 2021*, Espoo, Finland, October 18-21, 2021, pp. 1-5.

2. For the **NREL Measurement and Instrumentation Data Center (MIDC)**, the citation is:
   > National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). (2012). *Measurement and Instrumentation Data Center (MIDC)*. Retrieved from https://www.nrel.gov/midc.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This will prepare the information for structured output or further analysis.
