To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Branched Multi-Task Networks" by Simon Vandenhende et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to focus on the sections where the authors discuss their methodology and results, particularly the **experiments section**.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors describe their evaluation on several datasets. I will look for specific mentions of datasets used in their experiments. The first dataset mentioned is the **Cityscapes dataset**, which is described in detail in **section 4.1**. The authors provide information about the number of images and the tasks associated with this dataset.

Next, I will check **section 4.2 (Taskonomy)**, where the authors discuss the **Taskonomy dataset**. They provide details about the number of tasks and images, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope.

Then, I will look at **section 4.3 (CelebA)**, where the authors mention the **CelebA dataset**. They provide information about the number of images and the tasks related to facial attribute classification.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

The citations I will extract are as follows:

1. For the **Cityscapes dataset**, the citation is:
   > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In CVPR, 2016.

2. For the **Taskonomy dataset**, the citation is:
   > Amir R Zamir, Alexander Sax, William Shen, Leonidas J Guibas, Jitendra Malik, and Silvio Savarese. *Taskonomy: Disentangling task transfer learning*. In CVPR, 2018.

3. For the **CelebA dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In ICCV, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
