To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dilated Convolution with Dilated GRU for Music Source Separation" by Jen-Yu Liu and Yi-Hsuan Yang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the goal of music source separation and hints at the use of specific datasets for evaluation. The introduction may provide additional context or references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their model on the **MUSDB18 dataset**. I will need to gather details about this dataset, including its composition and purpose.

In the **evaluation setup** section, the authors describe the MUSDB18 dataset in detail, stating that it contains 100 songs for training and 50 songs for evaluation, with each song containing separate source audios for vocals, drums, bass, and other instruments. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and its relevance to the research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MUSDB18 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Stöter, F.-R., Liutkus, A., & Ito, N. (2018). The 2018 signal separation evaluation campaign. In Proceedings of the LVA/ICA, pages 293–305.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will focus solely on the MUSDB18 dataset for my extraction.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MUSDB18 dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
