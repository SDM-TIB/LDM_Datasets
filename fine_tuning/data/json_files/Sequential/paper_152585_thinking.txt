To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recurrent Transition Networks for Character Locomotion" by FÃ©lix G. Harvey and Christopher Pal, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for large animation graphs and the challenges of manually authoring transitions. They mention leveraging high-quality data from Motion Capture (MOCAP) based animations, which indicates that a dataset is involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data Formatting)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that the data was captured in a MOCAP studio using a Vicon system and provide a summary of the motion categories in Table 1. The dataset includes various motion categories such as Flat Locomotion, Terrain Locomotion, Dance, and Others, with a total of 508,428 frames.

I will also look for any specific references to publicly available datasets or comparisons with existing datasets. The authors mention that the locomotion components of their dataset are similar to publicly available terrain locomotion data from Holden et al. (2017), which suggests that I should include this reference as well.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned. The key datasets identified are:

1. **Terrain Locomotion Dataset**: This dataset is described in detail in the paper, but the authors do not provide a specific citation for it since it is their own dataset derived from MOCAP data.

2. **Holden et al. (2017)**: The authors reference this work for the terrain locomotion data. The full citation is:
   > Daniel Holden, Taku Komura, and Jun Saito. *Phase-functioned neural networks for character control*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG) 36, 4 (2017), 42.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for any referenced datasets. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
