To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Empirical Exploration of Skip Connections for Sequential Tagging" by Huijia Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to look deeper into the paper for specific dataset details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the tasks of sequential tagging, such as part-of-speech (POS) tagging and combinatory category grammar (CCG) supertagging. They mention that their model is evaluated on these tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find the specific datasets used.

Next, I will examine **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **CCGBank**: This dataset is used for the CCG supertagging task. The authors state that it is a translation from the Penn Treebank to CCG, with a coverage of 99.4%. They follow standard splits for training, development, and testing.

2. **Penn Treebank**: This dataset is referenced as the source for the CCGBank dataset. It is used for the POS tagging task, with standard splits mentioned for training and testing.

In the **references section**, I will look for full citations for both datasets:

- For **CCGBank**, the citation is:
  > Julia Hockenmaier and Mark Steedman. *CCGBank: A Corpus of CCG Derivations and Dependency Structures Extracted from the Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 33(3):355–396, 2007.

- For **Penn Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Mitchell P Marcus, Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz, and Beatrice Santorini. *Building a Large Annotated Corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2):313–330, 1993.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
