To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prediction-Coherent LSTM-based Recurrent Neural Network for Safer Glucose Predictions in Diabetic People" by Maxime De Bois et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study involves predicting glucose values in diabetic patients, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, specifically **section 3 (Methods)**, where the authors describe the experimental data. Here, they mention two distinct datasets:

1. **Ohio T1DM Dataset**: This dataset was first published for the Blood Glucose Level Prediction Challenge in 2018 and includes data from six type 1 diabetic individuals monitored over eight weeks. The authors specify that the dataset comprises glucose readings, daily insulin boluses, and meal information.

2. **IDIAB Dataset**: This dataset was collected from five type 2 diabetic patients, with ethical approval for its use. It includes glucose levels recorded by Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) devices and food intake logged in a coaching app.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Ohio T1DM Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marling, C., & Bunescu, R. (2018). The OhioT1DM dataset for blood glucose level prediction. In *The 3rd International Workshop on Knowledge Discovery in Healthcare Data*, Stockholm, Sweden.

- For the **IDIAB Dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the text, but it is mentioned that the data collection was approved by the French ethical committee. I will note that the authors may have referenced the dataset in other works or it may be available through their institutional repositories.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, ready for further processing or review.
