To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differentiable Tree Operations Promote Compositional Generalization" by Paul Soulos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors present a new architecture and mention a dataset for testing tree-to-tree transformations, which suggests that there is a specific dataset to look for.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Empirical Validation)**, where the authors explicitly introduce the **Basic Sentence Transforms dataset**. This section provides a detailed description of the dataset's purpose, structure, and the tasks it encompasses. The dataset is designed to test compositional generalization in structure transformations, which is a key aspect of their research.

The authors mention that the dataset includes various synthetic tree-transform tasks, including a Lisp function interpreter task and several natural-language tasks inspired by semantic parsing and language generation. They also specify that each task has five splits: train, validation, test, out-of-distribution lexical (OOD-lexical), and out-of-distribution structural (OOD-structural). 

I will also check the **appendices** for additional details about the dataset construction and samples, which can provide further context and specifics about the dataset's design and intended use.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the dataset in the **References section**. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- **Basic Sentence Transforms Dataset**: 
  > Soulos, P., Hu, E., McCurdy, K., Chen, Y., Fernandez, R., Smolensky, P., & Gao, J. (2023). Differentiable Tree Operations Promote Compositional Generalization. In Proceedings of the 40th International Conference on Machine Learning, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA. PMLR 202, 2023.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset details:

1. **Basic Sentence Transforms Dataset**: This dataset is designed for testing tree-to-tree transformations and includes various synthetic tasks. It has five splits: train (10,000 samples), validation (1,250 samples), test (1,250 samples), out-of-distribution lexical (1,250 samples), and out-of-distribution structural (1,250 samples).

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further use or analysis.
