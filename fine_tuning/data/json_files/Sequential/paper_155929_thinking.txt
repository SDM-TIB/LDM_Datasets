To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Novel Poisoned Water Detection Method Using Smartphone Embedded Wi-Fi Technology and Machine Learning Algorithms" by Halgurd S. Maghdid et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or alluded to. The abstract discusses the use of Wi-Fi signals to distinguish between clean and poisoned water, which suggests that there is a dataset involved in this research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In the **dataset collection** subsection of **section 3**, the authors describe the process of collecting Wi-Fi Channel-State-Information (CSI) data. They mention that they collected data during three trials: one with clean water and two with poisoned water at different concentrations (1000 ppm and 100 ppm).

The details provided indicate that the dataset consists of:
- **Clean Water**: 2644 CSI measurements.
- **Poisoned Water (1000 ppm)**: 2826 CSI measurements.
- **Poisoned Water (100 ppm)**: 2826 CSI measurements.

This gives a total of **5470 records** collected from these experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for any datasets or methodologies referenced in the paper. The authors mention using lead nitrate (Pb(NO3)2) to prepare the poisoned water, but they do not cite a specific dataset from another source; instead, they describe their own dataset collection process.

Since the dataset is original and created by the authors, I will document it as follows:

1. **Wi-Fi CSI Dataset for Poisoned Water Detection**: This dataset includes measurements of Wi-Fi signals transmitted through clean and poisoned water samples. The dataset is publicly available for future research.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper itself, as it is the source of the dataset.

The citation for the paper is:

Asaad, Aras Asaad. *A Novel Poisoned Water Detection Method Using Smartphone Embedded Wi-Fi Technology and Machine Learning Algorithms*. Koya University, Kurdistan Region of Iraq.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
