To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Compact LSTM-SVM Fusion Model for Long-Duration Cardiovascular Diseases Detection" by Siyang Wu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of the **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset** and the **MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Dataset**, indicating that these are the primary datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **data acquisition section**. Here, the author explicitly states that they are working with two datasets:

1. **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset**: This dataset is referenced multiple times throughout the paper, particularly in the context of evaluating the proposed model. The author mentions that each record is split into 10-second segments and labeled according to the AAMI criteria.

2. **MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Dataset**: Similar to the Arrhythmia dataset, this dataset is also segmented into 10-second intervals and labeled based on the rhythm present in the data.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Moody GB, Mark RG. The impact of the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. IEEE Eng in Med and Biol 20(3):45-50 (May-June 2001). (PMID: 11446209)

- For the **MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Moody GB, Mark RG. A new method for detecting atrial fibrillation using R-R intervals. Computers in Cardiology. 10:227-230 (1983).

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, ensuring to include their names, descriptions, and full citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is crucial for any further analysis or replication of the study.
