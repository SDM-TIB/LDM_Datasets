To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Enhanced Conv-TasNet Model for Speech Separation Using a Speaker Distance-Based Loss Function" by Jose A. Arango-Sánchez and Julián D. Arias-Londoño, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors explore different training strategies using the Conv-TasNet model, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, the authors mention three specific datasets:

1. **CallFriend-Spanish (CF)**: This dataset consists of 36.6 hours of unscripted telephone conversations between native Spanish speakers. It is crucial to note the dataset's duration and context.

2. **CallFriend-Caribbean-Accent-Spanish**: This dataset contains 26.0 hours of similar conversations but focuses on speakers with Caribbean accents.

3. **CallHome-Spanish**: This dataset includes 32.4 hours of telephone conversations, also involving native Spanish speakers.

The authors also mention a combined dataset called **CallFriend-Caribbean-CallHome (CFC_All)**, which aggregates the three datasets for a total of 95.0 hours of audio.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. However, the datasets mentioned are likely to be part of the TalkBank project, which is referenced in the paper. Therefore, I will use the following citation for the datasets:

- For **CallFriend and CallHome datasets**, the citation is:
  > MacWhinney, B., & Wagner, J. (2010). Transcribing, searching and data sharing: The CLAN software and the TalkBank data repository. *Gesprachsforschung: Online-Zeitschrift zur verbalen Interaktion*, 11, 154.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
