To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Finnish Language Modeling with Deep Transformer Models" by Abhilash Jain et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a sub-word model setting with Finnish language data, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **section III (Data)**, where the authors provide details about the dataset used for their language modeling task. Here, they mention that the Finnish text data consists mainly of newspapers and books, totaling around 144 million word tokens and 4.2 million unique tokens. This indicates that there is a significant dataset being utilized.

The authors reference the source of their dataset as [14], which I will need to check in the **References section** to obtain the full citation. The reference states:
> CSC - IT Center for Science, "The Finnish text collection," http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:lb-2016050207, 1998.

Additionally, they mention using Morfessor 2.0 for subword tokenization, which is also referenced in the paper. The citation for Morfessor is:
> P. Smit, S. Virpioja, S.-A. Grönroos, and M. Kurimo, "Morfessor 2.0: Toolkit for statistical morphological segmentation," in Proceedings of the Demonstrations at the 14th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 21–24, 2014.

Now, I will compile the dataset information:

1. **Finnish Text Dataset**: This dataset consists of Finnish newspapers and books, with a total of 144 million word tokens and 4.2 million unique tokens. It is used for training language models in the paper.

2. **Morfessor 2.0**: This is a toolkit used for subword tokenization in the Finnish language, which is crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the full citations for both datasets ready for inclusion in the final output.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
