To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Few-Shot Generalization Across Dialogue Tasks" by Vladimir Vlasov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new dialogue policy and the evaluation of its performance, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention generating dialogues for supervised learning, specifically cooperative and uncooperative dialogues. They indicate that they created two datasets:

1. **Hotel Domain Dataset**: This dataset includes 120 dialogues generated for the hotel domain, with 108 unique dialogues after removing duplicates. It consists of both cooperative and uncooperative dialogues.

2. **Restaurant Domain Dataset**: This dataset includes 50 uncooperative dialogues and 8 cooperative dialogues for the restaurant domain. The authors mention that these dialogues are used to measure the transfer learning abilities of the dialogue policies.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the datasets are generated by the authors and do not have external citations. Instead, I will note that the datasets are created for the purpose of the study and are part of the experimental setup.

Since the datasets are not publicly available or cited from external sources, I will document them as follows:

- **Hotel Domain Dataset**: Generated by the authors for the purpose of this research, consisting of 120 dialogues, with 108 unique dialogues after duplicates are removed.

- **Restaurant Domain Dataset**: Also generated by the authors, consisting of 50 uncooperative dialogues and 8 cooperative dialogues.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. It's important to note that while these datasets are not formally cited, they are integral to the research and should be acknowledged as such.
