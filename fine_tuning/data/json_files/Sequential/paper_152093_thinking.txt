To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decoupled Neural Interfaces using Synthetic Gradients" by Max Jaderberg et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3), as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details about their characteristics or usage in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **Penn Treebank dataset** for character-level language modeling. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its significance in the context of the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For the **Penn Treebank dataset**, the citation is:
> Marcus, M. P., Marcinkiewicz, M. A., and Santorini, B. "Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank." *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2):313â€“330, 1993.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset's name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and properly formatted, ready for any further processing or review.
