To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Singing-Tacotron: Global Duration Control Attention and Dynamic Filter for End-to-End Singing Voice Synthesis" by Tao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of alignment in singing voice synthesis but does not explicitly mention datasets. However, the introduction may provide more context.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference various DNN-based singing voice synthesis models but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **experiments section**, as this is where datasets are typically detailed.

In **section 3 (Experiments)**, the authors state that they used **100 Chinese songs** performed by a female singer for their experiments. They specify that 95 songs were used for training and 5 songs for testing. The musical scores and lyrics are annotated in MusicXML format. This is a crucial piece of information indicating the dataset used.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the following relevant references:

1. For the **100 Chinese songs**, the citation is:
   > Data Baker. "Chinese female song 1." [Online], https://test.data-baker.com/data/index/compose.

2. For the **MusicXML format**, the citation is:
   > Michael Good. "MusicXML in commercial applications," 2006.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- **100 Chinese songs** (training and testing dataset)
- **MusicXML format** (for annotations)

I will ensure to include the full citations for each dataset in the final output.
