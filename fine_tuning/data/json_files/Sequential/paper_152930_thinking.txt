To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Human-Centered Emotion Recognition in Animated GIFs" by Zhengyuan Yang, Yixuan Zhang, and Jiebo Luo, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a proposed framework that outperforms the state-of-the-art on the **MIT GIFGIF dataset**, indicating that this dataset is significant to the research.

Next, I will check the **introduction** for any additional context about datasets. The authors discuss the importance of GIFs in emotion recognition and reference the **GIFGIF dataset** as a platform frequently used for such studies. This reinforces the relevance of the dataset.

In the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1**, the authors provide detailed information about the **GIFGIF dataset**. They describe it as being collected from the MIT Media Lab's GIFGIF platform, consisting of 6,119 GIFs with over 3.2 million user votes, and mention that the dataset is labeled for 17 emotions. This section confirms the dataset's significance and provides context for its use in their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the **GIFGIF dataset**. The relevant citation is:

- For the **GIFGIF dataset**, the citation is:
  > Weixuan Chen, Ognjen Oggi Rudovic, and Rosalind W Picard. *Gifgif+: Collecting emotional animated gifs with clustered multi-task learning*. In Proceedings of the 2017 International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII), pages 410â€“417, 2017.

Since the authors also mention the **GIFGIF+ dataset** as a larger dataset that is not yet released, I will note that it is referenced but not available for citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for the **GIFGIF dataset** with its full citation, ensuring that it is ready for any structured output or further processing.
