To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LoRCoN-LO: Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network-based LiDAR Odometry" by Donghwi Jung et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using a public dataset, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the advantages of LiDAR in autonomous driving and mention the use of deep learning methods. However, I need to find the specific dataset they utilized.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they used the **KITTI dataset** to test their algorithm's performance. This is a clear identification of the dataset used in their research.

Now, I will look into the **references section** to find the full citation for the KITTI dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **KITTI dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Geiger, P. Lenz, and R. Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3354â€“3361, 2012.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their corresponding citations from the paper.
