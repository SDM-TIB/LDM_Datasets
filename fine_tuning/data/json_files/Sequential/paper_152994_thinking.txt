To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning for Interference Identification: Band, Training SNR, and Sample Selection" by Xiwen Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors study interference source identification using deep learning algorithms on received samples from a 10 MHz band in the 2.4 GHz ISM Band. This suggests that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **Problem Setup section** where the authors describe the dataset generated by Schmidt et al. [8]. They mention that this dataset consists of 225,225 sample vectors for 15 classes, which is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized. I will take note of the details provided about the dataset, including the number of classes and the SNR range.

In the **Results section**, the authors discuss their findings based on the dataset and mention various modifications they made to the dataset, such as band selection and SNR selection. This reinforces the importance of the dataset in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The relevant citation for the dataset analyzed in this paper is:

- For the dataset by Schmidt et al.:
  > M. Schmidt, D. Block, U. Meier. (online, Mar. 2017). Wireless Interference Identification with Convolutional Neural Networks. ArXiv preprint: 1703.00737.

Additionally, I will note that the dataset is available at the URL provided in the paper: https://crawdad.org/owl/interference/20180925/.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the dataset details, including its purpose, the number of classes, and the source citation, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
