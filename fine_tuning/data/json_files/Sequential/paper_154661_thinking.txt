To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Introduction of mini-AlphaStar" by Ruo-Ze Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the mini-AlphaStar implementation but does not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction discusses the StarCraft II learning environment and references AlphaStar, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the **Supervised Learning** subsection. Here, the authors describe the training data as "game replays from human players that were pre-processed into the feature label format." This indicates that the dataset consists of game replays, but I need to find more specific details.

In the **Reinforcement Learning** subsection, the authors mention maintaining two states during training, but they do not specify datasets. However, they describe the training process and the types of data used, which reinforces that the dataset is based on game replays.

I will also check the **References section** for any citations related to datasets. The references primarily cite foundational works in reinforcement learning and previous research on StarCraft II, but they do not provide specific dataset citations.

Since the paper does not provide explicit names or citations for datasets, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

1. **Game Replays Dataset**: This dataset consists of game replays from human players, which have been pre-processed into a feature-label format for training the mini-AlphaStar agent. The features represent the game states, while the labels represent the actions taken by the players.

Since there are no formal citations provided for the dataset in the paper, I will note that the dataset is derived from the gameplay of human players in StarCraft II, but I cannot provide a full citation as there is no specific reference to a published dataset.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I highlight the lack of formal citations for the dataset used in this research.
