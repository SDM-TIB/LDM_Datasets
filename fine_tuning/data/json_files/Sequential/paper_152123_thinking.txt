To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recurrent Soft Attention Model for Common Object Recognition" by Liliang Ren, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the author states that the model is tested on the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is used for evaluation.

Next, I will look closely at the **experiments section** where the author provides more details about the CIFAR-10 dataset. The author mentions that CIFAR-10 consists of **50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images across 10 classes**. This gives me a clear understanding of the dataset's structure and purpose.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the CIFAR-10 dataset and does not mention any other datasets, I will now proceed to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset in the **References section**. The CIFAR-10 dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of computer vision, and its citation is typically found in foundational papers or datasets.

The full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset is:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset of images*. 2009.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify any datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for detailed information about the datasets used.
3. Locate the full citation for the identified dataset in the references.

This method ensures that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the research paper.
