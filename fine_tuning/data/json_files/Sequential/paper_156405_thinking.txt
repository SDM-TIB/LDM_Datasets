To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LSTM-CNN: An efficient diagnostic network for Parkinson’s disease utilizing dynamic handwriting analysis" by Xuechao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on two datasets: **DraWritePD** and **PaHaW**. This is a good starting point, as it suggests that these datasets are central to the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about these datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of handwriting analysis in diagnosing Parkinson's disease but does not provide further details about the datasets.

Moving on to **section 3 (Materials)**, I will find detailed descriptions of the datasets. Here, the authors provide specific information about both datasets:

1. **DraWritePD**: This dataset was acquired by the authors and includes handwriting samples from 20 Parkinson's disease patients and 29 healthy controls. The data consists of dynamic signals captured during handwriting tasks, with various independent dynamic variables recorded.

2. **PaHaW**: This dataset includes handwriting data from 37 Parkinson's disease patients and 38 age and gender-matched healthy controls. The data was collected using a digitizing tablet, and it captures several dynamic variables during handwriting tasks.

In this section, I will also note the data acquisition methods and any relevant details about the tasks performed, as these can be important for understanding the datasets' contexts.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets:

- For **DraWritePD**, since it is an original dataset created by the authors, I will note that it does not have a formal citation but will mention it as an acquired dataset in the context of the paper.

- For **PaHaW**, the citation is:
  > P. Drotár, J. Mekyska, I. Rektorová, L. Masarová, Z. Smékal, M. Faundez-Zanuy. *Evaluation of handwriting kinematics and pressure for differential diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease*. Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, 67, 39-46, 2016.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will summarize the findings, ensuring to include the full citations where applicable. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, ready for further processing or review.
