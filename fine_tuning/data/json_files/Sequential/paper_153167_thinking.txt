To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting Radical Text over Online Media using Deep Learning" by Armaan Kaur et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions that the authors collected a total of **61,601 records from various online sources**, which indicates that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **data collection section** (3.1) where the authors provide detailed information about the sources of their dataset. They mention that the data was collected from multiple sources, including blogs, articles, Twitter, and news. Specifically, they list several sources under **Table 3**, which details the types of data collected, the time periods, and the number of records from each source.

The sources listed in Table 3 include:

1. **Greater Kashmir** (News) - 52 records from 2018
2. **Kashmir Reader** (News) - 35,637 records from 2014-2018
3. **Kashmir Monitor** (News) - 1,403 records from 2018
4. **Tribune** (News) - 20,994 records from 2016-2018
5. **Huriyat** (Articles) - 62 records from 2010-2013
6. **JKLF World** (Blogs) - 591 records from 2017-2019
7. **JKPFL** (Blogs) - 478 records from 2009-2018
8. **Kashmir Truth be Told** (Blogs) - 84 records from 2010-2015
9. **Peoples League** (Blogs) - 145 records from 2006-2010
10. **Sameer Bhatt** (Blogs) - 276 records from 2009-2016
11. **Tanveer and Kashmir** (Blogs) - 475 records from 2006-2017
12. **United Kashmir** (Blogs) - 1,343 records from 2008-2019

The total number of records collected is **61,601**.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the individual datasets collected from the various sources. Instead, it focuses on the methodology and the results derived from the collected data.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for the datasets, I will summarize the dataset information based on the details provided in Table 3 without formal citations. However, I will note that the datasets are derived from publicly available online sources, and the authors have not attributed them to specific publications.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly indicate the sources and the number of records collected from each source, while also acknowledging the lack of formal citations for these datasets.

This approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research while adhering to the importance of citation as much as possible given the context of the paper.
