To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling and Forecasting Intraday Market Returns: a Machine Learning Approach" by IÃºri H. Ferreira and Marcelo C. Medeiros, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors examine the relationship between market returns and volatility measures using high-frequency data, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention using minute-by-minute intraday data for the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) and the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). This is a clear indication of the datasets they are working with.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data)**, where the authors provide detailed information about their dataset. They specify that their dataset consists of 1-minute frequency data for both SPY and VIX, covering 3,000 business days from January 2005 to December 2016. They also describe how they calculate log-returns for SPY and transform the VIX data for their analysis.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are commonly used financial datasets. However, I can provide the following citations for the sources of the datasets:

1. **S&P 500 ETF (SPY)**: 
   > SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.spdrs.com/products/etf/spdr-sp-500-etf-SPY

2. **CBOE Volatility Index (VIX)**: 
   > CBOE. (n.d.). CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). Retrieved from https://www.cboe.com/vix

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **S&P 500 ETF (SPY)**: Minute-by-minute intraday data for the SPY covering 3,000 business days from January 2005 to December 2016.
2. **CBOE Volatility Index (VIX)**: Minute-by-minute intraday data for the VIX covering the same period.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
