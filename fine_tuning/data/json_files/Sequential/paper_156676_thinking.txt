To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TKAN: Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks" by RÃ©mi Genet and Hugo Inzirillo, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the TKAN architecture and its application in time series forecasting, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Learning Task)**, where the authors describe the task they created for their model. They mention using **Binance** as the data source for their dataset, which consists of notional amounts traded each hour on various cryptocurrency assets. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including the specific assets involved and the time period covered.

The dataset is described as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: Binance Cryptocurrency Trading Data
- **Description**: The dataset includes notional amounts traded each hour on several assets: BTC, ETH, ADA, XMR, EOS, MATIC, TRX, FTM, BNB, XLM, ENJ, CHZ, BUSD, ATOM, LINK, ETC, XRP, BCH, and LTC, with a focus on predicting BTC. The data spans from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2022.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Binance dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from Binance, I will note that the citation for the dataset itself may not be formally published in a paper. Instead, I will reference Binance as the source of the data.

The citation for the Binance data source is:
> Binance. *Binance Cryptocurrency Exchange*. Available at: https://www.binance.com

Now that I have identified the dataset and its source, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: Binance Cryptocurrency Trading Data
   - **Description**: The dataset includes notional amounts traded each hour on several assets: BTC, ETH, ADA, XMR, EOS, MATIC, TRX, FTM, BNB, XLM, ENJ, CHZ, BUSD, ATOM, LINK, ETC, XRP, BCH, and LTC, with a focus on predicting BTC. The data period runs from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2022.
   - **Citation**: Binance. *Binance Cryptocurrency Exchange*. Available at: https://www.binance.com

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
