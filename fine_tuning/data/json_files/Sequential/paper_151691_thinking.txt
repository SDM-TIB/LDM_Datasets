To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dank Learning: Generating Memes Using Deep Neural Networks" by Abel L. Peirson V and E. Meltem Tolunay, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the work. The introduction often discusses the background and may reference datasets used in previous studies or the current research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Approach)**, where the authors describe their dataset in detail. Here, they mention that their dataset consists of approximately 400,000 image, label, and caption triplets, which is a significant dataset for their meme generation task. They also indicate that the dataset was acquired from a specific source, which is crucial for citation purposes.

In this section, they refer to the source of their dataset as "Memegenerator.net" and provide a link to it. This is important as it gives me the necessary information to create a full citation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any additional citations related to the dataset. The authors reference various works, but the most relevant for the dataset is the mention of Memegenerator.net. I will format this citation correctly.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Memegenerator.net. (2018). Meme Generator [online] Available at: http://www.memegenerator.net/ [Accessed 21 Mar. 2018].

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and ensure that I include the full citation in the final output.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation, ensuring that it is ready for review or further processing.
