To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recurrent Multimodal Interaction for Referring Image Segmentation" by Chenxi Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their model on benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. This section is crucial as it typically contains the names and descriptions of the datasets.

The paper mentions four datasets:

1. **Google-Ref**: This dataset contains 104,560 expressions referring to 54,822 objects from 26,711 images selected from MS COCO. The expressions are longer and richer, averaging 8.43 words in length.

2. **UNC**: This dataset is based on MS COCO images and consists of 142,209 referring expressions for 50,000 objects in 19,994 images. It allows unrestricted referring expressions.

3. **UNC+**: Similar to UNC, this dataset also uses MS COCO images but consists of 141,564 expressions for 49,856 objects in 19,992 images. The key difference is that no location words are allowed in the expressions.

4. **ReferItGame**: This dataset contains 130,525 expressions referring to 96,654 distinct objects in 19,894 natural images. It includes segmentation masks for both objects and "stuff" categories.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **Google-Ref**, the citation is:
  > Mao, J., Huang, J., Toshev, A., Camburu, O., Yuille, A. L. (2016). Generation and comprehension of unambiguous object descriptions. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 11-20.

- For **UNC**, the citation is:
  > Kazemzadeh, S., Ordonez, V., Matten, M., & Berg, T. L. (2014). ReferItGame: Referring to objects in photographs of natural scenes. In Proceedings of the Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 787-798.

- For **UNC+**, the citation is the same as UNC since it is a variant of the dataset.

- For **ReferItGame**, the citation is:
  > Kazemzadeh, S., Ordonez, V., Matten, M., & Berg, T. L. (2014). ReferItGame: Referring to objects in photographs of natural scenes. In Proceedings of the Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 787-798.

With this information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further research and allow others to utilize these datasets effectively.
