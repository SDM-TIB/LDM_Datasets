To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automated Curriculum Learning for Neural Networks" by Alex Graves et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a method for selecting a syllabus for neural networks but does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction references various tasks and curricula, which may imply the use of datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors describe three task suites used for their experiments: 

1. **N-Gram Language Modelling**: The authors mention using the King James Bible data from the Canterbury corpus to generate datasets for training. This indicates that the dataset is derived from a specific source.

2. **Repeat Copy**: The authors describe generating random bit vector sequences for this task but do not specify a named dataset. Instead, they mention the number of tasks and the nature of the input data.

3. **bAbI**: The authors explicitly mention using the bAbI dataset, which consists of 20 synthetic question-answering problems designed to test reasoning capabilities.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **Canterbury corpus**, the citation is:
  > Arnold, R. and Bell, T. (1997). A corpus for the evaluation of lossless compression algorithms. In Data Compression Conference, 1997. DCC’97. Proceedings, pages 201–210. IEEE.

- For the **bAbI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Weston, J., Bordes, A., Chopra, S., and Mikolov, T. (2015). Towards AI-complete question answering: A set of prerequisite toy tasks. CoRR, abs/1502.05698.

The **Repeat Copy** task does not have a specific dataset citation since it involves generated data rather than a pre-existing dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the datasets identified. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
