To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Sound Event Detection and Classification of Great Ape Calls Using Neural Networks" by Zifan Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validated their method on three datasets from different great ape lineages, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Data)**, as it is likely to contain the most relevant information about the datasets. In this section, the authors describe the recordings of chimpanzee pant-hoots, orangutan long calls, and bonobo high-hoots. They provide an overview of these datasets, including the number of audio clips, mean duration, total duration, number of individuals, and call types.

From the information provided in section 3, I can identify the following datasets:

1. **Chimpanzee Dataset**: This dataset consists of 235 audio clips of chimpanzee pant-hoots, with a mean duration of approximately 8 seconds per clip and a total duration of 1,964 seconds. It includes calls from 11 individuals (all male).

2. **Orangutan Dataset**: This dataset contains 65 audio clips of orangutan long calls, with a mean duration of approximately 74 seconds per clip and a total duration of 4,817 seconds. It includes calls from 10 individuals (all male).

3. **Bonobo Dataset**: This dataset comprises 28 audio clips of bonobo high-hoots, with a mean duration of approximately 24 seconds per clip and a total duration of 677 seconds. It includes calls from 7 individuals (3 male and 4 female).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely original recordings collected by the authors or other researchers in the field.

Since the datasets are described in detail within the paper, I will compile the information about each dataset, including the dataset name, description, and relevant statistics, while ensuring to note that the citations are not explicitly provided in the references.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its characteristics and any relevant notes about the source of the data.
