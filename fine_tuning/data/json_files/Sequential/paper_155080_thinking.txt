To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comprehensive Comparison of Word Embeddings in Event & Entity Coreference Resolution" by Judicael Poumay and Ashwin Ittoo, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on coreference resolution and word embeddings, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experimentation setup)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly state the dataset used for their study. Here, they mention the **ECB+ dataset**, which is crucial for their experiments on coreference resolution.

The authors describe the ECB+ dataset as one of the largest datasets for within and cross-document event and entity coreference resolution, and they provide a reference to the original source of this dataset. This is a key piece of information that confirms the dataset's relevance to their research.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the ECB+ dataset in the **References section**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Agata Cybulska and Piek Vossen. *Using a lexical diversity sledgehammer to crack a nut? In Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’14), pages 4545–4552, Reykjavik, Iceland. European Language Resources Association (ELRA), 2014.*

Additionally, the authors mention other datasets for coreference resolution, such as **GAP**, **OntoNotes**, **CoNLL 2012**, **ACE**, **TAC KBP**, and **MUC**. However, they clarify that these datasets do not suit their study's specific requirements.

I will ensure to note down the full citations for these datasets as well, even if they are not used in the experiments, as they provide context for the research.

Now, I will compile the dataset information, including the ECB+ dataset and its citation, into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **ECB+ Dataset**: 
   - Citation: Agata Cybulska and Piek Vossen. *Using a lexical diversity sledgehammer to crack a nut? In Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’14), pages 4545–4552, Reykjavik, Iceland. European Language Resources Association (ELRA), 2014.*

I will now prepare this information for output in the required format.
