To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bach Style Music Authoring System based on Deep Learning" by Minghe Kong and Lican Huang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections related to data acquisition and processing** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors use a LSTM neural network to train music feature data, which suggests that there is a dataset involved, likely related to music.

In **section 3 (Music Data Acquisition)**, the authors specify that they use **MIDI format files** as the music data source. This is a crucial piece of information, as it indicates the type of dataset they are working with. They also mention using the **music21 library** for processing the music data, which is important for understanding how the data is handled.

Next, I will look for any specific datasets or collections of music that are referenced in the paper. The authors discuss various classical repertoires, including works by Johann Sebastian Bach, but they do not explicitly name a specific dataset beyond the MIDI files. However, they do mention that they analyze and extract a large number of data information of piano music, which implies that they have compiled a dataset from various sources.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** for any works that might describe the datasets used. The references include various studies and tools related to music generation and analysis, but they do not provide a specific citation for a dataset. 

Since the authors do not provide a formal dataset citation, I will note that the dataset consists of MIDI files representing Bach's music, which they processed using the music21 library. I will also mention that the authors refer to their own constructed dataset based on the analysis of Bach's classical repertoire.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the relevant citations for any referenced works that relate to the dataset, even if they are not direct dataset citations.

The key points to include are:
1. **Dataset Name**: MIDI format files of Bach's music.
2. **Description**: The dataset consists of various classical repertoires, specifically focusing on Bach's compositions, processed using the music21 library.
3. **Citation**: Since there is no specific dataset citation, I will note the relevant references that discuss the tools and methods used for data processing.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and completeness.
