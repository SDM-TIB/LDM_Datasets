To extract datasets from the research paper titled "High Temporal Resolution Rainfall Runoff Modelling Using Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) Networks" by Wei Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets used for the rainfall runoff modeling.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to specific datasets or data sources that the authors utilized in their research. This section often outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include the datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the **data acquisition** subsection. Here, the authors describe the data sources in detail. They mention that they compiled **15-minute precipitation data from 2007 to 2017 from 153 rainfall gages maintained by the Harris County Flood Control District (HCFCD)** and **15-minute flow data obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) gages**. This is a crucial finding as it specifies the datasets used for the modeling.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors discuss the datasets further or provide any additional context about their usage in the experiments. This may include performance metrics or comparisons that rely on the datasets.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Harris County Flood Control District (HCFCD) Rainfall Data**: 
   - This dataset is referenced in the paper but does not have a formal citation. However, I can note it as:
     > Harris County Flood Control District. *15-minute precipitation data from 2007 to 2017*. Available at: https://www.hcfcd.org/projects-studies/brays-bayou/. Accessed: [insert access date].

2. **United States Geological Survey (USGS) Flow Data**: 
   - Similar to the HCFCD data, this dataset is referenced but not formally cited. I will note it as:
     > United States Geological Survey. *15-minute flow data*. Available at: https://www.usgs.gov/. Accessed: [insert access date].

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear overview of the datasets used in the study and their sources.
