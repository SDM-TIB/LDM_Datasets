To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Wavelength-based Attributed Deep Neural Network for Underwater Image Restoration" by Prasen Kumar Sharma, Ira Bisht, and Arijit Sur, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions and may mention datasets used for validation or experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **EUVP (Enhanced Underwater Visual Perception)**: This dataset consists of 11,435 paired underwater images, each of size 256 × 256, used for the enhancement task. The test set includes 515 image pairs of the same size.

2. **UIEB (Underwater Image Enhancement Benchmark)**: This dataset contains 890 paired images. The authors used a random subset of 800 images for training and the remaining 90 images for testing.

3. **UFO-120 (Underwater Focused Object 120)**: This dataset comprises 1,500 paired images for training and 120 images for testing, with ground truth images of size 640 × 480.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **EUVP**:

- For **UIEB**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
