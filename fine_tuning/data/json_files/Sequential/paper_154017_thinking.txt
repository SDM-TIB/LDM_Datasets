To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A GRU-based Mixture Density Network for Data-Driven Dynamic Stochastic Programming" by Xiaoming Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed framework on the car-sharing relocation problem, which suggests that there may be specific datasets used for validation.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Case Study)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using the **New York taxi trip record dataset** from January 2017 to June 2019. This is a crucial dataset for their experiments, and I need to gather more details about it.

In **section 3.1 (Experimental Setting)**, the authors specify that the dataset is split into a training set (from January 2017 to March 2019) and a testing set (from April 2019 to June 2019). This provides context on how the dataset is utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset in the **References section**. The authors reference the dataset with a URL link, which is essential for providing a complete citation. The citation for the New York taxi trip record dataset is as follows:
> New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission. *TLC Trip Record Data*. Available at: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and concise entry for the dataset used in the research.
