To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Customer Goals in Financial Institution Services: A Data-Driven LSTM Approach" by Andrew Estornell et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors use historical customer traces generated by a simulator, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors reference a domain-independent simulator developed by Borrajo and Veloso (2020) for generating synthetic customer behavior datasets. This is a key point as it indicates the existence of a dataset derived from this simulator.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the dataset as a "semi-synthetic dataset of customer behavior generated via a domain-independent simulator." They mention that this dataset captures interactions between customers and various banking interfaces, which provides context about the dataset's content and purpose.

I will also look for any specific details about the dataset, such as its size, structure, and the types of interactions it includes. The authors mention that the dataset consists of approximately 300 actions recorded per customer, which is useful information for understanding its scope.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The relevant citation for the dataset generated by the simulator is:

- For the dataset generated by Borrajo and Veloso:
  > Borrajo, D., & Veloso, M. (2020). Domain-independent generation and classification of behavior traces. arXiv preprint arXiv:2011.02918.

Since the paper does not provide a specific name for the dataset beyond describing it as a semi-synthetic dataset, I will refer to it as the "Customer Behavior Dataset" for clarity in my extraction.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. This will allow for easy reference and validation in future work or analyses.
