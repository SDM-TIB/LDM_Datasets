To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Investigating Recurrent Neural Network Memory Structures using Neuro-Evolution" by Alexander Ororbia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets. The abstract mentions that the EXAMM algorithm was evaluated on "large-scale, real world time series data from the aviation and power industries," indicating that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Open Data and Reproducibility)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for benchmarking their memory cells and RNNs. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Aviation Flight Recorder Data**: This dataset consists of data from 10 flights extracted from the National General Aviation Flight Information Database (NGAFID). Each flight data file lasts over an hour and includes per-second recordings from 26 parameters, with RPM and Pitch selected as prediction targets.

2. **Coal-Fired Power Plant Data**: This dataset contains 10 days of per-minute data readings from 12 burners of a coal-fired power plant. It includes 12 parameters, with Main Flame Intensity and Supplementary Fuel Flow selected as key prediction targets.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citation for the NGAFID dataset is provided in the text:

- For **NGAFID**, the citation is:
  > National General Aviation Flight Information Database (NGAFID). 2019. [Accessed Online 2019] https://ngaÔ¨Åd.org.

The coal-fired power plant dataset does not have a specific citation since it is anonymized, but I will note that it is a proprietary dataset.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets as required. 

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
