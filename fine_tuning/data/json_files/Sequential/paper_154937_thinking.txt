To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Visual Affordance Grounding from Demonstration Videos" by Hongchen Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on "two challenging datasets," which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors discuss their evaluation metrics and datasets. They mention using the **Online Product Review dataset for Affordance (OPRA)** and the **EPIC-KITCHENS (EPIC)** dataset. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the text.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a brief overview of both datasets:

1. **Online Product Review dataset for Affordance (OPRA)**: This dataset is designed for object affordance inference and contains demonstration videos, object images, affordance classes, and annotations of the interacting regions on the object image.

2. **EPIC-KITCHENS (EPIC)**: This dataset consists of a large number of egocentric videos of activities in kitchens, where each clip contains an action label and an object. The dataset is used to evaluate the model's performance in understanding human-object interactions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **OPRA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Fang, K., Wu, T.-L., Yang, D., Savarese, S., & Lim, J. J. (2018). Demo2vec: Reasoning object affordances from online videos. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

- For the **EPIC-KITCHENS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Damen, D., Doughty, H., Farinella, G. M., Fidler, S., Furnari, A., Kazakos, E., Moltisanti, D., Munro, J., Perrett, T., Price, W., & Wray, M. (2018). Scaling egocentric vision: The epic-kitchens dataset. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2018.

With these citations, I can now compile the dataset entries for both datasets, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the necessary information about the datasets used in the research paper.
