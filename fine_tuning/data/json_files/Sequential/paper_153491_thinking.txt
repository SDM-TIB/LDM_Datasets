To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comparative Analysis of Forecasting Financial Time Series Using ARIMA, LSTM, and BiLSTM" by Sima Siami-Namini et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (LSTM vs. BiLSTM: An Experimental Study)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they partially reused previously collected data from Yahoo Finance, which includes various stock indices and their respective time series data.

The paper lists the following datasets:

1. **Nikkei 225 index (N225)**: Monthly data.
2. **NASDAQ composite index (IXIC)**: Daily, weekly, and monthly data.
3. **Hang Seng Index (HSI)**: Monthly data.
4. **S&P 500 commodity price index (GSPC)**: Daily and monthly data.
5. **Dow Jones industrial average index (DJ)**: Daily, weekly, and monthly data.
6. **IBM Stock data**: Daily data collected from July 2009 to July 2019.

In **Table I**, the authors provide statistics about the number of observations for each dataset, which further confirms the datasets' relevance and usage in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to their previous work for the dataset collection, which is crucial for proper citation.

The citation for the previously collected data is:
- Siami-Namini, S., Tavakoli, N., & Siami Namin, A. (2018). "A Comparison of ARIMA and LSTM in Forecasting Time Series." In Proceedings of the 17th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA), pp. 1394-1401. IEEE.

This citation will be used for all datasets derived from this previous work.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and the citation for the source of the data.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing.
