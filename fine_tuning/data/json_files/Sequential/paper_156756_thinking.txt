To extract datasets from the research paper titled "COVE: Unleashing the Diffusion Feature Correspondence for Consistent Video Editing" by Jiangshan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of video editing and the use of diffusion models but does not specify any datasets.

I will then look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to see if the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention that they selected **23 videos from social media platforms such as TikTok and other publicly available sources** for their experiments. However, they do not provide specific dataset names or citations.

Since the paper does not provide formal datasets with citations, I will check the **References section** for any relevant sources that might be considered datasets. The references include links to Pexels and Pixabay, which are platforms for free stock videos and images. However, these are not formal datasets with specific citations.

Given that the paper does not provide specific datasets with full citations, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Source Videos**: The authors used a collection of 23 videos sourced from social media platforms, specifically TikTok and other publicly available sources. However, no formal dataset name or citation is provided.

Since there are no formal datasets with citations in the paper, I will note that the authors utilized videos from general sources without specific dataset references. 

In conclusion, I will document the findings regarding the datasets used in the paper, emphasizing the lack of formal dataset citations while acknowledging the sources of the videos used for experimentation.
