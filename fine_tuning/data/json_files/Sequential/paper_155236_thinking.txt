To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Secondary Use of Clinical Problem List Entries for Neural Network-Based Disease Code Assignment" by Markus Kreuzthaler et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors explored automated coding of clinical problem list entries using ICD-10 codes, suggesting that a dataset related to clinical problem lists is involved.

Next, in the **introduction**, the authors describe the clinical information system that stores short clinical problem descriptions along with ICD-10 codes. This hints at the existence of a dataset, but I need to find specific details.

In **section 2.1 (Data Set)**, the authors provide clear information about the dataset used: they mention using approximately **1.9 million unique de-identified problem list entries** that include ICD codes. They also describe how they prepared the dataset for training and testing, indicating that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the ICD-10 classification system, as it is a key component of the dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, but they reference the ICD-10 codes, which are standardized and widely recognized.

The citation for the ICD-10 classification system is:
> World Health Organization. *International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10)*. 10th Revision, 2016.

Since the dataset is derived from clinical problem list entries and the ICD-10 codes, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Clinical Problem List Entries Dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately 1.9 million unique de-identified problem list entries that are associated with ICD-10 codes. The dataset is used for training neural network models for disease code assignment.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name and its citation. This will ensure that the information is clear and ready for further processing or review.
