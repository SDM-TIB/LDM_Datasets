To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generic Neural Architecture Search via Regression" by Yuhong Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method, GenNAS, across various CNN and NLP search spaces, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention conducting experiments on **NASBench-101**, **NASBench-201**, and **Neural Design Spaces (NDS)**. I will note these datasets as they are crucial for understanding the context of the experiments.

I will also check the **related work** section to see if any other datasets are referenced in the context of previous research. This could provide additional context or datasets that are commonly used in the field.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is critical for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

The citations I will look for include:
- For **NASBench-101**, the citation is:
  > Ying, C., Klein, A., Christiansen, E., Real, E., Murphy, K., & Hutter, F. (2019). *NAS-Bench-101: Towards reproducible neural architecture search*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML).

- For **NASBench-201**, the citation is:
  > Dong, X., & Yang, Y. (2020). *NAS-Bench-201: Extending the scope of reproducible neural architecture search*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2001.00326.

- For **Neural Design Spaces (NDS)**, the citation is:
  > Radosavovic, I., Johnson, J., Xie, S., Lo, W.-Y., & Doll√°r, P. (2019). *On network design spaces for visual recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its full citation. This will ensure that the information is organized and easily accessible for future reference or analysis.
