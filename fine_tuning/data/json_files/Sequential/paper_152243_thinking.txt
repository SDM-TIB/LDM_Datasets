To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Domain Generation Algorithms with Long Short-Term Memory Networks" by Jonathan Woodbridge et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted using "open datasets," which indicates that specific datasets are likely referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the **experimental setup** and **data** subsections. Here, the authors explicitly state the sources of their datasets:

1. **Alexa Top 1 Million Domains**: This dataset is used for training domains that are not generated by DGAs. It is a well-known dataset that contains the most popular websites based on traffic.

2. **OSINT DGA Feed from Bambenek Consulting**: This dataset consists of approximately 750,000 DGA examples from thirty different families of malware. It is crucial for the experiments as it provides the DGA domains that the authors aim to classify.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Alexa Top 1 Million Domains**, the citation is:
  > Alexa. "Alexa Top 1 Million Domains." [Online]. Available: https://support.alexa.com/hc/en-us/articles/200449834-Does-Alexa-have-a-list-of-its-top-ranked-websites-. Accessed: 2023-10-06.

- For the **OSINT DGA Feed from Bambenek Consulting**, the citation is:
  > Bambenek Consulting. "Master Feeds." [Online]. Available: http://osint.bambenekconsulting.com/feeds/. Accessed: 2023-10-06.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective sources.
