To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neutron: An Implementation of the Transformer Translation Model and its Variants" by Hongfei Xu and Qiuhui Liu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the implementation of the Transformer model and its variants but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (which is likely to contain information about datasets used for evaluation). In this paper, the authors mention testing their implementation on the **WMT 14 English to German news translation task**. This indicates that the WMT 14 dataset is likely used, but I need to confirm this by checking the details in the relevant sections.

I will also look for any specific **data cleaning or processing sections** that might mention datasets used for training or validation. The paper discusses various features and tools for data processing, but it does not provide explicit details about additional datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the WMT 14 dataset. The WMT (Workshop on Machine Translation) datasets are commonly referenced in the literature, and I will ensure to provide the correct citation.

The citation for the WMT 14 dataset is:
> Bojar, O., et al. (2014). *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 1â€“30.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the WMT 14 dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
