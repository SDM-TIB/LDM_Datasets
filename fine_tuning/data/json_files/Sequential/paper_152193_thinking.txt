To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parallel Long Short-Term Memory for Multi-Stream Classification" by Mohamed Bouaziz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed PLSTM method is evaluated on a telecast genre classification task, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Protocol)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **section 4.1**, they specifically mention the **Multichannel EPG dataset**, which is extracted from four French TV channels (M6, TF1, France 5, and TV5 Monde) over three years (January 2013 to December 2015). This dataset is crucial for their experiments, as it serves as the basis for evaluating the PLSTM architecture.

I will gather detailed information about the dataset, including its composition and how it was split into training, validation, and test sets. The authors provide a breakdown of the genres and their distribution across these sets, which is important for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is derived from TV programs, it may not have a formal citation like other datasets. However, I will note the details provided in the paper regarding its source and usage.

The citation for the dataset can be summarized as follows:
- **Multichannel EPG Dataset**: The dataset is derived from the Electronic Program Guide (EPG) of four French TV channels (M6, TF1, France 5, and TV5 Monde) covering three years of programming. The authors do not provide a formal citation for this dataset, but they describe its creation and usage in detail within the paper.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and any relevant details that reflect its usage in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for structured output, ensuring that it is ready for review or further processing.
