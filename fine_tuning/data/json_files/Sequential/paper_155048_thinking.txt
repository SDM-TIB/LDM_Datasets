To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Information Elevation Network for Fast Online Action Detection" by Sunah Min and Jinyoung Moon, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information accurately, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method was evaluated on two benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section**, specifically **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors provide an overview of the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **THUMOS-14**: This dataset is described as being initially publicized for a competition for offline action detection and localization, consisting of videos from YouTube, divided into 20 action classes related to sports.

2. **TVSeries**: This dataset consists of 27 episodes from six famous TV series, containing a total of 6,231 action instances over 30 classes.

I will also check the **evaluation metrics** section to confirm that these datasets are indeed used for the evaluation of the proposed method, which I find is the case.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For **THUMOS-14**, the citation is:
  > Y. G. Jiang, J. Liu, A. Roshan Zamir, G. Toderici, I. Laptev, M. Shah, and R. Sukthankar. *Thumos challenge: Action recognition with a large number of classes*. 2014. http://crcv.ucf.edu/THUMOS14/.

- For **TVSeries**, the citation is:
  > R. De Geest, E. Gavves, A. Ghodrati, Z. Li, C. Snoek, and T. Tuytelaars. *Online action detection*. In European Conference on Computer Vision. Springer, 2016, pp. 269â€“284.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets utilized in the research.
