To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Video Person Re-identification by Temporal Residual Learning" by Ju Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention four datasets:

1. **MARS Dataset**: This dataset is described as a large-scale video dataset for person re-identification, captured from six near-synchronized cameras. It contains 1,261 different identities and a total of 20,478 tracklets.

2. **PRID 2011 Dataset**: This dataset consists of images captured by two static non-overlapping surveillance cameras, with 385 identities in one view and 749 in the other. It has an overlap of 200 pedestrians.

3. **ILIDS-VID Dataset**: Captured in an airport arrival hall, this dataset includes 300 distinct individuals observed in two non-overlapping views, forming 600 pedestrian sequences.

4. **SDU-VID Dataset**: This dataset contains 600 pedestrian sequences for 300 different identities, collected by two non-overlapping camera views in outdoor scenes.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **MARS Dataset**:
  > Zhi, L., & Wang, S. (2016). MARS: A video benchmark for large-scale person re-identification. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision.

- For **PRID 2011 Dataset**:
  > Hirzer, M., Beleznai, C., Roth, P. M., & Bischof, H. (2011). Person re-identification by descriptive and discriminative classification.

- For **ILIDS-VID Dataset**:
  > Liu, K., Ma, B., Zhang, W., & Huang, R. (2015). A spatio-temporal appearance representation for video-based pedestrian re-identification. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision.

- For **SDU-VID Dataset**:
  > Zhang, W., Ma, B., Liu, K., & Huang, R. (2017). Video-based pedestrian re-identification by adaptive spatio-temporal appearance model. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately and can be easily referenced in future work.
