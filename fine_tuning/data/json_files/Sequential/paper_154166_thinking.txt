To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Minimize Exposure Bias of Seq2Seq Models in Joint Entity and Relation Extraction" by Ranran Haoran Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly named or described. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their model on **two datasets, DuIE and NYT**, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look closely at the **introduction** to confirm the datasets mentioned. The authors state that they evaluate their model on **NYT** and **DuIE**, providing a clear indication of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, specifically section 3.1, the authors provide additional context about the datasets. They describe **NYT** as an English news dataset generated by distant supervision without manual annotation, widely used in joint entity and relation extraction studies. They also mention **DuIE** as a large-scale Chinese dataset for joint entity and relation extraction, with sentences sourced from Baidu Baike.

The paper also includes a **data statistics table** (Table 2) that provides further details about the datasets, including the number of sentences and triplets in each dataset. This information is essential for understanding the datasets' scope and scale.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **NYT dataset**, the citation is:
   > Riedel, S., Yao, L., & McCallum, A. (2010). Modeling relations and their mentions without labeled text. In Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases (pp. 148-163). Springer.

2. For the **DuIE dataset**, the citation is:
   > Li, S., He, W., Shi, Y., Jiang, W., Liang, H., Jiang, Y., Zhang, Y., & Zhu, Y. (2019). DuIE: A large-scale Chinese dataset for information extraction. In CCF International Conference on Natural Language Processing and Chinese Computing (pp. 791-800). Springer.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
