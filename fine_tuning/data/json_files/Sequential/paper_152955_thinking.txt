To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RWTH ASR Systems for LibriSpeech: Hybrid vs Attention" by Christoph LÃ¼scher et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors are working with the **LibriSpeech task**, which suggests that the LibriSpeech dataset is a primary dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experimental setup** section, which is likely to provide detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, the authors explicitly state that they trained their systems on the **960h training data from the LibriSpeech corpus** and also mention a **100h subset** of the LibriSpeech training corpus. This confirms that both the full LibriSpeech dataset and its subset are utilized.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citation for the LibriSpeech dataset is:

- For **LibriSpeech**:
  > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *LibriSpeech: An ASR Corpus Based on Public Domain Audio Books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), Brisbane, Australia, April 2015.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **LibriSpeech Dataset**: This dataset is a large corpus of English read speech data derived from the LibriVox project, consisting of various audio recordings and their corresponding transcriptions. It is used for training and evaluating automatic speech recognition systems.

2. **LibriSpeech 100h Subset**: This is a smaller subset of the full LibriSpeech dataset, specifically designed for experiments that require less data while still providing a representative sample for training and evaluation.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have the full citations ready for each dataset, as they are crucial for proper attribution in any downstream processing or reporting.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or utilized in further analyses.
