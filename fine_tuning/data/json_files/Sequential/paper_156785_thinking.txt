To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Sectoral Profitability in the Indian Stock Market Using Deep Learning" by Jaydip Sen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions the use of historical stock prices of **180 stocks across 18 sectors listed on the NSE, India**, which indicates that this is a significant dataset for the study.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the **Data Acquisition and Loading** subsection. Here, the authors describe how they extracted historical stock data from the **Yahoo Finance website** using stock ticker names, specifying the time frame from **January 1, 2005, to April 23, 2024**. This provides a clear indication of the dataset's source and the time period covered.

I will also check the **results section**, where the authors present detailed analyses of various sectors and their respective stocks. Each sector's performance is summarized, indicating that the dataset includes not only stock prices but also profit calculations and sectoral averages.

In the **conclusion**, the authors reiterate the use of the dataset for predicting stock prices and analyzing sector profitability, confirming its importance in the study.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets:

1. **Historical Stock Prices Dataset**: This dataset includes historical stock prices for **180 stocks** across **18 sectors** listed on the **NSE, India**, covering the period from **January 1, 2005, to April 23, 2024**. The data was extracted from **Yahoo Finance**.

2. **Sectoral Performance Data**: This dataset summarizes the performance of stocks within each of the **18 sectors**, detailing metrics such as buy/sell profits and gross profits normalized by mean prices.

Next, I will look for full citations for the datasets mentioned. Since the paper primarily references the **Yahoo Finance** as the source for the stock data, I will note that as the citation for the historical stock prices dataset.

The citation for the Yahoo Finance dataset is:
> Yahoo Finance. *Yahoo Finance Stock Data*. Retrieved from http://finance.yahoo.com (Accessed on April 23, 2024).

Now, I will summarize the datasets with their respective citations:

- **Historical Stock Prices Dataset**: 
  - Source: Yahoo Finance
  - Citation: Yahoo Finance. *Yahoo Finance Stock Data*. Retrieved from http://finance.yahoo.com (Accessed on April 23, 2024).

- **Sectoral Performance Data**: 
  - This dataset is derived from the analysis conducted in the paper and does not have a separate citation as it is part of the study's findings.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare to format it according to the required structure for further processing or review.
