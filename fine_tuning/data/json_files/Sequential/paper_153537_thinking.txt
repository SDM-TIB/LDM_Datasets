To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A limited-size ensemble of homogeneous CNN/LSTMs for high-performance word classification" by Mahya Ameryan and Lambert Schomaker, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that two datasets are used for evaluation: the **RIMES dataset** and the **KdK dataset**. This is a good starting point.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Results)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find the following information:

1. **RIMES Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 51,738 images of French handwriting for training, 7,464 images for validation, and 7,776 images for testing. It consists of 12,723 pages written by 1,300 volunteers. The dictionary size for the training set is 4,943 words.

2. **KdK Dataset**: This dataset is from the National Archive of the Netherlands and contains 172,440 word images. It includes 11,749 word classes, with a dictionary size of 12,000 words for the Concise dictionary and 384,000 words for the Large dictionary.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **RIMES dataset**, the citation is:
  > Grosicki, E., Carre, M., Geoﬀrois, E., & Augustin, E. (2006). La campagne d’évaluation RIMES pour la reconnaissance de courriers manuscrits. In Actes Colloque International Francophone sur l’Ecrit et le Document (CIFED’06), Fribourg, Switzerland, pp. 61–66.

- For the **KdK dataset**, the citation is:
  > Van der Zant, T., Schomaker, L., & Haak, K. (2008). Handwritten-word spotting using biologically inspired features. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 30(11), 1945–1957.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the paper.
