To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodal Learning for Cardiovascular Risk Prediction using EHR Data" by Ayoub Bagheri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the integration of structured clinical information and unstructured medical texts, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention using data from the **SMART study**, which is a cohort study involving patients with manifest vascular disease or at high risk for cardiovascular disease. This indicates that the SMART study dataset is likely a primary dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look into **section 3.1 (Cohort Study)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the SMART study. They mention that the dataset includes **5603 patients** and their reports, which confirms that this is a significant dataset for their analysis. The characteristics of the patients and the variables extracted for the study are also detailed, which further emphasizes the dataset's relevance.

In the **experiments section**, the authors evaluate their model's performance using the data from the SMART study, reinforcing that this dataset is central to their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SMART study. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For the **SMART study**, the citation is:
  > Petronella Cornelia Gerarda Simons, A Algra, MF Van de Laak, DE Grobbee, and Y Van der Graaf. *Second manifestations of ARTerial disease (SMART) study: Rationale and design*. European journal of epidemiology 15, 9 (1999), 773â€“781.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the SMART study dataset, I will create an entry for this dataset.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness.
