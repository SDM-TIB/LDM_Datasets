To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Business Metric-Aware Forecasting for Inventory Management" by Helen Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors explore various cost trade-off scenarios and empirically demonstrate the benefits of their method on different datasets. This indicates that there are datasets used in their experiments, which I need to identify.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.5 (Data)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets they used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **M3 Monthly Industry Subset**: This dataset consists of 334 univariate time-series with up to 144 time points, collected on a monthly basis. It serves as a proxy for demand on a monthly basis.

2. **Favorita Grocery Sales**: This dataset includes sales data across several stores and products, with covariates such as oil prices and holidays. It consists of 90,193 distinct time-series with up to 396 time points, collected daily from 2015 to 2016.

To confirm the details of these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **M3 Monthly Industry Subset**, the citation is:
  > Makridakis, S. and Hibon, M. (2000). The M3-Competition: results, conclusions and implications. *International Journal of Forecasting*, 16(4):451–476.

- For the **Favorita Grocery Sales**, the citation is:
  > Favorita (2017). Corporación Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, ensuring to include their names, descriptions, and full citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
