To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ACTION2SCORE: AN EMBEDDING APPROACH TO SCORE PLAYER ACTION" by Junho Jang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset they collected. In this section, they mention that they collected **245,575 match data of League of Legends** using the RiotAPI. This is a significant dataset, and I will note the details provided about it.

The authors specify that the dataset includes matches from **North America, Europe, South Korea, and Japan**, played between May 10 and 17, 2021. They also describe the structure of the dataset, which consists of two JSON files: one for match metadata and another for timeline data. The metadata includes basic information about the game, while the timeline data contains significant events reported at one-minute intervals.

Now, I will extract the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the RiotAPI as the source of their dataset. Therefore, I will format the citation as follows:

- For the **League of Legends match data**, the citation is:
  > Riot Games. *Riot Developer Portal*. Available at: [https://developer.riotgames.com/](https://developer.riotgames.com/).

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, including the number of matches, the regions covered, and the time frame of the data collection.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that all information is accurate and complete for future reference.
