To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cell-aware Stacked LSTMs for Modeling Sentences" by Jihun Choi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on multiple benchmark tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using the **SNLI** and **MultiNLI** datasets for natural language inference tasks, and the **Quora Question Pairs** dataset for paraphrase identification. I will note down these datasets and any details provided about them.

In section 4.1, the authors describe the **SNLI dataset** as containing approximately 570,000 premise-hypothesis pairs, and the **MultiNLI dataset** as having around 430,000 pairs. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scale and purpose.

In section 4.2, the **Quora Question Pairs dataset** is mentioned, which consists of over 400,000 question pairs annotated for paraphrasing. This detail will also be recorded.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and will provide context for the datasets used in the experiments.

The full citations I will extract are:

1. For the **SNLI dataset**:
   > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In EMNLP, pages 632–642, 2015.

2. For the **MultiNLI dataset**:
   > Adina Williams, Nikita Nangia, and Samuel Bowman. *A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference*. In NAACL-HLT, pages 1112–1122, 2018.

3. For the **Quora Question Pairs dataset**:
   > Wang, W., et al. *Quora Question Pairs*. 2017. (Note: The exact citation format may vary; I will ensure to format it correctly based on the paper's reference style.)

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
