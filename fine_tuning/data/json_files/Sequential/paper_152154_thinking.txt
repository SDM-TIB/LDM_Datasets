To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conversation Modeling on Reddit using a Graph-Structured LSTM" by Vicky Zayats and Mari Ostendorf, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the model is evaluated on Reddit discussions, which suggests that the datasets used are related to Reddit comments. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors describe the data used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three specific subreddits: **askwomen**, **askmen**, and **politics**. They provide statistics about the number of comments, threads, and vocabulary size for each subreddit, which indicates that these subreddits are the datasets used in their study.

I will also check the **data statistics table (Table 1)**, which summarizes the datasets:
- **askwomen**: 0.8 million comments, 3.5K threads, vocabulary size of 32K.
- **askmen**: 1.1 million comments, 4.5K threads, vocabulary size of 35K.
- **politics**: 2.2 million comments, 4.9K threads, vocabulary size of 55K.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** for these datasets in the **References section**. However, since these datasets are derived from Reddit, I will note that the citation for the Reddit platform itself is relevant. The authors do not provide specific citations for the subreddits, but I can reference the general Reddit platform as follows:

- For the Reddit datasets, the citation is:
  > Reddit. *reddit.com*. Accessed [insert access date].

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant details and citations for each dataset. 

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **askwomen subreddit**: 0.8 million comments, 3.5K threads, vocabulary size of 32K.
   - Citation: Reddit. *reddit.com*. Accessed [insert access date].
   
2. **askmen subreddit**: 1.1 million comments, 4.5K threads, vocabulary size of 35K.
   - Citation: Reddit. *reddit.com*. Accessed [insert access date].
   
3. **politics subreddit**: 2.2 million comments, 4.9K threads, vocabulary size of 55K.
   - Citation: Reddit. *reddit.com*. Accessed [insert access date].

After gathering all this information, I will format it appropriately for further processing or review.
