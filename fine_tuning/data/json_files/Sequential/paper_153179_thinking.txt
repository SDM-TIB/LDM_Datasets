To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond English-Only Reading Comprehension: Experiments in Zero-Shot Multilingual Transfer for Bulgarian" by Momchil Hardalov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions a new dataset for Bulgarian reading comprehension, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Data)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets they created and used. Here, I will look for specific names, descriptions, and any statistics related to the datasets. The authors mention a new dataset containing 2,636 multiple-choice questions from various subjects, which is crucial information.

In this section, I will also note the breakdown of the dataset by subject, which includes:
- **12th Grade Matriculation Exam**: Questions from exams created by the Ministry of Education in Bulgaria.
- **Online History Quizzes**: Additional questions sourced from online quizzes.

I will also check the **experiments** section to see if any other datasets are referenced or utilized in the experiments, particularly those that may have been used for training or evaluation purposes.

After gathering all relevant information, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the **RACE dataset**, which is a significant dataset for reading comprehension tasks. The citation for RACE is:
> Guokun Lai, Qizhe Xie, Hanxiao Liu, Yiming Yang, and Eduard Hovy. *RACE: Large-scale ReAding comprehension dataset from examinations*. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 785â€“794, 2017.

For the newly proposed Bulgarian dataset, since it is created by the authors themselves, I will note that it does not have a formal citation yet, but I will document it as follows:
- **Bulgarian Reading Comprehension Dataset**: Contains 2,636 multiple-choice questions from 12th grade matriculation exams and online quizzes.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that full citations are provided where applicable. This will ensure that the information is ready for further processing or review.
