To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancement of Spatial Clustering-Based Time-Frequency Masks Using LSTM Neural Networks" by Felix Grezes et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors compare their proposed system to several baselines on the **CHiME-3 dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (The CHiME-3 Corpus)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the CHiME-3 dataset. They mention that it features both live and simulated 6-channel recordings from 12 different speakers in various noisy environments. This section confirms that the CHiME-3 dataset is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CHiME-3 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **CHiME-3 dataset**:
  > Jon Barker, Ricard Marxer, Emmanuel Vincent, and Shinji Watanabe. *The third chime speech separation and recognition challenge: Dataset, task and baselines*. In Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding (ASRU), 2015 IEEE Workshop on. IEEE, 2015, pp. 504â€“511.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will focus solely on the CHiME-3 dataset for my output.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have a complete and accurate representation of the dataset used in the research.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the CHiME-3 dataset, ensuring that it is ready for review or further processing.
