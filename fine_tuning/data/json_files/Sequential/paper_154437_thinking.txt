To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detection and Prediction of Nutrient Deficiency Stress using Longitudinal Aerial Imagery" by Saba Dadsetan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors will release a dataset that could benefit various fields, which suggests that there is a specific dataset being discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods** section, particularly the **Data Collection** and **Annotation and Dataset Construction** subsections. Here, the authors describe their data collection process, which involves capturing high-resolution aerial imagery across multiple flights. They mention that they annotated images from 670 farm parcels for regions of nutrient deficiency stress (NDS), which indicates that this annotated dataset is crucial for their research.

In the **Results** section, I will look for any references to the performance of models using this dataset, as this can provide additional context about its significance and usage.

The authors explicitly state that they will release three flights from the 386 farm parcels, along with the ground-truth mask for the final flight. This indicates that there are specific datasets being released, which I need to document.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors mention that the dataset will be released on the Registry of Open Data on AWS under the title "Longitudinal Nutrient Deficiency." However, they do not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself in the references, which is common for datasets that are hosted online.

To summarize, the key dataset I will extract is:

1. **Longitudinal Nutrient Deficiency Dataset**: This dataset consists of high-resolution aerial imagery collected from 386 farm parcels, annotated for regions of nutrient deficiency stress. The dataset includes ground-truth masks for the final flight of each parcel.

Since the authors did not provide a formal citation in the references, I will note the dataset's title and the fact that it will be available on the Registry of Open Data on AWS.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their significance in the context of the research.
