To extract datasets from the research paper titled "C-LSTM: Enabling Efficient LSTM using Structured Compression Techniques on FPGAs" by Shuo Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can hint at their use. The introduction often discusses the context of the research and may reference specific datasets used in prior work.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and how they were utilized in the experiments. For instance, if the authors mention a dataset like "TIMIT" or "Google LSTM," I will note these down.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **TIMIT dataset** for evaluating their LSTM model. I will extract the relevant details about this dataset, including its purpose and characteristics as described in the paper.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For the **TIMIT dataset**, the citation is:
> John S. Garofolo, Lori F. Lamel, William M. Fisher, Jonathon G. Fiscus, and David S. Pallett. *DARPA TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus CD-ROM*. NIST Speech Disc 1-1.1. NASA STI/Recon Technical Report N, 1993.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for hints about datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for explicit mentions of datasets.
3. Note down the details of the **TIMIT dataset** as it is the primary dataset referenced.
4. Retrieve the full citation from the References section.
5. Compile the information for clarity and accuracy.
