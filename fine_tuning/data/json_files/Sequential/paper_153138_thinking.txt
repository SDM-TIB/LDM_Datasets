To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fused Detection of Retinal Biomarkers in OCT Volumes" by Thomas Kurmann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on a dataset of **416 volumes**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors provide detailed information about their dataset. In this section, they describe their dataset as consisting of **416 volumes** originating from **327 individuals** with Age-Related Macular Degeneration and Diabetic Retinopathy. Each volume contains **49 slices**, leading to a total of **20,384 slices**. They also mention that trained annotators provided slice-level annotations for **11 common biomarkers**.

I will list the biomarkers mentioned in the paper, as they are part of the dataset's description:

1. Subretinal Fluid (SRF)
2. Interetinal Fluid (IRF)
3. Hyperreflective Foci (HF)
4. Drusen
5. Reticular Pseudodrusen (RPD)
6. Epiretinal Membrane (ERM)
7. Geographic Atrophy (GA)
8. Outer Retinal Atrophy (ORA)
9. Intraretinal Cysts (IRC)
10. Fibrovascular PED (FPED)
11. Healthy

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, as it appears to be a novel dataset created by the authors for their study. Therefore, I will create a citation based on the information provided in the paper:

- **Dataset Citation**:
  > Kurmann, T., Marquez-Neila, P., Yu, S., Munk, M., Wolf, S., & Sznitman, R. (2023). *Fused Detection of Retinal Biomarkers in OCT Volumes*. University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that it is clearly structured for any downstream processing or review.

In summary, I have identified the dataset as consisting of **416 OCT volumes** with annotations for **11 biomarkers**, and I have created a citation for it based on the authors and the title of the paper.
