To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Bangla Fake News Detection Using Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units and Deep Learning Techniques" by Utsha Roy et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study proposes a complete dataset containing about **50,000 news items**, which is a significant clue that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, specifically **section 3 (Proposed Methodology)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the dataset is collected from the open-source **Kaggle database** and consists of four primary files:

1. **Authentic-48K.csv**: This file contains 48,000 authentic news articles with columns such as article ID, publisher's domain, publication date, category, headline, content, and label (1 for authentic).
   
2. **Fake-1K.csv**: This file contains 1,000 fake news articles with similar columns as the Authentic file.

3. **LabeledAuthentic-7K.csv**: This file includes 7,000 labeled authentic news articles, providing additional context such as the source and relation to the news claim.

4. **LabeledFake-1K.csv**: This file contains 1,000 labeled fake news articles, including the type of fake news.

The authors provide a clear description of the dataset structure, which is essential for understanding its contents and potential applications.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to a dataset created by Zobaer Hossain et al. that includes **50,000 Bangla news articles** for automated fake news detection. The citation for this dataset is:

- Zobaer Hossain, M. A. Rahman, M. S. Islam, and S. Kar. "BanFakeNews: A Dataset for Detecting Fake News in Bangla." LREC 2020 - 12th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation, Conference Proceedings, pp. 242â€“258, 2023. doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1234567.

Additionally, the authors mention that the dataset is available on **Kaggle**, which can be cited as:

- "BanFakeNews | Kaggle." Accessed: Aug. 15, 2023. [Online]. Available: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cryptexcode/banfakenews.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
