To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FSNet: Compression of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks by Filter Summary" by Yingzhen Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and prior work, which might include references to datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for image classification tasks and the **ILSVRC-12 dataset** for large-scale image classification. These are key datasets that I need to document.

In the **CIFAR-10 section**, the authors state that they used it for comparative results between FSNet and its baseline CNN. They provide details about the performance metrics achieved on this dataset, which confirms its use in their experiments.

For the **ILSVRC-12 dataset**, the authors mention its use in evaluating FSNet's performance on a larger scale, specifically using ResNet-50 as the baseline. This dataset is also crucial for documenting.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, 2009.

2. **ILSVRC-12 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael S. Bernstein, Alexander C. Berg, and Fei-Fei Li. *Imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the requirements. This will involve creating a structured output that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations for each dataset used in the paper.
