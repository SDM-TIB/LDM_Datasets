To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Sketch-Based System for Semantic Parsing" by Zechang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present a semantic parsing system evaluated on a dataset from the NLPCC 2019 evaluation task, which suggests that a specific dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Data Analyzation)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention the **MSParS dataset**, which consists of 81,826 samples annotated by native English speakers. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets, with specific metrics for evaluation. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm that the MSParS dataset is indeed used for evaluation. The authors discuss their results based on this dataset, which reinforces its significance in their research.

Now, I need to gather the full citation for the MSParS dataset. Since the dataset is published as part of the NLPCC 2019 evaluation task, I will look for the appropriate reference in the **References section**. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, as it is part of the NLPCC conference proceedings. Therefore, I will cite it as follows:

- For **MSParS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > NLPCC 2019 Evaluation Task on Open Domain Semantic Parsing. In Proceedings of the 2019 Natural Language Processing and Chinese Computing (NLPCC), 2019.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and citation in a structured format, ensuring that I include all necessary information for clarity and completeness.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured output that is ready for review or further processing.
