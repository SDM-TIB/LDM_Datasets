To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Recurrent Models with Fast-Forward Connections for Neural Machine Translation" by Jie Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their models on the WMT’14 English-to-French and English-to-German tasks, suggesting that these tasks are based on specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Data sets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **WMT’14 English-to-French Dataset**: This dataset comprises multiple sources, including Europarl v7, Common Crawl, UN, News Commentary, and Gigaword, totaling 36 million sentence pairs.

2. **WMT’14 English-to-German Dataset**: This dataset also includes multiple sources, specifically Europarl v7, Common Crawl, and News Commentary, with a total of 4.5 million sentence pairs.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are commonly used in the field, they may not have formal citations in the same way that research papers do. Instead, I will note the sources mentioned in the paper:

- For the **WMT’14 English-to-French Dataset**, the sources are:
  - Europarl v7
  - Common Crawl
  - UN
  - News Commentary
  - Gigaword

- For the **WMT’14 English-to-German Dataset**, the sources are:
  - Europarl v7
  - Common Crawl
  - News Commentary

Since these datasets are widely recognized and used in the machine translation community, I will provide a general citation format for the WMT datasets based on their common usage:

- For the **WMT’14 English-to-French Dataset**:
  > Buck, C., Heafield, K., & van Ooyen, B. (2014). N-gram counts and language models from the common crawl. In Proceedings of the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference.

- For the **WMT’14 English-to-German Dataset**:
  > Buck, C., Heafield, K., & van Ooyen, B. (2014). N-gram counts and language models from the common crawl. In Proceedings of the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the names, descriptions, and citations for each dataset in a structured format for further processing.
