To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rail Crack Propagation Forecasting Using Multi-horizons RNNs" by Sara Yasmine OUERK et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data description sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the collection of real data on the French rail network, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data description and processing)**, where the authors categorize the collected data into four types: Infrastructure data, Traffic data, Environment data, and Defect data. This section provides a detailed description of the types of data collected but does not explicitly name any datasets. However, it indicates that the data is derived from the French rail network, which is crucial for understanding the context.

I will also look for any specific datasets mentioned in the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors discuss the data preparation for learning and the models used. They mention that the dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets, but again, they do not specify any named datasets.

Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset names, I will check the **References section** to see if any external datasets are cited that may have been used in the study. However, the references primarily cite works related to methodologies and previous studies rather than specific datasets.

Given the lack of explicit dataset names in the paper, I will summarize the types of data collected and their significance, but I will note that no specific datasets were cited. The data is primarily derived from the French rail network, focusing on crack propagation, which is critical for the study's objectives.

In conclusion, while I cannot provide full citations for specific datasets due to their absence in the paper, I will document the types of data collected and their relevance to the research. If any datasets were mentioned in the references, I would include those citations as well.

Now, I will compile the findings into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
