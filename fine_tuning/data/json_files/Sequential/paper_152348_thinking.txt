To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Memory Networks for Natural Language Processing" by Ankit Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the DMN achieves state-of-the-art results on several tasks and datasets, specifically mentioning **Facebook’s bAbI dataset**, **Stanford Sentiment Treebank**, and **WSJ-PTB**. This gives me a clear starting point for the datasets I need to extract.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors discuss the datasets used for various tasks. In **section 4.1**, they describe the **bAbI dataset** as a synthetic dataset for testing question answering models, which is crucial for understanding the capabilities of the DMN. 

In **section 4.2**, the authors mention the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank**, which is used for sentiment analysis. They provide details about its structure and the tasks performed on it, confirming its relevance as a dataset.

In **section 4.3**, the **WSJ-PTB** (Wall Street Journal Penn Treebank) is discussed in the context of part-of-speech tagging, providing additional context for its use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

1. **Facebook’s bAbI dataset**:
   > Weston, J., Bordes, A., Chopra, S., & Mikolov, T. (2015). *Towards AI-complete question answering: A set of prerequisite toy tasks*. CoRR, abs/1502.05698.

2. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank**:
   > Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J., Chuang, J., Manning, C., Ng, A., & Potts, C. (2013). *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In EMNLP.

3. **WSJ-PTB** (Wall Street Journal Penn Treebank):
   > Marcus, M. P., Marcinkiewicz, M. A., & Santorini, B. (1993). *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2).

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and ensure that all relevant details are captured for further processing.
