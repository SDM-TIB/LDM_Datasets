To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decomposing a Recurrent Neural Network into Modules for Enabling Reusability and Replacement" by Sayem Mohammad Imtiaz et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their approach against **five canonical datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section V), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **Math QA**: This dataset contains a series of mathematical questions, each tagged with a specific category (e.g., geometry, physics). It has a total of 6 output classes.
   
2. **Clinc OOS**: This dataset is used for intent classification in NLP, containing ten output classes.

3. **Brown Corpus**: This dataset consists of English linguistic data, with each word annotated with one of 12 part-of-speech tags.

4. **Tatoeba**: This dataset includes sentences in over 400 languages, primarily used for multilingual evaluation, with selected languages being English, Italian, German, and French.

5. **Wiki-toxicity**: This dataset contains comments from Wikipedia pages, annotated with seven toxicity labels (e.g., toxic, severe toxicity).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Math QA**, the citation is:

- For **Brown Corpus**, the citation is:

- For **Wiki-toxicity**, the citation is:
  > E. Wulczyn, N. Thain, and L. Dixon. *Ex Machina: Personal Attacks Seen at Scale*. In Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web, 2017.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured both the dataset names and their corresponding citations.
