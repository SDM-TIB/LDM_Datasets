To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep learning the Hurst parameter of linear fractional processes and assessing its reliability" by Dániel Boros et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the research involves generating extensive datasets for fractional Brownian motion (fBm) and fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (fOU) processes, which suggests that these datasets are crucial to the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe the generation of datasets for fBm and fOU processes using a Davies-Harte-type algorithm and Kroese’s method. This indicates that they have created synthetic datasets for their experiments.

In the **methodology section**, the authors mention that they generated a large number of trajectories for both fBm and fOU processes, specifically stating that they used up to 10^7 trajectories of lengths 1600 or 6400. This is important information for describing the datasets.

Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a dataset from the **NASA Prognostics Center of Excellence (PCoE)** for Li-ion battery degradation data. This dataset is explicitly referenced, and I will need to include its citation.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets:

1. **Synthetic fBm Dataset**: Generated using a Davies-Harte-type algorithm, with a focus on covering the Hurst parameter's range from 0 to 1. The dataset consists of a large number of trajectories (up to 10^7) of lengths 1600 or 6400.

2. **Synthetic fOU Dataset**: Similar to the fBm dataset, this dataset is generated using Kroese’s method and also consists of a large number of trajectories.

3. **Li-ion Battery Degradation Dataset**: This dataset is provided by the NASA Prognostics Center of Excellence and includes experiments on Li-ion batteries involving charging and discharging at different temperatures.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **NASA Li-ion Battery Dataset**, the citation is:
  > NASA Prognostics Center of Excellence (PCoE). *Li-Ion Battery Data Set*. Available at: https://www.nasa.gov/intelligent-systems-division/discovery-and-systems-health/pcoe/pcoe-data-set-repository/.

Since the synthetic datasets do not have formal citations as they are generated by the authors, I will note that they are based on the methodologies described in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and citations, ensuring that I have captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any critical information.
