To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KN O WDA: ALL-IN-ONE KNOWLEDGE MIXTURE MODEL FOR DATA AUGMENTATION IN LOW-RESOURCE NLP TASKS" by Yufei Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on several benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets mentioned in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention three specific benchmarks: **FewGLUE**, **CoNLL’03**, and **WikiAnn**. I will note these down as they are likely to be the datasets used in their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for each dataset's origin.

1. **FewGLUE**: The citation for this benchmark is:
   > Wang, A., Singh, J., Michael, J., Hill, F., Levy, O., & Bowman, S. R. (2019). GLUE: A multi-task benchmark and analysis platform for natural language understanding. In 7th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2019.

2. **CoNLL’03**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Sang, E. F., & De Meulder, F. (2003). Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 shared task: Language-independent named entity recognition. In Proceedings of the 7th Conference on Natural Language Learning (CoNLL 2003).

3. **WikiAnn**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Pan, X., Chen, D., & Ji, H. (2017). WikiAnn: A large-scale multilingual named entity recognition dataset. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2017).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations for future use or analysis.
