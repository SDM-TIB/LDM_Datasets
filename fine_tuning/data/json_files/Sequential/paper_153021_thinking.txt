To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Dual Relation Modeling for Egocentric Interaction Recognition" by Haoxin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluated their method on three egocentric interaction datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **UTokyo Paired Ego-Video (PEV) Dataset**: This dataset contains 1,226 paired egocentric videos recording dyadic human-human interactions across 8 categories. The authors note that the data is split into train-test subsets based on subject pairs.

2. **NUS First-person Interaction Dataset**: This dataset includes 152 first-person videos and 133 third-person videos of both human-human and human-object interactions. The authors evaluate their method on the first-person human-human interaction subset.

3. **JPL First-Person Interaction Dataset**: This dataset consists of 84 videos of humans interacting with a humanoid model, with a camera mounted on its head, covering 7 different interactions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **UTokyo PEV Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ryo Yonetani, Kris M. Kitani, and Yoichi Sato. *Recognizing micro-actions and reactions from paired egocentric videos*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2629–2638, 2016.

- For the **NUS First-person Interaction Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sanath Narayan, Mohan S Kankanhalli, and Kalpathi R Ramakrishnan. *Action and interaction recognition in first-person videos*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, pages 526–532, 2014.

- For the **JPL First-Person Interaction Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Michael S Ryoo and Larry Matthies. *First-person activity recognition: What are they doing to me?* In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2730–2737, 2013.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details while extracting the datasets from the paper.
