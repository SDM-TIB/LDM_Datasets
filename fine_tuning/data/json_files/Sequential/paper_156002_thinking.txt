To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spam-T5: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Few-Shot Email Spam Detection" by Maxime Labonne and Sean Moran, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their models across **four public datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. This section provides detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their names, contents, and characteristics. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Ling-Spam Dataset**: A collection of 2,893 messages, with 481 spam messages and 2,412 legitimate messages, used for spam detection experiments.

2. **SMS Spam Collection**: A dataset containing 5,574 SMS messages labeled as either ham or spam, collected from various sources, with a spam rate of approximately 13%.

3. **SpamAssassin Public Corpus**: A publicly available dataset with 6,047 messages, including a spam ratio of about 31%, divided into different categories based on difficulty.

4. **Enron Email Dataset**: A collection of over 600,000 emails from 158 employees, with a smaller version used in the study containing 33,716 emails, balanced between spam and ham.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for any future research or application.
