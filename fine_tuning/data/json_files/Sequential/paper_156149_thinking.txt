To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Dynamic Epidemiological Modelling for COVID-19 Forecasting in Multi-level Districts" by Ruhan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors have used real-world data for their modeling, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their analysis. In this paper, they mention collecting data from various countries and regions, specifically:

1. **USA**: Data collected from January 23rd to August 12th, including the number of total accumulated infection cases, recoveries, and deaths.
2. **Colombia (CO)**: Data collected from March 6th to August 11th.
3. **South Africa (ZA)**: Data collected from March 7th to August 12th.
4. **Wuhan, China (CN-WH)**: Data collected from January 24th to April 15th.
5. **Piedmont, Italy (PD)**: Data collected from February 24th to June 8th.

The authors specify that the data includes the number of total accumulated infection cases, recoveries, and deaths, which are crucial for their modeling.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are derived from publicly available data sources and not from specific publications, I will note that the data is collected from official notifications of various countries, WHO, and the National Health Commission.

The citations for the datasets can be summarized as follows:

- **USA COVID-19 Data**: Collected from official notifications from the CDC and WHO.
- **Colombia COVID-19 Data**: Collected from official notifications from the Colombian Ministry of Health.
- **South Africa COVID-19 Data**: Collected from official notifications from the South African Department of Health.
- **Wuhan, China COVID-19 Data**: Collected from the National Health Commission of China.
- **Piedmont, Italy COVID-19 Data**: Collected from the Italian Ministry of Health.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the key details and citations for each dataset used in the research.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their sources, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
