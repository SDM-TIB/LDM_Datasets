To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Estimating Demand Flexibility Using Siamese LSTM Neural Networks" by Guangchun Ruan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a model-free methodology to estimate demand flexibility, which suggests that empirical data may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **case study section** (Section V), where the authors describe four test cases based on real-world data. This section is likely to contain specific datasets used for their experiments. 

In the case study, the authors mention:

1. **Case 1**: Data from a large commercial company in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market, with price data collected from 2006 to 2008.
2. **Case 2**: Data from a building with thermal loads in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection (PJM) market, covering April 2018 to March 2020.
3. **Case 3**: Data from an industrial company with time-shiftable loads in the PJM market, similar to Case 2.
4. **Case 4**: Data from a retail company in the California market (CAISO), with price data from February 2017 to June 2019.

I will now look for the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from real-world data and not published datasets, I will note the sources of the data as described in the paper.

For **Case 1**, the data source is:
- Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market data from 2006 to 2008.

For **Case 2**, the data source is:
- Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection (PJM) market data from April 2018 to March 2020.

For **Case 3**, the data source is:
- Similar to Case 2, using PJM market data.

For **Case 4**, the data source is:
- California Independent System Operator (CAISO) market data from February 2017 to June 2019.

Since these datasets are based on real-world data collected from specific markets, I will summarize the datasets with the relevant details and their respective sources.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and sources, ensuring that I provide clear citations for each dataset as described in the paper.
