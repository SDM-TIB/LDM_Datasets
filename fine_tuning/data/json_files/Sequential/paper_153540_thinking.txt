To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Variational-Sequential Graph Autoencoder for Neural Architecture Performance Prediction" by David Friede et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the **NAS-Bench-101 dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail, particularly **section 1 (Introduction)** and **section 6 (Sampling Methods)**. In the introduction, the authors highlight the significance of the NAS-Bench-101 dataset, stating that it contains over 423k fully trained neural architectures. This confirms that NAS-Bench-101 is a key dataset used in their experiments.

In **section 6**, the authors elaborate on the NAS-Bench-101 dataset, describing its structure and the types of graphs it includes. They mention that the dataset consists of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with specific constraints, which further emphasizes its importance in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the NAS-Bench-101 dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **NAS-Bench-101**: 
  > Chris Ying, Aaron Klein, Esteban Real, Eric Christiansen, Kevin Murphy, and Frank Hutter. *NAS-Bench-101: Towards Reproducible Neural Architecture Search*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.09635, 2019.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
