To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning Architectures for FSCV, a Comparison" by Thomas Twomey et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study involves predicting neurotransmitter concentrations from labeled in vitro fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) data, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.1 (Data sets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they mention that data was collected on 76 carbon-fiber probes, with specific datasets for the neurotransmitters Dopamine (DA), Serotonin (5HT), Norepinephrine (NE), and pH. The authors describe the data collection process, including the concentrations of the neuromodulators and the pH values, which gives me a clear understanding of the datasets involved.

The datasets are as follows:

1. **Dopamine (DA) Dataset**: Contains data collected with 30 concentrations of DA ranging from 0 to 2500 nanomolar (nM).
2. **Serotonin (5HT) Dataset**: Similar to the DA dataset, it includes concentrations of 5HT, also ranging from 0 to 2500 nM.
3. **Norepinephrine (NE) Dataset**: This dataset follows the same structure as the DA and 5HT datasets.
4. **pH Dataset**: Collected with 11 pH values ranging from 7.0 to 7.8, with the concentrations of the three neuromodulators set to 0 nM.

In addition, the authors mention that the datasets contain mixture solutions where all three analytes had values of 0, 840, or 1680 nM.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The datasets are derived from the experimental setup described in the paper, but they do not appear to have separate publications. Therefore, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the datasets.

The citation for the paper is:
> Twomey, T., Barbosa, L., Lohrenz, T., & Montague, P. R. (2023). *Deep Learning Architectures for FSCV, a Comparison*. Fralin Biomedical Research Institute, Virginia Tech.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper as the source of the datasets. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
