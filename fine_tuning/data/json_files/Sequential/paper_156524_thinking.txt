To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Alignment-Enhanced Chinese Grammatical Error Corrector" by Haihui Yang and Xiaojun Quan, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **three CGEC datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Metrics)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two categories of datasets: those sourced from Chinese-as-a-Second-Language (CSL) learner texts and those from Chinese native speaker texts. 

The specific datasets mentioned are:

1. **Chinese Lang8 Dataset**: This dataset is used for training and is sourced from CSL learner texts. The authors reference Zhao et al. (2018) for this dataset.

2. **HSK Dataset**: Another dataset from CSL learner texts, referenced as Zhang (2009).

3. **MuCGEC-Dev**: This dataset is used as the development set, referenced as Zhang et al. (2022a).

4. **NLPCC18-Test**: This dataset is used as the test set, also referenced as Zhao et al. (2018).

5. **FCGEC**: This dataset is sourced from native speaker texts and is referenced as Xu et al. (2022).

6. **NaCGEC**: Another dataset from native speaker texts, referenced as Ma et al. (2022).

I will now compile the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

After gathering all this information, I will prepare to format the dataset entries according to the required structure, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
