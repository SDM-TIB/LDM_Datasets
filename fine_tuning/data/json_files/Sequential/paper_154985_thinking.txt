To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Sequence-to-Sequence Speech Synthesis Using a Hidden Semi-Markov Model Based Structured Attention Mechanism" by Yoshihiko Nankaku et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the proposed method and its evaluation but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Experimental Conditions)**, where the authors describe the experimental setup. Here, they mention using a speech database consisting of **503 Japanese sentences**, with **450 sentences used for training** and **53 sentences for testing**. This indicates that the dataset is related to speech synthesis.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset used. However, the authors do not provide a specific citation for the speech dataset they used, which is common in some papers when the dataset is well-known or publicly available.

Since the dataset is not explicitly named in the paper, I will note that the dataset consists of speech data from a single male speaker, but I cannot provide a formal citation for it. 

Now, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset:

1. **Speech Database**: The dataset consists of 503 Japanese sentences, with 450 used for training and 53 for testing. The specific citation for this dataset is not provided in the paper.

Since there is no formal citation available for the dataset, I will document the dataset description without a citation. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity, but I will refrain from including any JSON structure as per the instructions.
