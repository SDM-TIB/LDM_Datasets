To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Forecasting foreign exchange rates with regression networks tuned by Bayesian optimization" by Linwei Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and it mentions that the authors evaluated their method on several important FX rates, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges of forecasting FX rates and reference the use of historical data for their experiments. This indicates that they likely used specific datasets for their analysis.

In the **experimental validation section**, I will focus on the details provided about the datasets used. The authors mention that they used historical data covering three major FX rates: **EUR/CNY, EUR/USD, and EUR/GBP**. They specify that the data spans from January 4, 2000, to January 29, 2019, with a total of 4975 daily observations per time series. This is crucial information for identifying the datasets.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper states that the historical data for the FX rates was provided by Bloomberg, which is a key source for financial data.

The full citation for the datasets is as follows:
- **EUR/CNY, EUR/USD, and EUR/GBP**: Historical data provided by Bloomberg. The dataset spans from January 4, 2000, to January 29, 2019, with 4975 daily observations for each currency pair.

With this information, I can summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations as required. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
