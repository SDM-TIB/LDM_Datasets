To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compensation of Fiber Nonlinearities in Digital Coherent Systems Leveraging Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks" by Stavros Deligiannidis et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets or benchmarks that their work builds upon or compares against. This section often provides context for the research and may highlight relevant datasets.

I will then examine the **methodology** section, particularly any subsections that discuss the experimental setup or data collection. This is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and testing their models. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the **results section**, I will check for any additional mentions of datasets, especially if the authors discuss performance metrics or comparisons that rely on specific datasets. This can help confirm the datasets identified earlier.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "C-band and O-band transmission datasets," I will look for the original sources or papers that describe these datasets in detail. I will ensure to capture the full citation format, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections for dataset mentions.
2. Identify specific datasets and their characteristics.
3. Check the references section for full citations of the datasets.
4. Compile the dataset information for clarity and accessibility.
