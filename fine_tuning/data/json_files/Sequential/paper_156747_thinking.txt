To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hidden Holes: Topological Aspects of Language Models" by Stephen Fitz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the research. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in prior studies, which could be relevant.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** section. In this paper, the authors describe their methodology in detail, including the types of data they analyze. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets mentioned, particularly in the context of training and evaluating the models.

In the **results** section, the authors may discuss the outcomes of their experiments and the datasets used for those experiments. This section often provides insights into how the datasets were utilized and their significance to the findings.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

Based on the content of the paper, I anticipate that the following datasets may be mentioned:

1. **The Pile Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of training large language models. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Gao, L., Biderman, S., Black, S., Golding, L., Hoppe, T., Foster, C., Phang, J., He, H., Thite, A., Nabeshima, N., et al. *The Pile: An 800GB Dataset of Diverse Text for Language Modeling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2101.00027, 2020.

2. **LLaMA Dataset**: The paper mentions that LLaMA models are trained on publicly available datasets. The citation for the LLaMA model is:
   > Touvron, H., Lavril, T., Izacard, G., Martinet, X., Lachaux, M.-A., Lacroix, T., Rozi√®re, B., Goyal, N., Hambro, E., Azhar, F., et al. *LLaMA: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.13971, 2023.

3. **Synthetic Corpora**: The authors generated synthetic datasets (Zipf and Uniform) for their experiments. While these may not have formal citations, I will note their significance in the context of the study.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and understanding of the study's contributions.
