To extract datasets from the research paper titled "exploRNN: Teaching Recurrent Neural Networks through Visual Exploration" by Alex BÃ¤uerle et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section** where the authors typically describe the experimental setup. This section is crucial as it often contains explicit mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation. I will look for any specific names of datasets or descriptions that indicate the type of data used.

In this paper, the authors mention using **periodical mathematical functions and simple text snippets** as training data for their interactive visualization. This indicates that the datasets are not traditional datasets but rather generated data types designed for educational purposes.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors refer to any datasets when discussing their findings or comparing their results with other studies. This can provide additional context about the datasets used.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets. Since the paper mentions that the datasets are generated for the purpose of the study, I will note that there may not be traditional citations for these datasets. However, I will ensure to document any relevant references that support the methodology or data generation techniques used.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include full citations where applicable, even if they are not traditional datasets. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Examine the methodology section for explicit dataset descriptions.
3. Review results and discussion for any additional dataset references.
4. Check the references section for any related citations.
5. Compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring full citations are included where applicable.
