To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unveiling the Invisible: Enhanced Detection and Analysis of Deteriorated Areas in Solar PV Modules Using Unsupervised Sensing Algorithms and 3D Augmented Reality" by Adel Oulefki et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of "real-world image datasets," which indicates that there are datasets relevant to the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. In this section, the authors refer to the **Cali-Thermal Solar Panels Image database** and the **Solar Panel Infrared Images v5 dataset**. I will note the details provided about these datasets, including their purpose and characteristics.

In the **Cali-Thermal Solar Panels Image database**, the authors describe it as a comprehensive dataset that includes various test images depicting different areas of solar panel deterioration. This dataset is crucial for their segmentation and analysis methods.

The **Solar Panel Infrared Images v5 dataset** is mentioned as containing 934 images of solar panels, annotated in TensorFlow Object Detection format, and resized to a resolution of (416x416) pixels. This dataset is specifically designed for computer vision projects related to solar panel inspection and defect detection.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. For the **Cali-Thermal Solar Panels Image database**, the citation is:
   > Alfaro-Mejia, E., Loaiza-Correa, H., Franco-Mejia, E., Restrepo-Giron, A. D., & Nope-Rodriguez, S. E. (2019). Dataset for recognition of snail trails and hot spot failures in monocrystalline Si solar panels. *Data in Brief*, 26, 104441.

2. For the **Solar Panel Infrared Images v5 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Roboflow. (2023). Solar panel infrared images dataset. Retrieved from https://universe.roboflow.com/dataset/solar-panel-infrared-images-v5.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further research and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
