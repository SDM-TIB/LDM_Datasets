To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Non-linear Calculators" by Adedamola Wuraola and Nitish Patel, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used for benchmarking or evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **implementation and results sections**. These sections often contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the paper discusses any experiments or evaluations, I will pay close attention to those sections, as they typically outline the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will note any specific datasets mentioned, including their purpose and any relevant details provided by the authors.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation allows for accurate attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "MNIST dataset" for testing their activation functions, I will look for the original citation for the MNIST dataset in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

If the paper does not provide full citations for the datasets, I will conduct a quick search to find the authoritative sources for those datasets.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help me create a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further analysis or integration into a larger dataset repository.
