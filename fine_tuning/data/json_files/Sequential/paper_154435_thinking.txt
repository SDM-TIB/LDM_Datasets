To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient CNN-LSTM based Image Captioning using Neural Network Compression" by Harshit Rampal and Aman Mohanty, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the model is trained on the **flickr8k dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into the **introduction** section for more context about the dataset. The authors mention that the flickr8k dataset consists of 8,094 images, each with 5 captions. This detail is important for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

In the **method section**, the authors confirm that they trained, validated, and tested their model on the flickr8k dataset. This section provides additional insights into how the dataset was utilized in their experiments.

I will also check the **conclusion and future work sections** to see if there are any mentions of other datasets. The authors suggest that the MS-COCO dataset could be a promising choice for future work, indicating its relevance in the context of image captioning.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Flickr8k Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is commonly referenced as:
   > Young, P., Hazarika, D., Poria, S., & Cambria, E. (2018). *Towards an integrated approach to multimodal sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING 2016), pages 1-10.

2. **MS-COCO Dataset**: The citation for the MS-COCO dataset is:
   > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Doll√°r, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740-755.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
