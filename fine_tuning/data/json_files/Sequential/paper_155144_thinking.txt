To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TND-NAS: Towards Non-Differentiable Objectives in Differentiable Neural Architecture Search" by Bo Lyu and Shiping Wen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions that the experiments were conducted on **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100** datasets, which indicates that these are the primary datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (specifically section IV) where the authors discuss their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly state that they conducted experiments on **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100**. This confirms that these datasets are indeed utilized in their research.

Now, I will check the **datasets section** (section III) to gather more details about these datasets. The authors mention that both datasets are popular for image classification tasks, which aligns with their research focus.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The CIFAR datasets are well-known, and their citations are typically available in the literature. The citations for these datasets are:

- For **CIFAR10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. "Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images." 2009.

- For **CIFAR100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. "Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images." 2009.

Since both datasets are derived from the same source, I will ensure to note that they share the same citation.

Finally, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for further processing or review.
