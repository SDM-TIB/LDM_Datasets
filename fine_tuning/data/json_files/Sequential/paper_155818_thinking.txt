To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Novel Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Automated Stock Trading System Using Cascaded LSTM Networks" by Jie Zou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention using data from various stock markets, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Description of Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Dow Jones Industrial Index (DJI)**: This dataset includes 30 stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Index in the US.
2. **SSE50**: This dataset consists of 30 stocks from the SSE50 index on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in China.
3. **SENSEX**: This dataset includes 30 stocks from the SENSEX index on the Bombay Stock Exchange in India.
4. **FTSE 100**: This dataset comprises 30 stocks from the FTSE 100 index on the London Stock Exchange in the UK.

The authors also specify the time frame for the data collection, which is from **01/01/2009 to 05/08/2020**, and how the data is split into in-sample and out-of-sample periods.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. However, since the datasets are derived from well-known stock indices, I will provide the standard citations for these indices:

- For the **Dow Jones Industrial Index (DJI)**, the citation is:
  > Dow Jones & Company. "Dow Jones Industrial Average." Available at: https://www.djindexes.com/ (Accessed: [Date]).

- For the **SSE50**, the citation is:
  > Shanghai Stock Exchange. "SSE 50 Index." Available at: http://www.sse.com.cn/ (Accessed: [Date]).

- For the **SENSEX**, the citation is:
  > Bombay Stock Exchange. "SENSEX." Available at: https://www.bseindia.com/ (Accessed: [Date]).

- For the **FTSE 100**, the citation is:
  > FTSE Russell. "FTSE 100 Index." Available at: https://www.ftserussell.com/ (Accessed: [Date]).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
