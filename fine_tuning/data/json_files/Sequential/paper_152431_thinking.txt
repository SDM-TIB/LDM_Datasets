To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Representation Learning with Contrastive Predictive Coding" by Aaron van den Oord et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors apply their method to "four distinct domains: speech, images, text, and reinforcement learning." This indicates that there are likely datasets associated with each of these domains.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The paper is structured into subsections for each domain, so I will focus on the following subsections:

1. **3.1 Audio**: Here, the authors mention using a "100-hour subset of the publicly available LibriSpeech dataset." I will note this dataset and look for its citation in the references.

2. **3.2 Vision**: The authors state they used the "ILSVRC ImageNet competition dataset." I will also note this dataset and find its citation.

3. **3.3 Natural Language**: The authors refer to using the "BookCorpus dataset" for their natural language experiments. I will record this dataset and check for its citation.

4. **3.4 Reinforcement Learning**: The authors mention using "DeepMind Lab" for their reinforcement learning experiments. I will note this as well and look for its citation.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **LibriSpeech dataset**, the citation is:
  > Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. *Librispeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2015 IEEE International Conference on, pages 5206–5210, 2015.

- For **ImageNet dataset**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, Alexander C. Berg, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 115(3):211–252, 2015.

- For **BookCorpus dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yukun Zhu, Ryan Kiros, Rich Zemel, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Raquel Urtasun, Antonio Torralba, and Sanja Fidler. *Aligning books and movies: Towards story-like visual explanations by watching movies and reading books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 19–27, 2015.

- For **DeepMind Lab**, the citation is:
  > Charles Beattie, Joel Z Leibo, Denis Teplyashin, Tom Ward, Marcus Wainwright, Heinrich Küttler, Andrew Lefrancq, Simon Green, Víctor Valdés, Amir Sadik, et al. *DeepMind Lab*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1612.03801, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
