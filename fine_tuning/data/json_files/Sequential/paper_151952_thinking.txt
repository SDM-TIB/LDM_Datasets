To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ConvAMR: Abstract meaning representation parsing for legal document" by Lai Dac Viet et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved significant results on the **LDC2014T12 dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is important for their research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned. The introduction discusses the need for AMR parsing and references the **LDC2014T12 dataset** again, confirming its relevance.

In the **method section**, particularly in the **data annotation subsection**, the authors describe a self-annotated dataset called **JCivilCode-1.0**. They explain how this dataset was created by annotating the English version of the Japan Civil Code, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

Now, I will check the **experiments section** to confirm that both datasets are used in the experiments. The authors mention using **LDC2014T12** and **JCivilCode-1.0**, which validates my findings.

Next, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for both datasets:

1. For **LDC2014T12**, the citation is:
   > LDC2014T12. *English Gigaword Fifth Edition*. Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia, 2014.

2. For **JCivilCode-1.0**, since it is a self-annotated dataset, I will create a citation based on the paper itself:
   > Lai Dac Viet, Vu Trong Sinh, Nguyen Le Minh, Ken Satoh. *ConvAMR: Abstract meaning representation parsing for legal document*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Legal Knowledge and Information Systems, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that I have captured all necessary details about each dataset, including their names, descriptions, and citations.
