To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Federated Neural Architecture Search" by Yuxin Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed framework, DecNAS, is tested on large-scale datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **ImageNet**: The authors describe it as a commonly used dataset for image classification tasks. They note that it is split into 1,500 clients for their experiments.

2. **Celeba**: This dataset is used for face attribute classification and is split into 9,343 clients. The authors also mention that the dataset is non-iid, which is relevant for their federated learning context.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., and Fei-Fei, L. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (CVPR), pages 248–255, 2009.

- For **Celeba**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., and Tang, X. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 373–378, 2015.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
