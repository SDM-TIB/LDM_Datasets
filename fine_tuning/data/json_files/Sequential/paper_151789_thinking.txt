To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Speaker-independent raw waveform model for glottal excitation" by Lauri Juvela et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experiments section typically details the datasets employed for training and evaluation.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets or speech corpora that the authors may have used. The authors discuss the use of WaveNets and mention the need for large amounts of training data, which suggests that datasets are crucial to their research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors describe the speech material used for their experiments. They mention using a multi-speaker database originally released for speech enhancement research, specifically noting that they used a clean speech subset. They indicate that the full training dataset consists of 56 speakers, but they utilized a 28-speaker subset for their experiments. This section is likely to contain the most detailed information about the datasets.

The authors specify that the **seen speakers dataset** contains 11,571 utterances, amounting to 9.4 hours of speech. They also mention that they reserved the first ten utterances from each seen speaker for testing and randomly selected 500 utterances for validation. Additionally, they mention holding out two speakers (one female and one male) from the database test set as **unseen speakers**.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to a multi-speaker database for speech enhancement research, which is crucial for my dataset extraction. The citation for this dataset is:

- **Noisy Speech Database**: 
  > C. Valentini-Botinhao, “Noisy speech database for training speech enhancement algorithms and TTS models,” 2017. [Online]. Available: http://dx.doi.org/10.7488/ds/2117

This citation provides the necessary details about the dataset used in the research.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets utilized in the paper.
