To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spacecraft Collision Risk Assessment with Probabilistic Programming" by Giacomo Acciarini et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the generation of synthetic datasets of collisions, which indicates that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors mention the challenges posed by the increasing number of objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) and the need for data to assess collision risks. They highlight the importance of conjunction data messages (CDMs) and the lack of publicly available data, which suggests that they may reference specific datasets or sources of data.

In **section 3 (Probabilistic Model of Orbits, Conjunctions, and CDM Generation)**, the authors describe their model and mention that they calibrated it using real data from the ESA's Kelvins challenge. This is a specific dataset that I need to note.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors discuss their experiments with synthetic CDMs and the generation of datasets. They mention that they are working on generating a large dataset of synthetic CDMs calibrated with real data. However, they do not specify additional datasets in this section.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Kelvins Challenge Dataset**: The authors refer to anonymized real conjunction data released by ESA as the Kelvins challenge. The citation for this dataset is:
   > European Space Agency. *Kelvins Collision Avoidance Challenge Data*. Available at: https://kelvins.esa.int/collision-avoidance-challenge/data/ (September 2020).

2. **USSTRATCOM Catalog**: The authors mention that they constructed prior distributions based on real data from the public USSTRATCOM catalog. The citation for this dataset is:
   > United States Strategic Command. *USSTRATCOM Space Surveillance Network Catalog*. Available at: https://www.space-track.org (Accessed: Various dates).

3. **ESA DISCOS Database**: The authors also reference the ESA DISCOS database for orbital elements. The citation for this dataset is:
   > European Space Agency. *Discos Database*. Available at: https://discosweb.esoc.esa.int/ (Accessed: Various dates).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
