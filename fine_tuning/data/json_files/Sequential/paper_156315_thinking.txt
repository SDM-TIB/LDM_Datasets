To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combining Deep Learning and GARCH Models for Financial Volatility and Risk Forecasting" by Jakub Michańków et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors use daily logarithmic returns on the S&P 500 index, gold prices, and Bitcoin prices for their analysis. This suggests that these three datasets are central to the research.

Next, I will examine **section 3.1 (Data)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used in their study. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **S&P 500 Index**: The dataset consists of daily logarithmic rates of return from 6 April 2009 to 31 December 2020, totaling 2707 observations.
2. **Bitcoin (BTC/USD)**: This dataset includes daily logarithmic rates of return from 5 August 2013 to 31 December 2020, also with 2707 observations.
3. **Gold (XAU/USD)**: The dataset comprises daily logarithmic rates of return from 8 July 2010 to 31 December 2020, again with 2707 observations.

The paper provides sufficient detail about the time frames and the nature of the data, confirming that these are the datasets utilized for the experiments.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are commonly used financial indices and do not have specific papers associated with them, I will note that they are standard datasets in financial analysis. Therefore, I will provide a general citation format for each dataset:

- For **S&P 500 Index**:
  > Standard & Poor's. *S&P 500 Index*. Available at: [https://www.spglobal.com/](https://www.spglobal.com/)

- For **Bitcoin (BTC/USD)**:
  > CoinMarketCap. *Bitcoin (BTC) Historical Data*. Available at: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/historical-data/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/historical-data/)

- For **Gold (XAU/USD)**:
  > London Bullion Market Association. *Gold Price History*. Available at: [https://www.lbma.org.uk/](https://www.lbma.org.uk/)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
