To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeStress: Deep Learning for Unsupervised Identification of Mental Stress in Firefighters from Heart-rate Variability (HRV) Data" by Ali Oskooei et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves collecting RR interval time series data from nearly 100 firefighter trainees, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **data acquisition section** (section 3), where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They mention that the RR intervals were collected from 100 firefighters and smoke divers during a training exercise. This section will likely contain crucial details about the dataset, including how it was collected and its characteristics.

In this section, the authors describe the context of the data collection, including the specific training exercise and the equipment used (heart rate measuring chest belts and smartphones). They also mention that the data was processed into non-overlapping windows of size 30, which is important for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset in the references section. However, since the dataset is based on original data collected by the authors and does not reference an external dataset, I will note that the dataset is unique to this study and does not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Data from Firefighter Trainees
- **Description**: RR interval time series data collected from nearly 100 firefighter trainees during a training exercise designed to induce mental stress. The data was collected using Polar H10 chest belts and smartphones, and it was processed into non-overlapping windows of size 30.
- **Citation**: This dataset is unique to this study and does not have a formal citation.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset details, ensuring that I emphasize the unique nature of the dataset and its context within the study.
