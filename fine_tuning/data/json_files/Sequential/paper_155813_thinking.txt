To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (convLSTM) for Spatio-Temporal Forecastings of Saturations and Pressure in the SACROC Field" by Palash Panja et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves predicting spatio-temporal parameters in the SACROC oil field, which suggests that there are datasets related to oil, gas, and water saturations, as well as pressure data.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the **"Reservoir Model"** and **"Sample Preparation"** sections. Here, the authors describe the data extraction process and the specific properties being analyzed. They mention that the data for oil, gas, and water saturations, as well as pressure, are recorded monthly for 30 years, resulting in a total of 360 frames for each property.

In the **"Workflow"** section, the authors detail how the data is extracted from the reservoir simulator and prepared for machine learning. They specify that the data is normalized and divided into training and testing sets, which further confirms the structured nature of the datasets.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** of the datasets mentioned. The paper indicates that the data is derived from a reservoir model representing the SACROC oilfield, which is accessible through the National Energy Technology Laboratoryâ€™s Energy Data Exchange (EDX). Therefore, I will cite this repository as the source of the dataset.

The relevant datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **SACROC Oil Field Dataset**: This dataset includes spatio-temporal data for oil, gas, and water saturations, as well as pressure, recorded monthly over a 30-year period. The dataset is derived from a reservoir model that simulates the SACROC oilfield.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
