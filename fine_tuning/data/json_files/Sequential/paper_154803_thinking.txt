To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SGE NET: Video Object Detection with Squeezed GRU and Information Entropy Map" by Rui Su et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a method for video object detection, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the evaluation of this method.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of video object detection and the need for efficient methods. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets at this point, so I will continue to the methodology and experiments sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention that they conducted experiments on the **ImageNet VID 2015** dataset, which is crucial for my extraction. The authors specify that this dataset contains 3,862 snippets for training and 555 snippets for testing, covering 30 categories. This is a clear indication that this dataset is central to their evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet VID 2015 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Jia Deng, Wenjun Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the ImageNet VID 2015 dataset.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
