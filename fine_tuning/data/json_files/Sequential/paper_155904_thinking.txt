To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Open-Domain Dialogue Evaluation with a Causal Inference Model" by Cat P. Le et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions evaluating dialogue systems using conversational data from the **Alexa Prize SocialBot**, which suggests that this dataset is significant for the study.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly where the authors describe their experimental setup. In this section, they mention using a dataset of **128K de-identified conversational dialogues** collected from interactions with the Alexa SocialBot. This indicates that the dataset is substantial and relevant to their evaluation methods.

I will also look for any specific details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. Here, the authors provide more context about the dataset, including its size and the nature of the dialogues, which consist of user interactions with the Alexa SocialBot. They mention that the dialogues are de-identified and cover various topics, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Alexa Prize SocialBot dataset. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, but it references the Alexa Prize proceedings, which typically include information about the dataset.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile the dataset details as follows:

1. **Alexa Prize SocialBot Dataset**: This dataset consists of 128,000 de-identified conversational dialogues collected from users interacting with the Alexa SocialBot. It is used for evaluating dialogue systems and includes various user interactions.

The citation for the Alexa Prize SocialBot dataset can be referenced as:
> Ram, A., Prasad, R., Khatri, A., Venkatesh, A., Gabriel, R., Liu, Q., Nunn, J., Hedayatnia, B., Cheng, M., Nagar, A., et al. *Conversational AI: the science behind the Alexa Prize*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.03604, 2018.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review, ensuring that the citation is included for proper attribution.
