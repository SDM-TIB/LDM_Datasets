To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Flip Successive Cancellation Decoding of Polar Codes with LSTM Networks" by Xianbin Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses a deep learning approach to improve successive cancellation decoding, but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section V (Network Training and Performance Evaluation)**, where the authors describe the training process for their LSTM network. They mention generating a database for training, which likely contains simulated data for training the model. I will look for specific details about this database, including how it was created and what it contains.

In this section, the authors state that they generate a database by conducting extensive simulations where random information bits are encoded using polar codes. This indicates that the dataset is derived from simulation rather than a publicly available dataset. The database includes pairs of log likelihood ratios (LLRs) and corresponding one-hot representations of the first-error bit.

Since the dataset is not a standard one and is generated specifically for this research, I will note that it is a custom dataset created for the purpose of training the LSTM network.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if any external datasets or related works are cited that might provide context or additional datasets. However, the references primarily focus on previous works related to polar codes and decoding algorithms, rather than datasets.

Based on my findings, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Custom Database for LSTM Training**: This dataset is generated through simulations of polar codes, containing log likelihood ratios and labels for the first-error bit. It is not publicly available and is specific to the experiments conducted in this paper.

Since this dataset is not a standard one, I will not provide a citation in the traditional sense, but I will note that it is derived from the authors' simulations.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I highlight the custom nature of the dataset and its relevance to the research conducted in the paper.
