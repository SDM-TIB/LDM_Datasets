To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Model Generalization by Agreement of Learned Representations from Data Augmentation" by Rowel Atienza, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights improvements in classification accuracy on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets are used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **experimental results section**. The author discusses the performance of various models on different datasets, including:

1. **ImageNet**: The paper mentions that the AgMax method improves classification accuracy on the ImageNet dataset, which is a well-known dataset for image classification tasks.

2. **CIFAR10 and CIFAR100**: These datasets are mentioned as commonly used benchmarks for evaluating data augmentation techniques. The paper states that both datasets contain 60,000 images, with CIFAR10 having 10 classes and CIFAR100 having 100 classes.

3. **Speech Commands Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as containing 64,727 utterances from 1,881 speakers, used for evaluating the performance of the LeNet5 and VGG11 models.

4. **PascalVOC**: The paper discusses object detection and segmentation tasks using the PascalVOC dataset, which is a standard benchmark in the field.

5. **COCO (Common Objects in Context)**: The paper mentions using COCO for both box and mask evaluations in object detection and segmentation tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:

- For **CIFAR10 and CIFAR100**, the citation is:

- For **COCO**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations to ensure that they are ready for any further processing or review.
