To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explicitly incorporating spatial information to recurrent networks for agriculture" by Claus Smitt et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of RGB-D images and robot odometry, which suggests that datasets related to these modalities are likely discussed. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of accurate classification and monitoring in agricultural robotics, hinting at the presence of specific datasets used for these tasks.

Next, I will focus on the **datasets section (Section IV)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Arable Farming Sugar Beet (SB20)**: This dataset was captured at a sugar beet field using an Intel RealSense D435i camera. It includes robot wheel odometry and RGB-D images of crops and various weed categories. The authors specify that it is used for multi-class segmentation tasks.

2. **Horticulture Glasshouse Sweet Pepper (BUP20)**: This dataset consists of video sequences from a glasshouse environment, capturing two sweet pepper cultivars. It also includes RGB-D images and odometry data, and is used for binary-class segmentation tasks.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were utilized for their validation experiments, reinforcing their relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

- For the **SB20 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ahmadi, A., Halstead, M., & McCool, C. (2021). Virtual temporal samples for recurrent neural networks: Applied to semantic segmentation in agriculture. In DAGM German Conference on Pattern Recognition (GCPR), 574–588.

- For the **BUP20 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Smitt, C., Halstead, M., Zaenker, T., Bennewitz, M., & McCool, C. (2021). Pathobot: A robot for glasshouse crop phenotyping and intervention. In 2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2324–2330.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
