To extract datasets from the research paper titled "phi-LSTM: A Phrase-based Hierarchical LSTM Model for Image Captioning" by Ying Hua Tan and Chee Seng Chan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention that their model has shown competitive results on **Flickr8k** and **Flickr30k** datasets, indicating that these datasets are likely to be important for their research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 6 (Experiment)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. They explicitly state that the phi-LSTM model is tested on two benchmark datasets:

1. **Flickr8k Dataset**: This dataset consists of 8,000 images, each annotated with five ground truth descriptions sourced from crowd-sourcing. The authors mention that 1,000 images are selected for validation and another 1,000 for testing, while the remaining images are used for training.

2. **Flickr30k Dataset**: This dataset contains 30,000 images, also annotated with five ground truth descriptions per image. Similar to the Flickr8k dataset, 1,000 images are used for validation and another 1,000 for testing, with the rest allocated for training.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Flickr8k Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Rashtchian, C., Young, P., Hodosh, M., & Hockenmaier, J. (2010). Collecting image annotations using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. In Proceedings of the NAACL HLT 2010 Workshop on Creating Speech and Language Data with Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (pp. 139–147).

- For **Flickr30k Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Young, P., Lai, A., Hodosh, M., & Hockenmaier, J. (2014). From image descriptions to visual denotations: New similarity metrics for semantic inference over event descriptions. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2, 67–78.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
