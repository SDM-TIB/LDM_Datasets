To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WaveCRN: An Efficient Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network for End-to-end Speech Enhancement" by Tsun-An Hsieh et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but I will need to look deeper into the methodology and experiments for specific dataset details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of speech enhancement and mention various approaches but do not specify datasets yet. I will move on to the **methodology** section, where they describe their proposed model and its components.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors detail the tasks they performed and the datasets used. They mention using an **open-source dataset** for the speech denoising task, which combines the Voice Bank corpus and the DEMAND corpus. This is a crucial finding, as it indicates a dataset used in their experiments.

For the **compressed speech restoration task**, they specify that they used the **TIMIT corpus**. This is another important dataset that I need to document.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Voice Bank corpus**, the citation is:
   > C. Veaux, J. Yamagishi, and S. King. "The voice bank corpus: Design, collection and data analysis of a large regional accent speech database." In Proceedings of O-COCOSDA/CASLRE, 2013.

2. For the **DEMAND corpus**, the citation is:
   > J. Thiemann, N. Ito, and E. Vincent. "Demand: a collection of multi-channel recordings of acoustic noise in diverse environments." In Proceedings of Meetings Acoustics, 2013.

3. For the **TIMIT corpus**, the citation is:
   > J. S. Garofolo, L. F. Lamel, W. M. Fisher, J. G. Fiscus, D. S. Pallett, and N. L. Dahlgren. "DARPA TIMIT acoustic-phonetic continuous speech corpus cd-rom. NIST speech disc 1-1.1." NASA STI/Recon Technical Report, vol. 93, 1993.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets used in the paper:

1. **Voice Bank corpus**: Used for the speech denoising task, which combines clean speech with various noise types.
2. **DEMAND corpus**: Also used in conjunction with the Voice Bank corpus for the speech denoising task.
3. **TIMIT corpus**: Used for the compressed speech restoration task.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
