To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ScanERU: Interactive 3D Visual Grounding based on Embodied Reference Understanding" by Ziyang Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract introduces a new dataset called **ScanERU**, which is specifically constructed for the task of Embodied Reference Understanding (ERU). This is a strong indication that I need to focus on this dataset.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **dataset** sections in detail. In the **dataset section**, the authors provide a comprehensive description of the **ScanERU dataset**, stating that it is a semi-synthetic dataset designed for the ERU task. They mention that it includes 706 unique indoor scenes, 9,929 referred objects, and 46,173 descriptions. This section is crucial as it provides specific details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

Additionally, the authors reference two existing datasets that were used to construct the **ScanERU dataset**: **ScanRefer** and **ScanNet**. I will need to extract information about these datasets as well.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **ScanERU Dataset**: The citation for the dataset is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is a new dataset introduced in this paper. Therefore, I will cite it as:
   > Ziyang Lu, Yunqiang Pei, Guoqing Wang, Yang Yang, Zheng Wang, Heng Tao Shen. *ScanERU: Interactive 3D Visual Grounding based on Embodied Reference Understanding*. arXiv:2303.13186, 2023.

2. **ScanRefer Dataset**: The citation for the ScanRefer dataset is:
   > Dave Zhenyu Chen, Angel X. Chang, Matthias Nießner. *ScanRefer: 3D Object Localization in RGB-D Scans using Natural Language*. In Computer Vision – ECCV 2020: 16th European Conference, Glasgow, UK, August 23–28, 2020, Proceedings, Part XX, pages 202–221. Springer, 2020.

3. **ScanNet Dataset**: The citation for the ScanNet dataset is:
   > Angela Dai, Angel X. Chang, Manolis Savva, Maciej Halber, Thomas Funkhouser, Matthias Nießner. *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D Reconstructions of Indoor Scenes*. Cornell University, arXiv:1702.04402, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, which is essential for any further analysis or research based on this work.
