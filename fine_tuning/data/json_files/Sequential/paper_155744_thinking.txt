To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Investigating Content-Aware Neural Text-to-Speech MOS Prediction Using Prosodic and Linguistic Features" by Alexandra Vioni et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize the **SOMOS dataset**, which is a neural TTS-only dataset with crowdsourced naturalness MOS evaluations. This is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will examine the **Data section** (section 2) in detail, where the authors provide a comprehensive description of the **SOMOS dataset**. They mention that it consists of 20,000 TTS audio files generated with the LJ Speech voice, and each audio file has been assigned 17-23 naturalness ratings by crowdsourced listeners. This section confirms the dataset's details and its relevance to the study.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SOMOS dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- **SOMOS Dataset**: 
  > Georgia Maniati, Alexandra Vioni, Nikolaos Ellinas, Karolos Nikitaras, Konstantinos Klapsas, June Sig Sung, Gunu Jho, Aimilios Chalamandaris, and Pirros Tsiakoulis. *SOMOS: The Samsung Open MOS Dataset for the Evaluation of Neural Text-to-Speech Synthesis*. In Proceedings of the Interspeech, 2022.

Additionally, the paper mentions the **LJ Speech Dataset**, which is also relevant. I will look for its citation in the references:

- **LJ Speech Dataset**:
  > Keith Ito and Linda Johnson. *The LJ Speech Dataset*. Available at: https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. The datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **SOMOS Dataset**: A dataset consisting of 20,000 TTS audio files with naturalness ratings.
2. **LJ Speech Dataset**: A dataset used for generating TTS audio files.

I will ensure that the full citations are included for both datasets, as they are crucial for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent work.
