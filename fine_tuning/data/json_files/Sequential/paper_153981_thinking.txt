To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporal Fusion Network for Temporal Action Localization: Submission to ActivityNet Challenge 2020 (Task E)" by Zhiwu Qing et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the method and mentions the **HACS dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is relevant to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section** to see if the authors elaborate on the datasets used. In this section, they mention that they fine-tuned their model on the **HACS dataset**. This confirms that the HACS dataset is indeed utilized in their experiments.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors describe their approach and mention using the **Kinetics-600 dataset** for pre-training their model. This indicates that both the HACS dataset and Kinetics-600 dataset are important for their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **HACS dataset**, the citation is:
   > Hao Zhao, Antonio Torralba, Lorenzo Torresani, and Zhaowen Yan. *HACS: Human Action Clips and Segments Dataset for Recognition and Temporal Localization*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 8668–8678, 2019.

2. For the **Kinetics-600 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Joao Carreira and Andrew Zisserman. *Quo Vadis, Action Recognition? A New Model and the Kinetics Dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 6299–6308, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
