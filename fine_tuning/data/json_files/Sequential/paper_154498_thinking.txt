To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamical prediction of two meteorological factors using the deep neural network and the long short-term memory (â… )" by Ki-Hong Shin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses data from "ten metropolitan cities of South Korea from March 2014 to February 2020," which suggests that there is a specific dataset being utilized.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Theoretical background)**, particularly the subsection **2-1 (Data)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the daily (low frequency) time-series data set of average temperature and humidity is taken from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) database. They specify that the data covers ten metropolitan cities: Seoul, Incheon, Daejeon, Daegu, Busan, Pohang, Tongyeong, Gwangju, Mokpo, and Jeonju, spanning from March 2014 to February 2020.

The authors also clarify that approximately 85% of the data is used for training the neural network models, while the remaining 15% is used for testing the predictive accuracy. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is sourced from the Korea Meteorological Administration, I will note that the citation for this dataset is not a traditional academic reference but rather a governmental database. Therefore, I will format it appropriately.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA). *Daily time-series data of average temperature and humidity for ten metropolitan cities in South Korea (March 2014 - February 2020)*. Available at: [KMA website link].

With this information, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Daily time-series data of average temperature and humidity
2. **Description**: This dataset includes daily low-frequency time-series data of average temperature and humidity for ten metropolitan cities in South Korea, covering the period from March 2014 to February 2020.
3. **Source**: Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA)
4. **Full Citation**: Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA). *Daily time-series data of average temperature and humidity for ten metropolitan cities in South Korea (March 2014 - February 2020)*. Available at: [KMA website link].

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
