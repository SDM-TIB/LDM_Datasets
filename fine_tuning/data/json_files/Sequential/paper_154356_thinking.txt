To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Knowledge Distillation Ensemble Framework for Predicting Short and Long-term Hospitalisation Outcomes from Electronic Health Records Data" by Zina M Ibrahim et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the context and motivation for their research. Here, they mention the use of electronic health records (EHRs) and the need for accurate predictions of hospital outcomes, which suggests that datasets derived from EHRs are likely involved.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for specific details about the datasets used in their experiments. The authors describe their approach and may provide information about the datasets, including their sources, sizes, and characteristics. 

In the **experimental evaluation section**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their case studies. They describe three datasets:

1. **COVID-19 Dataset**: This dataset includes data from 1,276 adult inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 at two hospitals in South East London. It contains both static and dynamic features, such as demographics and vital signs.

2. **Pneumonia Dataset**: This dataset is extracted from the MIMIC-III database and includes data from 2,798 ICU stays of patients diagnosed with pneumonia. It contains time-stamped vital signs and laboratory test results.

3. **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Dataset**: Also sourced from the MIMIC-III database, this dataset includes data from 2,822 ICU stays of patients with CKD, similar to the pneumonia dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The MIMIC-III database is a well-known resource, and its citation is:

- For the **MIMIC-III database**:
  > Johnson, A. E. W., Pollard, T. J., Shen, L., et al. (2016). MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database. *Scientific Data*, 3(1), 160035.

For the **COVID-19 dataset**, since it is locally collected, I will note that it does not have a formal citation but will mention the hospitals involved:

- For the **COVID-19 dataset**:
  > Data collected from Kingâ€™s College Hospital and Princess Royal University Hospital, South East London, UK.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citations for the datasets as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
