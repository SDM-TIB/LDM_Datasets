To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Sentiment Classification and Topic Discovery on Novel Coronavirus or COVID-19 Online Discussions: NLP Using LSTM Recurrent Neural Network Approach" by Hamed Jelodar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used automated extraction of COVID-19-related discussions from social media, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of online forums like Reddit for collecting user opinions on health issues, specifically mentioning that they analyze COVID-19-related comments. This hints at the existence of a dataset but does not provide specific details yet.

Next, I will look into the **methodology section** where they describe the data collection process. Here, they mention that they assessed **563,079 COVID-19-related comments from Reddit**, collected between January 20, 2020, and March 19, 2020. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

The paper also provides a link to the dataset on Kaggle, which is crucial for citation purposes. The authors state that the full dataset is available at the Kaggle website, specifically at the URL: https://www.kaggle.com/khalidalharthi/coronavirus-posts-in-reddit-platform.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the dataset:

1. **COVID-19 Comments Dataset**: This dataset consists of 563,079 comments related to COVID-19 collected from various subreddits. The comments were gathered during the specified time frame, and the dataset is used for sentiment analysis and topic modeling.

Next, I will retrieve the full citation for this dataset. The citation for the dataset is:
> Khalid Alharthi. *Coronavirus Posts in Reddit Platform*. Kaggle, 2020. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/khalidalharthi/coronavirus-posts-in-reddit-platform.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to format the dataset information according to the required structure, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is critical for proper referencing.
