To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Unifying Framework of Bilinear LSTMs" by Mohit Rajpal and Bryan Kian Hsiang Low, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the performance of their bilinear LSTM framework on various language-based sequence learning tasks. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets here, so I will need to look further.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In **Section 4.1 (Synthetic Data Benchmark)**, they mention constructing a synthetic dataset based on a multivariate normal distribution. This dataset is specifically designed for their experiments, so I will note it down.

In **Section 4.2 (Language Modeling)**, the authors state that they validate their model on the **Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset**. This is a well-known dataset for language modeling tasks, and I will include it in my extraction.

In **Section 4.3 (Logical Inference)**, they mention using a dataset for the logical inference task proposed by Bowman et al. (2015). I will need to reference this dataset as well.

Finally, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: The authors created a synthetic dataset based on a multivariate normal distribution, but since it is not a standard dataset, I will describe it as such without a formal citation.

2. **Penn Treebank (PTB) Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Marcus, M. P., Santorini, B., & Marcinkiewicz, M. A. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313-330.

3. **Logical Inference Dataset**: The citation for the dataset used in the logical inference task is:
   > Bowman, S. R., Angeli, G., Potts, C., & Manning, C. D. (2015). A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference. In *Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing* (pp. 632-642).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
