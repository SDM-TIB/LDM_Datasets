To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Stochastic Natural Gradient Method for One-Shot Neural Architecture Search" by Youhei Akimoto et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of neural architecture search (NAS) and its applications, but I need to look for specific datasets. I will pay close attention to any references to datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly sections 3.2 and 3.3, where the authors describe their experiments in detail. Here, they explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, categorized into 10 classes. The authors mention that they adopt standard preprocessing and data augmentation techniques for this dataset.

2. **CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)**: This dataset contains 202,599 RGB images of human faces. The authors specify that they use 101,000 images for training and 2,000 for testing, with specific preprocessing steps mentioned.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: Canadian Institute for Advanced Research*. 2009.

- For the **CelebA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3730–3738, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I will document the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: 
   - Description: A dataset consisting of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images across 10 classes.
   - Citation: Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: Canadian Institute for Advanced Research*. 2009.

2. **CelebA Dataset**: 
   - Description: A dataset containing 202,599 RGB images of human faces, with 101,000 images for training and 2,000 for testing.
   - Citation: Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3730–3738, 2015.

With this information, I am ready to create structured entries for each dataset as needed.
