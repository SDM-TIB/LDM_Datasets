To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adan: Adaptive Nesterov Momentum Algorithm for Faster Optimizing Deep Models" by Xingyu Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. In this case, the abstract discusses the performance of the Adan optimizer across various tasks, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

2. **Identify Sections Related to Experiments**: Next, I will look for sections that detail the experiments conducted in the study. This is typically where datasets are explicitly mentioned. I will focus on sections labeled "Experiments," "Methodology," or similar headings.

3. **Locate Dataset Descriptions**: In the relevant sections, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets. This includes checking for names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any specific characteristics that are highlighted by the authors. For example, if the authors mention using datasets like ImageNet, Penn Treebank, or others, I will note these down.

4. **Check for Dataset Citations**: After identifying the datasets, I will look for citations or references to the original papers or sources where these datasets can be found. This information is usually located in the references section of the paper. I will ensure to extract the full citation for each dataset mentioned.

5. **Compile the Information**: Once I have gathered the names of the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format. Each dataset entry will include:
   - The name of the dataset
   - A brief description of the dataset
   - The full citation for the dataset

6. **Review for Completeness**: Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure that all datasets mentioned in the paper are accounted for and that the citations are accurate and complete.

By following these steps, I will be able to systematically extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, ensuring that I provide full citations as required.
