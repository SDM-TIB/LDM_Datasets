To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis with Gated Convolutional Networks" by Wei Xue and Tao Li, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experiments were conducted on **SemEval datasets**, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention using datasets from the **SemEval workshops**, specifically for customer reviews about restaurants and laptops. This is a clear indication that I need to extract details about these datasets.

In this section, the authors provide information about two main tasks: **Aspect-Category Sentiment Analysis (ACSA)** and **Aspect-Term Sentiment Analysis (ATSA)**. They mention creating a larger dataset called **"Restaurant-Large"** by merging restaurant reviews from three years of SemEval workshops. They also mention a **"Restaurant-Large-Hard"** dataset, which consists of sentences with multiple aspect labels associated with different sentiments.

I will also note that they refer to the **SemEval 2014 Task 4** datasets, which include reviews for both restaurants and laptops. This indicates that there are multiple datasets involved.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **SemEval datasets**, the citation is:
   > Maria Pontiki, Dimitrios Galanis, John Pavlopoulos, Haris Papageorgiou, Ion Androutsopoulos, and Suresh Manandhar. *SemEval-2014 Task 4: Aspect based sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2014), pages 27–35, 2014.

2. For the **NRC-Canada dataset**, which is referenced in the context of comparison, the citation is:
   > Svetlana Kiritchenko, Xiaodan Zhu, Colin Cherry, and Saif M. Mohammad. *NRC-Canada-2014: Detecting aspects and sentiment in customer reviews*. In SemEval@COLING, pages 437–442, Stroudsburg, PA, USA, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have a clear record of the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
