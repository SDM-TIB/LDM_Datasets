To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Statistical Recurrent Unit" by Junier B. Oliva, Barnabás Póczos, and Jeff Schneider, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experiments section typically details the datasets employed in the study.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that the authors might have used to validate their findings. If the authors mention specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down for further investigation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that describe the experiments conducted. Here, the authors usually specify the datasets used, including details such as the number of samples, types of data, and any relevant characteristics. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as they often contain concise information.

As I identify datasets, I will also check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

From my reading, I have identified the following datasets used in the experiments:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for image classification tasks, consisting of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits. The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

2. **Polyphonic Music Dataset**: The authors used the polyphonic music datasets from Boulanger-Lewandowski et al. (2012) for their experiments. The citation is:
   > Nicolas Boulanger-Lewandowski, Yoshua Bengio, and Pascal Vincent. *Modeling Temporal Dependencies in High-Dimensional Sequences: Application to Polyphonic Music Generation and Transcription*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1206.6392, 2012.

3. **North America Regional Reanalysis (NARR) Project**: This dataset provides long-term climate data for North America. The citation is:
   > North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) Project. *NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information*. Available at: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/narr.

4. **SportVU NBA Tracking Data**: This dataset contains optical tracking data for NBA players. The citation is:
   > NBA Movement Data. Available at: https://github.com/sealneaward/nba-movement-data. Accessed: 2016-10-17.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or reference.
