To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KnowGraph@IITK at SemEval-2021 Task 11: Building Knowledge Graph for NLP Research" by Shashank Shailabh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a system for a contributions-focused knowledge graph but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide details about the data used for their experiments. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of **287 annotated NLP research documents** in English, which is crucial information. I will note this dataset and its characteristics.

In **sub-section 4.1 (Data)**, the authors provide more details about the dataset, including the distribution of documents across training, development, and test sets. They specify that the training set contains **237 documents**, the development set has **50 documents**, and the test set includes **155 documents**. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's structure.

The authors also mention that the dataset annotation scheme follows the work of D’Souza and Auer (2020), which indicates that the dataset is based on a specific methodology for annotating contributions in NLP literature. I will need to include this reference when documenting the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset annotation scheme. The relevant citation is:
> Jennifer D’Souza and S. Auer. *Nlpcontributions: An annotation scheme for machine reading of scholarly contributions in natural language processing literature*. ArXiv, abs/2006.12870.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **NLP Research Contributions Dataset**: This dataset consists of 287 annotated NLP research documents in English, with a distribution of 237 documents for training, 50 for development, and 155 for testing. The dataset follows the annotation scheme proposed by D’Souza and Auer (2020).

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further use or processing.
