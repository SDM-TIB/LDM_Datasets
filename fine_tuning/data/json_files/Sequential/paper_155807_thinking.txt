To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Embedding generation for text classification of Brazilian Portuguese user reviews: from bag-of-words to transformers" by Frederico Dias Souza and João Baptista de Oliveira e Souza Filho, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study includes five open-source databases, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (The text classification pipeline)**, where the authors describe the databases used for their experiments. Here, they mention that five open-source databases were utilized, specifically:

1. **Olist Dataset**: Contains product reviews from an e-commerce platform, with 30,000 training instances, 4,000 validation instances, and 4,000 test instances.

2. **Buscapé Dataset**: Another e-commerce dataset with 59,000 training instances, 7,000 validation instances, and 7,000 test instances.

3. **B2W Dataset**: This dataset includes 93,000 training instances, 12,000 validation instances, and 12,000 test instances, also from an e-commerce context.

4. **UTLC-Apps Dataset**: Comprising 775,000 training instances, 97,000 validation instances, and 97,000 test instances, this dataset contains reviews from Google Play Store applications.

5. **UTLC-Movies Dataset**: This dataset has reviews of movies available on the Filmow platform, with 7,000 training instances, 6,000 validation instances, and 6,000 test instances.

In the **data availability section**, the authors provide a link to the repository where these datasets can be accessed, which is crucial for citation purposes.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the references section or any relevant citations within the text. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely hosted on a public repository.

The citation for the datasets can be structured as follows:

- **Olist Dataset**: 
  > Olist. *Olist Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fredericods/ptbr-sentiment-analysis-datasets.

- **Buscapé Dataset**: 
  > Buscapé. *Buscapé Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fredericods/ptbr-sentiment-analysis-datasets.

- **B2W Dataset**: 
  > B2W. *B2W Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fredericods/ptbr-sentiment-analysis-datasets.

- **UTLC-Apps Dataset**: 
  > UTLC-Apps. *UTLC-Apps Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fredericods/ptbr-sentiment-analysis-datasets.

- **UTLC-Movies Dataset**: 
  > UTLC-Movies. *UTLC-Movies Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fredericods/ptbr-sentiment-analysis-datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation.
