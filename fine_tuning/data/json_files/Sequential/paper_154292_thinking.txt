To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prediction-based GNSS spoofing attack detection for autonomous vehicles" by Sagar Dasgupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset description sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a publicly available dataset, which suggests that there is a specific dataset to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **dataset description section**. Here, the authors explicitly mention the **Comma2k19 dataset**. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its purpose, the type of data it contains, and how it was collected. The paper states that the dataset includes various AV sensor data collected during a 33-hour drive on California's US-280 highway, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's context.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Comma2k19 dataset. The paper cites the dataset as follows:

- **Comma2k19 Dataset**: 
  > Schafer, H., Santana, E., Haden, A., & Biasini, R. (2018). *A Commute in Data: The Comma2k19 Dataset*. 

This citation is essential for proper attribution and should be included in the dataset entry.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation. The dataset entry will highlight the dataset's purpose, the type of data collected, and any relevant statistics or characteristics mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use in future references or analyses.
