To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improved AutoEncoder with LSTM module and KL divergence for anomaly detection" by Wei Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the efficacy of the proposed model is validated through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets they conducted experiments on:

1. **CIFAR10**: The CIFAR10 dataset consists of 60,000 32 × 32 RGB color images categorized into 10 different classes. The training and testing set consists of 50,000 and 10,000 samples respectively.

2. **Fashion MNIST**: The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images with 28 × 28 pixels forming 10 classes. This dataset is divided into two parts with 60,000 images in the training set and 10,000 images in the testing set.

3. **MVTec AD**: This dataset contains a collection of images spanning various materials and products commonly found in industrial manufacturing settings, with more than 5,000 high-resolution images categorized into fifteen distinct classes.

4. **Wind Turbine Blade Icing (WTBI)**: The WTBI dataset consists of SCADA information from multiple turbines within a wind farm, collected over a duration of two months. The data is divided into non-icing and icing periods, with the non-icing period identified as normal and the icing period as abnormal.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/learning-features-2009-TR.pdf

- For **Fashion MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

- For **MVTec AD**, the citation is:
  > Philipp Bergmann, Martin Fauser, Daniel Sattlegger, and Christoph Steger. *MVTec AD–A Comprehensive Real-World Dataset for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 9592–9600, 2019.

- For **WTBI**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is typically referenced in the context of SCADA systems and anomaly detection in wind turbines.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or citations.
