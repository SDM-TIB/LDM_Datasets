To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Indian Sign Language Recognition Using MediaPipe Holistic" by Kaushal Goyal and Dr. Velmathi G, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a general overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction may give context about the need for datasets in sign language recognition.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, the authors describe how they manually extracted frames from sign language videos to create two distinct datasets: one for static sign language and another for gesture sign language. They mention capturing 60 videos for each sign, with each video consisting of 30 frames, and each frame containing 1662 key points.

I will also look for any references to existing datasets in the **related work section**. The authors may cite other datasets that have been used in previous research, which could be relevant to their work.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to retrieve full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

From the methodology, I can summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Static Sign Language Dataset**: This dataset consists of 26 static signs corresponding to the alphabet. The authors captured videos of these signs, focusing on fixed hand shapes.

2. **Gesture Sign Language Dataset**: This dataset includes videos of complete sentences in Indian Sign Language, capturing the dynamic aspects of sign language, including full body movements and facial expressions.

Next, I will check the references for any specific citations related to these datasets. If the authors have created these datasets themselves, I will note that they are original datasets developed for this research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include full citations for any referenced datasets or related works. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for structured output or further processing.
