To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Addressing Prediction Delays in Time Series Forecasting: A Continuous GRU Approach with Derivative Regularization" by Sheo Yon Jhin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on various datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention that they evaluate their method on **six benchmark datasets**, specifically:

1. **AAPL Dataset**: This dataset contains stock prices for Apple Inc. and is publicly available at Yahoo Finance.
2. **AMZN Dataset**: This dataset contains stock prices for Amazon.com Inc. and is also available at Yahoo Finance.
3. **GOOG Dataset**: This dataset contains stock prices for Alphabet Inc. (Google) and can be accessed via Yahoo Finance.
4. **MSFT Dataset**: This dataset contains stock prices for Microsoft Corporation, available at Yahoo Finance.
5. **Exchange Dataset**: This dataset includes exchange data among eight countries and is available on Google Drive.
6. **Weather Dataset**: This dataset measures various weather indicators and is also available on Google Drive.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **AAPL Dataset**:
  > Apple Inc. 2024. Apple Stock. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/history?p=AAPL.

- For **AMZN Dataset**:
  > Amazon.com Inc. 2024. Amazon Stock. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN/history?p=AMZN.

- For **GOOG Dataset**:
  > Alphabet Inc. 2024. Google Stock. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/history?p=GOOG.

- For **MSFT Dataset**:
  > Microsoft Corporation. 2024. MSFT Stock. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT/history?p=MSFT.

- For **Exchange Dataset**:
  > Exchange Data. 2024. Available at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZOYpTUa82_jCcxIdTmyr0LXQfvaM9vIy.

- For **Weather Dataset**:
  > Weather Data. 2024. Available at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZOYpTUa82_jCcxIdTmyr0LXQfvaM9vIy.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
