To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LSTM-based Space Occupancy Prediction towards Efficient Building Energy Management" by Juye Kim, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used real-world energy data collected from multiple rooms of a university building, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments Setup)**, where the author explicitly discusses the dataset. Here, the author states that they obtained HVAC usage data from a university campus’s energy data repository, specifically mentioning that the data includes various parameters such as air flow, cooling and heating setpoints, and occupancy status. This section provides a clear description of the dataset used for the experiments.

In **section 3.1 (Dataset)**, the author provides further details about the dataset, including the time span of the data collection (from 7/9/2019 to 2/1/2020) and the specific rooms involved (five rooms in the B-level of an academic building). This section confirms the dataset's relevance and context.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from a university's energy data repository and not a standalone published dataset, I will note that the citation may not be available in a traditional format. Instead, I will document the source as follows:

- **HVAC Usage Data**: This dataset was obtained from the university campus’s energy data repository, which includes HVAC data on five rooms in the B-level of an academic building, collected every minute from 7/9/2019 to 2/1/2020.

Since there are no additional datasets mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the necessary details and citations.

In summary, I have identified the dataset used in the research, described its contents and context, and noted the source of the data. This will allow for proper documentation and referencing in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
