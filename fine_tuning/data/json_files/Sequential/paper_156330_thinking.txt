To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Three Types of Freezing of Gait Events Using Deep Learning Models" by Wen Tao Mo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize various deep learning models to predict freezing of gait events, which suggests that they likely used specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly the **Data Input** subsection, where the authors describe the datasets used for model training. Here, they mention three types of data files: **Defog data files**, **Tdcsfog data files**, and **Notype data files**. Each dataset is described in terms of its collection method, the number of files, and the type of data included.

1. **Defog Dataset**: This dataset consists of time-series acceleration data collected from Parkinson’s Disease patients during FOG-provoking test protocols. There are 91 files, each with an average of 148,634 timeframes, containing vertical, mediolateral, and anteroposterior acceleration values.

2. **Tdcsfog Dataset**: This dataset includes 833 files of time-series acceleration data collected in a medical lab, with each file averaging 8,479 timeframes. Similar to the Defog dataset, it contains vertical, mediolateral, and anteroposterior acceleration values.

3. **Notype Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the Defog dataset, containing 46 files with an average of 222,850 timeframes per file. However, it lacks specific annotations for the types of FOG events.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The authors reference the **Michael J. Fox Foundation** as the source for the datasets, which is crucial for proper citation.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Defog Dataset** and **Tdcsfog Dataset**, the citation is:
  > "Parkinson’s Freezing of Gait Prediction." Michael J. Fox Foundation, 2023, [Online]. Available: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tlvmc-parkinsons-freezing-gait-prediction.

- The **Notype Dataset** is also part of the same source, so it shares the same citation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citation is included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, ready for further processing or review.
