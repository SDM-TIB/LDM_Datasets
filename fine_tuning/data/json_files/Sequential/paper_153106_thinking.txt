To extract datasets from the research paper titled "System Misuse Detection via Informed Behavior Clustering and Modeling" by Linara Adilova et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their approach on a dataset containing logs of interactions with an administrative interface. This suggests that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will examine the **experiments** and **evaluation** sections, as these typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In the **evaluation section**, the authors mention that the dataset was recorded for 31 days and consists of approximately 15,000 sessions performed by 1,400 users with almost 300 different actions. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

I will also look for any specific names or identifiers for the dataset. The authors refer to the dataset as the one provided by their corporate partner in the DiSIEM project, but they do not provide a formal name for it. Therefore, I will note it as the "DiSIEM Project Dataset" for clarity.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if there are any citations related to the dataset. The authors mention that they plan to compare their approach to publicly available datasets in the future, specifically mentioning the ADFA dataset. This indicates that while they primarily use their dataset, they acknowledge the existence of other datasets relevant to their research.

The full citation for the ADFA dataset is:
> G. Creech and J. Hu, “Generation of a new IDS test dataset: Time to retire the KDD collection,” in 2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC), pp. 4487–4492, 2013.

Since the primary dataset used in the paper is not formally named, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **DiSIEM Project Dataset**: Contains logs of interactions with an administrative interface, recorded over 31 days, with approximately 15,000 sessions and 1,400 users.

2. **ADFA Dataset**: Mentioned for future comparisons, it is a publicly available dataset relevant to intrusion detection.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I have captured all necessary details and citations for future reference or processing.
