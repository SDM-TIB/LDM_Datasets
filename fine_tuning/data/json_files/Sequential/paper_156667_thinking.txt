To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AnchorGT: Efficient and Flexible Attention Architecture for Scalable Graph Transformers" by Wenhao Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors specifically mention the datasets used for their evaluations. I will focus on this section to gather detailed information about each dataset, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant metrics or splits used in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention a total of **seven datasets** for graph representation learning and **four datasets** for node representation learning. Here are the datasets identified:

1. **ogb-PCQM4Mv2**: This dataset is sourced from the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) and is used for graph-level tasks.
2. **QM9**: A dataset from MoleculeNet, used for molecular property prediction tasks.
3. **QM8**: Another dataset from MoleculeNet, similar to QM9 but with different properties.
4. **LRGB-Peptides-struct**: A dataset focused on structural properties of peptides.
5. **LRGB-Peptides-func**: A dataset focused on functional properties of peptides.
6. **CLUSTER**: A dataset used for clustering tasks in graph representation learning.
7. **Citeseer**: A citation network dataset used for node-level tasks.
8. **Pubmed**: A dataset consisting of scientific publications, also used for node-level tasks.
9. **ogbn-arxiv**: A dataset from OGB, used for node-level tasks.
10. **ogbn-products**: Another dataset from OGB, used for node-level tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, the citation for the **QM9 dataset** is:
> Wu, Z., Ramsundar, B., Feinberg, E. N., Gomes, J., Geniesse, C., Pappu, A. S., Leswing, K., & Pande, V. (2018). Moleculenet: A benchmark for molecular machine learning. *Chemical Science*, 9(2), 513-530.

Similarly, I will gather citations for the other datasets mentioned, ensuring that I have the correct authors, titles, publication venues, and years.

After compiling the dataset information and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its citation included.

This systematic approach will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, providing a comprehensive overview for future reference or analysis.
