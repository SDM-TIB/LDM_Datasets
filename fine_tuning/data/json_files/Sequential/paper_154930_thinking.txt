To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking of AlphaStar" by Ruo-Ze Liu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments or analysis. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

Next, I will look into the **main body of the paper**, particularly focusing on sections that discuss experiments, methodologies, or results. I will pay special attention to any sections that might be labeled as "Datasets," "Experiments," or similar headings. 

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors refer to several datasets indirectly through discussions of experiments and comparisons with other AI systems. However, they do not provide explicit names of datasets in the main text. Therefore, I will need to check the **References section** for any citations that might correspond to datasets used in the experiments.

In the References section, I will look for any papers or datasets that are cited, particularly those that are known to be associated with AlphaStar or similar AI research in StarCraft II. I will note down the full citations for these references, as they are crucial for documenting the datasets.

For example, if I find references to datasets like "StarCraft II Learning Environment (SC2LE)" or any specific datasets used for training or testing AlphaStar, I will extract their full citations. 

Once I have identified the datasets and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets mentioned in the paper, along with their citations, to provide a comprehensive overview of the data used in the research.
