To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Multimodal Sentiment Analysis via CBAM Attention and Double-layer BiLSTM Architecture" by Huiru Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **MVSA-single dataset** and **HFM dataset**, which suggests these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **materials and methods section**. Here, the authors mention that the **MVSA-single dataset** is used for sentiment analysis tasks, and they provide some context about its emotional polarity. They also reference the **HFM dataset**, indicating its use in their experiments.

In the **data preprocessing section**, the authors describe how they processed the MVSA datasets and mention that they randomly divided the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. This confirms the use of the MVSA-single dataset in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. For the **MVSA-single dataset**, the citation is:
   > Xu, N. (2017). "Analyzing multimodal public sentiment based on hierarchical semantic attentional network." In *2017 IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI)*, pp. 152â€“154.

2. For the **HFM dataset**, the citation is:
   > Wang, H., Li, X., Ren, Z., Ma, C. (2023). "Multimodal sentiment analysis representations learning via contrastive learning with condense attention fusion." *Sensors*, 23(5), 2679.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will facilitate further processing or review of the extracted datasets.
