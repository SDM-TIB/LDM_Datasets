To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Duplex Sequence-to-Sequence Learning for Reversible Machine Translation" by Zaixiang Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on standard translation benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention evaluating their proposal on two standard translation benchmarks:

1. **WMT14 English-German (EN-DE)**: This dataset consists of 4.5 million training pairs, which is a well-known benchmark for machine translation tasks.

2. **WMT16 English-Romanian (EN-RO)**: This dataset contains 610,000 training pairs and is also a recognized benchmark for evaluating translation models.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are typically not included in the main text but are referenced in the context of previous work. 

For the **WMT14 dataset**, the citation is:
> Bojar, O., et al. *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 1–12, 2014.

For the **WMT16 dataset**, the citation is:
> Bojar, O., et al. *Findings of the 2016 Conference on Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the First Conference on Machine Translation, pages 1–12, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
