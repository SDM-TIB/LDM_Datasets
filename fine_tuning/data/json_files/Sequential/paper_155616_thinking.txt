To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Query-Response Interactions by Multi-tasks in Semantic Search for Chatbot Candidate Retrieval" by Libin Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the development of a novel approach for candidate retrieval in chatbots, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the experiments. The introduction provides context about the retrieval-based chatbots and hints at the datasets used for training and evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the provided text, the authors mention that the dataset consists of query-response pairs collected from two sources: the **Douban group** and the **Ubuntu Corpus**. This indicates that these are the primary datasets used in their research.

I will then gather specific details about each dataset:

1. **Douban Dataset**: The authors state that they collected conversational query-response pairs from the Douban group, resulting in 10 million pairs, from which 0.1 million pairs were randomly selected for testing. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

2. **Ubuntu Corpus**: The authors reference the Ubuntu Corpus, which is a well-known dataset for dialogue systems. They mention that it has been processed using a specific script, and its vocabulary size is set to 30,000.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Douban Dataset**, since it is a collection from a social platform, it may not have a formal citation. However, I can note the source as:
  > Douban Group. Available at: https://www.douban.com/group

- For the **Ubuntu Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Lowe, R., Pow, N., Serban, I., & Pineau, J. (2015). The Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus: A Large Dataset for Research in Unstructured Multi-Turn Dialogue Systems. In Proceedings of the SIGDIAL, 285â€“294.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
