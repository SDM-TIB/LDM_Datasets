To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HIFI-WAVEGAN: Generative Adversarial Network with Auxiliary Spectrogram-Phase Loss for High-Fidelity Singing Voice Generation" by Chunhui Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but the details about datasets are likely to be found in the experiments section.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiment)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using an **internal singing dataset** comprising 6,917 pieces sung by a female singer, with durations ranging from 4 to 10 seconds. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed model.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper, particularly in the context of comparisons with other models. However, it appears that the primary dataset used for their experiments is the internal singing dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the internal singing dataset. Since it is an internal dataset, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. However, I will note that the dataset is referred to as "Xiaoicesing2" in the context of the experiments, which is mentioned in the references.

The citation for the Xiaoicesing2 dataset is:
> Chunhui Wang, Chang Zeng, and Xing He. "Xiaoicesing 2: A High-Fidelity Singing Voice Synthesizer Based on Generative Adversarial Network." In Interspeech, 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the internal singing dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
