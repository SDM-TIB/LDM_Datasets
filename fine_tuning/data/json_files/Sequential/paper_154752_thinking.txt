To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bidirectional LSTM-CRF Attention-based Model for Chinese Word Segmentation" by Chen Jin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **PKU** and **MSRA benchmark datasets**, which suggests these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Dataset and Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they evaluated their approach on three datasets: **SogouCA**, **PKU**, and **MSRA**. I will take note of these datasets and look for any additional details provided about them.

In this section, the authors describe **SogouCA** as being provided by SogouLab, while both **PKU** and **MSRA** datasets are sourced from the second International Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff. This information is crucial for understanding the context and origin of the datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For the **PKU dataset**, the citation is:
> Emerson, T. (2005, October). The second international chinese word segmentation bakeoff. In Proceedings of the fourth SIGHAN workshop on Chinese language Processing (Vol. 133).

For the **MSRA dataset**, the citation is also:
> Emerson, T. (2005, October). The second international chinese word segmentation bakeoff. In Proceedings of the fourth SIGHAN workshop on Chinese language Processing (Vol. 133).

For the **SogouCA dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but I will note that it is provided by SogouLab, which may require further investigation to find the original source.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and facilitate further exploration by others interested in this work.
