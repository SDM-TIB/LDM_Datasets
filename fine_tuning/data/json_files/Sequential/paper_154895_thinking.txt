To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Framework for Imbalanced Time-series Forecasting" by Luis P. Silvestrin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to look for specific dataset names and details in the subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of time-series forecasting and mention various applications, but they do not specify any datasets yet. I will continue to the **methodology** section, where they outline their approach to handling imbalanced regression problems.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention the **Motor Temperature Dataset**, which consists of sensor measurements from a steel processing conveyor belt. This dataset is crucial for their case study, and I will extract its details.

The **Motor Temperature Dataset** is described as follows:
- It includes sensor measurements for predicting the temperature of a bridle motor, with data collected every 10 seconds, totaling about 2 million samples. The dataset encompasses various features, including properties of the steel strip and current temperature measurements.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the Motor Temperature Dataset, as it is likely a proprietary dataset provided by Tata Steel Europe for the study. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is used in collaboration with Tata Steel Europe but will not have a formal citation like other publicly available datasets.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the methodology and does not reference additional datasets, I will conclude that the Motor Temperature Dataset is the only dataset extracted from this paper.

Finally, I will summarize the findings:
1. **Motor Temperature Dataset**: Sensor measurements from a steel processing conveyor belt, used for predicting motor temperature. No formal citation available, as it is a proprietary dataset provided by Tata Steel Europe.

With this information, I will prepare to compile the dataset entry into the required format for further processing.
