To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention based Sentence Extraction from Scientific Articles using Pseudo-Labeled data" by Parth Mehta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a collection of articles publicly available through the ACL anthology for their experiments, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the lack of training data in automatic summarization and mention the ACL anthology as a significant corpus of scientific articles with corresponding manually written abstracts. This reinforces the importance of the ACL anthology as a dataset.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors specify that they used a subset of the ACL Anthology corpus, which consists of 27,801 articles published from the year 2000 onwards. They also mention that they used the Science Parse library for extracting section-wise information from the PDF documents. This section provides crucial details about the dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the ACL Anthology corpus. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, as it is a well-known resource in the field. Therefore, I will use the general citation for the ACL Anthology:

- **ACL Anthology**: 
  > ACL Anthology. *A collection of scientific articles in computational linguistics and related domains*. Available at: http://aclweb.org/anthology/

Since the authors did not provide a specific citation for the subset they used, I will note that they utilized a subset of the ACL Anthology corpus without a specific citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include the relevant details and citations for the datasets identified in the paper. This will ensure that the information is clear and ready for further processing or review.
