To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MiLeNAS: Efficient Neural Architecture Search via Mixed-Level Reformulation" by Chaoyang He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted within the convolutional architecture search space, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for architecture search and evaluation, as well as the **ImageNet dataset** for transferability verification. This indicates that both datasets are crucial for their experiments.

I will then look for detailed descriptions of these datasets within the text. The authors provide some context about CIFAR-10, stating that it is used for both the search and evaluation stages, while ImageNet is used to verify the transferability of the learned architectures.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, CiteSeer, 2009.

For the **ImageNet dataset**, the citation is:
> Jonathan Long, Evan Shelhamer, and Trevor Darrell. *Fully convolutional networks for semantic segmentation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 3431â€“3440, 2015.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both datasets. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that they are ready for review or further processing.
