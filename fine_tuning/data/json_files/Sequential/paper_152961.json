The spatial size of this dataset is 145×145 pixels with a spatial resolution of 20 meters per pixel (mpp), and there are 224 spectral bands in the wavelength range from 0.4 to 2.5 µm. After removing the background pixels, 10249 pixels are reserved, which contain useful ground-truth information from 16 different class labels.",
