To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predictive Precoder Design for OTFS-Enabled URLLC: A Deep Learning Approach" by Chang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for simulations or experiments. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. This section typically details the experimental setup, including any datasets used for training or testing the models. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize dataset characteristics.

In the **results section**, the authors may discuss the performance of their models on specific datasets, which can provide additional context about the datasets used. If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, I will review it thoroughly to gather detailed information.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial as it allows me to provide proper attribution for each dataset. I will ensure to note the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset mentioned.

For example, if the paper references a dataset like the "OTFS Channel Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If it is not explicitly cited, I will note that it is a dataset created by the authors for their experiments.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that the citations are complete and formatted correctly for any future use or reference.
