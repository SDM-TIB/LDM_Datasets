To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The XMUSPEECH System for Multi-channel Multi-party Meeting Transcription Challenge" by Jie Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data preparation sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the system and mentions the **AliMeeting corpus**, which is a strong indication that it is a dataset used in the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Data Preparation)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the **AliMeeting corpus**. They describe it as containing **118.75 hours of speech data** collected from **240 meeting audios** using an **8-channel microphone array**. The section specifies the distribution of the dataset into training, evaluation, and test sets, which is crucial for understanding its structure.

In addition to the AliMeeting corpus, the authors mention the use of other datasets for training models, specifically **Aishell-4** and **CN-Celeb**. I will extract details about these datasets as well.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **AliMeeting corpus**: The citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is associated with the M2MeT challenge. I will note that it is part of the challenge and may reference the following:
   > Fan Yu, Shiliang Zhang, Yihui Fu, Lei Xie, Siqi Zheng, Zhihao Du, Weilong Huang, Pengcheng Guo, Zhijie Yan. *M2met: The icassp 2022 multi-channel multi-party meeting transcription challenge*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.07393, 2021.

2. **Aishell-4**: The citation is:
   > Yihui Fu, Luyao Cheng, Shubo Lv, Yukai Jv, Yuxiang Kong, Zhuo Chen, Yanxin Hu, Lei Xie, Jian Wu, Hui Bu, et al. *Aishell-4: An open source dataset for speech enhancement, separation, recognition and speaker diarization in conference scenario*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2104.03603, 2021.

3. **CN-Celeb**: The citation is:
   > Yue Fan, JW Kang, LT Li, KC Li, HL Chen, ST Cheng, PY Zhang, ZY Zhou, YQ Cai, and Dong Wang. *Cn-celeb: a challenging chinese speaker recognition dataset*. In ICASSP 2020-2020 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP). IEEE, 2020, pp. 7604â€“7608.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
