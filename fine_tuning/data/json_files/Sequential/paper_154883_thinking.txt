To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modelling Neuronal Behaviour with Time Series Regression: Recurrent Neural Networks on C. Elegans Data" by GonÃ§alo Mestre et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental setting sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

In the **introduction**, I will look for context about the datasets used, particularly any references to C. Elegans data or specific datasets that might be utilized in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental setting)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Data)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, I will find the names of the datasets and their characteristics. The paper mentions two datasets referred to as "DB1" and "LUAL", which are derived from simulations of a high-fidelity model of the C. Elegans nervous system.

The authors specify that each dataset consists of 40 data files, with one dataset corresponding to a simulation with a time step of 0.5 ms and the other with a time step of 0.1 ms. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' structure and purpose.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

For the datasets mentioned in this paper, I will compile the following citations:

1. **DB1 Dataset**: The dataset is derived from simulations of the C. Elegans nervous system, but the paper does not provide a specific citation for it. However, it is based on the connectome of the adult hermaphrodite of C. Elegans, which is referenced in the paper:
   > Varshney, L. R., Chen, B. L., Paniagua, E., Hall, D. H., & Chklovskii, D. B. (2011). Structural properties of the Caenorhabditis elegans neuronal network. *PLoS Comput Biol*, 7(2), e1001066.

2. **LUAL Dataset**: Similar to DB1, this dataset is also derived from the same simulations and does not have a specific citation. It is also based on the same connectome reference:
   > Varshney, L. R., Chen, B. L., Paniagua, E., Hall, D. H., & Chklovskii, D. B. (2011). Structural properties of the Caenorhabditis elegans neuronal network. *PLoS Comput Biol*, 7(2), e1001066.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing.
