To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identifying Possible Rumor Spreaders on Twitter: A Weak Supervised Learning Approach" by Shakshi Sharma and Rajesh Sharma, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize the **PHEME dataset**, which is a significant clue that I should focus on this dataset.

Next, I will look into **section III (Dataset Description and Methodology)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the PHEME dataset. They mention that this dataset contains rumor and non-rumor tweets related to five specific incidents: Charlie Hebdo, Germanwings crash, Ottawa shooting, Sydney siege, and Ferguson. This section will provide essential details about the dataset's structure and contents.

In **section III-A**, the authors describe the PHEME dataset as comprising five events, with each event represented in separate files containing JSON-formatted data. They also provide a table that outlines the fields included in the dataset, such as user ID, tweet content, follower counts, and labels indicating whether a tweet is a rumor or non-rumor.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the PHEME dataset, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The authors reference the PHEME dataset as follows:
> Zubiaga, A., Aker, A., Bontcheva, K., Liakata, M., & Procter, R. (2018). Detection and resolution of rumours in social media: A survey. ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 51(2), 1-36.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the key details:

1. **PHEME Dataset**: This dataset contains rumor and non-rumor tweets related to five incidents, providing a rich source of information for analyzing rumor spreaders on social media platforms.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately represented for future reference or processing.
