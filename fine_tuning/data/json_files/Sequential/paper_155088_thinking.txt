To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparison of SVD and Factorized TDNN Approaches for Speech to Text" by Jeffrey Josanne Michael et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors report results based on training on the **Fisher dataset** and its reverberated versions. This indicates that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Data)**, where the authors explicitly state that they used the **Fisher dataset** for training. They also mention that they used reverberated versions of this dataset to match target test distributions. This confirms that the Fisher dataset is a primary dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Fisher dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For the **Fisher dataset**, the citation is:
  > Christopher Cieri, David Miller, and Kevin Walker. *The Fisher Corpus: A Resource for the Next Generations of Speech-to-Text*. January 2004.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will focus solely on the Fisher dataset for my extraction.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Fisher dataset as required. This will provide a clear and complete entry for the dataset used in the research.
