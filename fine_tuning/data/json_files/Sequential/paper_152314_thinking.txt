To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Modal Hybrid Deep Neural Network for Speech Enhancement" by Zhenzhou Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental details sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a "novel deep learning model" and hints at the use of an "audiovisual database," which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Details)**, where the authors describe the data used for their experiments. They mention conducting experiments on an "audiovisual dataset consisting of 14 native American English speakers," which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their research.

In this section, they provide additional details about the dataset, including the number of recorded files per speaker and the types of noise used for corruption. However, they do not provide a specific name for the dataset in this section.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the audiovisual dataset mentioned. The authors refer to the dataset as "Audiovisual database of spoken American English" and provide the following citation:

- **Audiovisual database of spoken American English**:
  > Carolyn Richie, Sarah Warburton, and Megan Carter, "Audiovisual database of spoken American English LDC2009V01," Philadelphia: Linguistic Data Consortium, 2009, Web Download.

Additionally, the authors mention extracting nonspeech environmental noises from an online corpus, which they reference as "100 nonspeech sounds." I will also look for the citation for this corpus in the references.

The citation for the nonspeech sounds is:
- **100 nonspeech sounds**:
  > Guoning Hu, "100 nonspeech sounds," http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/pnl/corpus/HuNonspeech/HuCorpus.html, Web Download, Accessed: 2016-03-25.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. Audiovisual database of spoken American English (LDC2009V01)
2. 100 nonspeech sounds

I will ensure that the full citations for each dataset are included in the final output.
