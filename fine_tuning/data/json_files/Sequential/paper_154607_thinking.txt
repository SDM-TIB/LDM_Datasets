To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STA-VPR: Spatio-temporal Alignment for Visual Place Recognition" by Feng Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors performed extensive experiments on five representative VPR datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiment)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention testing their method on four benchmark VPR datasets and one synthetic dataset. I will look for a summary table or detailed descriptions that provide the names and characteristics of these datasets.

In the text, the authors list the datasets as follows:

1. **Nordland Dataset**: Contains 3584 frames for both reference and query, with severe appearance variation and no viewpoint variation.
2. **synth-Nord Dataset**: A synthetic dataset with 3584 frames for both reference and query, exhibiting severe appearance changes but no viewpoint changes.
3. **Gardens Point (GP) Dataset**: This dataset has two variations:
   - **GP(DL&NR)**: 200 frames for both reference and query, with severe appearance variation and minor viewpoint variation.
   - **GP(DL&DR)**: 200 frames for both reference and query, with severe appearance variation and medium viewpoint variation.
4. **UA Dataset**: Contains 646 frames for both reference and query, with severe condition variations and slight viewpoint changes.
5. **Berlin A100 Dataset**: Comprises 85 frames for reference and 81 frames for query, with medium appearance and viewpoint changes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets directly, but I can infer that the datasets are likely referenced in the context of other works. 

For the **Nordland Dataset**, the citation is:
> S. Lowry et al., “Visual place recognition: A survey,” IEEE Trans. Robot., vol. 32, no. 1, pp. 1–19, 2016.

For the **Gardens Point Dataset**, the citation is:
> N. Sunderhauf et al., “On the performance of convnet features for place recognition,” in IROS, 2015, pp. 4297–4304.

For the **UA Dataset**, the citation is:
> C. Li and W. Siu, “Fast monocular visual place recognition for non-uniform vehicle speed and varying lighting environment,” IEEE Trans. Intell. Transp. Syst., pp. 1–18, 2020.

For the **Berlin A100 Dataset**, the citation is:
> Z. Chen et al., “Only look once, mining distinctive landmarks from convnet for visual place recognition,” in IROS, 2017, pp. 9–16.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as I prepare the structured output. This will ensure that all relevant information is accurately captured and ready for further processing or review.
