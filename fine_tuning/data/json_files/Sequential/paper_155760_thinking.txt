To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Eat-Radar: Continuous Fine-Grained Intake Gesture Detection Using FMCW Radar and 3D Temporal Convolutional Network with Attention" by Chunzhuo Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that a public dataset was created, which is a strong indication that there is a dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the part where the authors describe their data collection process. They mention that they created a public dataset comprising **70 meal sessions** from **70 participants**, which includes **4,132 eating gestures and 893 drinking gestures**. This is a clear description of the dataset, including the number of participants and the types of gestures recorded.

I will also check the **results section** to see if there are any additional details about the dataset or its characteristics. The authors provide statistics about the dataset, including the duration of meal sessions and the types of eating styles involved, which further enriches the dataset description.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors provide a persistent identifier link for the dataset, which is crucial for proper citation. The link is:
> https://rdr.kuleuven.be/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.48804/NQSH4F

This indicates that the dataset is publicly available and can be cited using the DOI provided.

To summarize, I will extract the following dataset information:

1. **Dataset Name**: Eat-Radar Dataset
   - **Description**: A public dataset comprising 70 meal sessions from 70 participants, including 4,132 eating gestures and 893 drinking gestures.
   - **Citation**: Wang, C., Kumar, T. S., De Raedt, W., Camps, G., Hallez, H., & Vanrumste, B. (2023). Eat-Radar: Continuous Fine-Grained Intake Gesture Detection Using FMCW Radar and 3D Temporal Convolutional Network with Attention. IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics. DOI: 10.1109/JBHI.2023.3339703.

After gathering this information, I will compile it into a structured format for further use or analysis.
