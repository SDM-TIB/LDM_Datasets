To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recurrent Neural Networks for anomaly detection in the Post-Mortem time series of LHC superconducting magnets" by Maciej Wielgosz et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used high-resolution data from the Post Mortem database, which suggests that this database is a key dataset for their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 6.1, the authors describe the data used for their experiments, stating that they collected signals from the CERN PM database. They mention that the data was divided into three datasets: small, medium, and large, with sizes of 47 MB, 184 MB, and 302 MB, respectively. This is crucial information for identifying the datasets.

I will also check the **conclusion and references sections** to ensure I have the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the Post Mortem database as the source of their data, but I need to confirm if there are specific papers or reports that provide a formal citation for this database.

The full citation for the Post Mortem database is not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is referenced multiple times. I will note that the database is part of the CERN infrastructure, and I can cite it as follows:

- For the **Post Mortem database**, the citation is:
  > E. Ciapala, F. Rodr√≠guez-Mateos, R. Schmidt, J. Wenninger, *The LHC Post-mortem System*, Tech. Rep. LHC-PROJECT-NOTE-303, CERN, Geneva (Oct 2002). URL: http://cds.cern.ch/record/691828

Now, I will compile the dataset entries based on the information gathered:

1. **Small Dataset**: 47 MB, derived from the Post Mortem database.
2. **Medium Dataset**: 184 MB, derived from the Post Mortem database.
3. **Large Dataset**: 302 MB, derived from the Post Mortem database.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the full citation for the Post Mortem database, as it is the source of all three datasets.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each entry is clear and includes the necessary citations.
