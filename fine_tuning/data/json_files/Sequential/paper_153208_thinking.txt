To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structural Health Monitoring of Cantilever Beam: A Case Study - Using Bayesian Neural Network and Deep Learning" by Rahul Vashisht et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the use of vibration-based structural health monitoring (SHM) and mentions that raw frequency response data simulated using finite element analysis is fed into the network. This suggests that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more specific details.

Next, I will examine the **experimental section** (specifically section 2.5, titled "Case Study") where the authors describe the cantilever beam structure and the simulation process. They mention that frequency response analysis is carried out for various damage scenarios, and that the total input data points are 14,641. This indicates that there is a dataset generated from these simulations.

I will also look for any specific names or references to datasets in the **results and discussion** sections. The authors provide details about the data points and how they are structured, but they do not explicitly name a dataset. However, they do mention that the data consists of responses from nodes in the cantilever beam structure.

Now, I will check the **acknowledgements and references sections** to see if there are any citations related to the datasets used. The references primarily cite works related to deep learning and Bayesian neural networks, but they do not provide a specific citation for the dataset generated in this study.

Since the dataset is derived from simulations conducted by the authors, I will create a citation for it based on the information provided in the paper. The dataset can be described as follows:

1. **Cantilever Beam Frequency Response Dataset**: This dataset consists of frequency response data generated from a cantilever beam structure subjected to various damage scenarios. The dataset includes 14,641 data points, each representing a concatenated response vector of length 40,000, derived from the acceleration responses monitored at specific nodes.

Since there is no formal citation for this dataset in the references, I will create a citation that reflects the authors and the context of the study:

> Vashisht, R., Viji, H., Sundararajan, T., Mohankumar, D., & Sumitra, S. (2023). *Structural Health Monitoring of Cantilever Beam: A Case Study - Using Bayesian Neural Network and Deep Learning*. Indian Institute of Space Science & Technology, Thiruvananthapuram, India.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the citation into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that the dataset is properly documented and can be referenced in future work.
