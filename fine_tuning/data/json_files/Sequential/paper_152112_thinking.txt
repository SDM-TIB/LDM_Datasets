To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gated Recurrent Neural Tensor Network" by Andros Tjandra et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments conducted, which may include references to datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) closely, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention using the **PennTreeBank (PTB) corpus** for their experiments, which is a standard benchmark for language modeling tasks. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including how it was divided into training, validation, and test sets.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper, particularly in the context of the experiments or results. If the authors refer to any other datasets, I will make sure to document those as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. For the **PennTreeBank (PTB) corpus**, I will look for the original source or any relevant papers that describe the dataset in detail.

The citation for the PennTreeBank corpus is:
> Marcus, M. P., Santorini, B., & Marcinkiewicz, M. A. (1993). *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2), 313-330.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their descriptions and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Examine the experiments section for detailed descriptions of datasets used.
3. Note any additional datasets mentioned throughout the paper.
4. Retrieve full citations from the references section.
5. Compile the dataset information for clarity and future use.
