To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reconstruction of 3-Axis Seismocardiogram from Right-to-Left and Head-to-Foot Components Using A Long Short-Term Memory Network" by Mohammad Muntasir Rahman and Amirtah`a Taebi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves a dataset obtained from 15 healthy adult subjects, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods section**, particularly the subsection titled **D. SCG Dataset**. Here, the authors describe the dataset preparation process in detail. They mention that the dataset consists of SCG segments collected from 15 participants, with a total of 7492 segments used for training and validation, and 475 segments for testing. This section provides crucial information about the dataset's composition and the methodology used to collect and preprocess the data.

I will also check the **Study Population subsection** to confirm the characteristics of the participants, which adds context to the dataset. The authors provide demographic information about the subjects, which is important for understanding the dataset's applicability.

After gathering the necessary details, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since this dataset is original and created by the authors themselves, it may not have a formal citation like established datasets. Instead, I will note that the dataset is derived from the authors' own research involving 15 healthy adult subjects.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Dataset Name**: SCG Dataset
   - **Description**: The dataset consists of seismocardiogram (SCG) segments collected from 15 healthy adult subjects. A total of 7492 segments were used for training and validation, while 475 segments were used for testing. The segments were preprocessed to eliminate noise and normalized for input into the LSTM model.
   - **Citation**: This dataset is original and created by the authors of the paper, thus it does not have a formal citation.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This step-by-step approach ensures that I accurately capture the dataset details while adhering to the importance of citation.
