To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inter-sequence Enhanced Framework for Personalized Sequential Recommendation" by Feng Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions conducting extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **MovieLens (1M)**: This dataset is a well-known benchmark for recommendation systems, containing 1 million ratings from users on various movies.

2. **Steam**: This dataset is related to user interactions with games on the Steam platform, although the paper does not provide detailed statistics in the experiments section.

3. **MovieLens (20M)**: Another version of the MovieLens dataset, this one contains 20 million ratings, providing a larger scale for testing recommendation algorithms.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **MovieLens (1M)** dataset, the citation is:
> Harsh T. S. and Koren, Y. (2009). *Matrix Factorization Techniques for Recommender Systems*. Computer, 30(8):30-37.

For the **Steam** dataset, I will refer to the original paper that introduced it:
> Kang, W., and McAuley, J. (2018). *Self-attentive Sequential Recommendation*. In IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, ICDM 2018, Singapore, November 17-20, 2018, 197-206.

For the **MovieLens (20M)** dataset, the citation is:
> Harsh T. S. and Koren, Y. (2009). *Matrix Factorization Techniques for Recommender Systems*. Computer, 30(8):30-37.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
