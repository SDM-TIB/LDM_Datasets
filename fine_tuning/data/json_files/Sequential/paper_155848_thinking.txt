To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ImPaKT: A Dataset for Open-Schema Knowledge Base Construction" by Luke Vilnis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the construction of the **ImPaKT dataset**, which is a strong indication that this is the primary dataset discussed in the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Structure of the ImPaKT Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset's contents, including the types of annotations and the number of examples. This section is crucial as it outlines the dataset's structure and purpose, confirming that the **ImPaKT dataset** is indeed the focus of the research.

In addition, I will look for any other datasets that may be referenced in the context of comparisons or related work. The authors mention existing datasets like **MAVE** and **MAE** in the introduction, which could be relevant for citation purposes.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **ImPaKT Dataset**: The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset within the paper, but I will note that it is a new dataset introduced by the authors themselves.

2. **MAVE Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Yang, L., Wang, Q., Yu, Z., Kulkarni, A., Sanghai, S., Shu, B., Elsas, J., & Kanagal, B. (2022). MAVE: A product dataset for multi-source attribute value extraction. In Proceedings of the Fifteenth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM), pages 1256â€“1265.

3. **MAE Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Logan IV, R. L., Humeau, S., & Singh, S. (2017). Multimodal attribute extraction. CoRR, abs/1711.11118.

Next, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the relevant details about each dataset, including their purpose and the context in which they are mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare to format this information into a structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its citation, as this is crucial for proper attribution in any subsequent use of the datasets.
