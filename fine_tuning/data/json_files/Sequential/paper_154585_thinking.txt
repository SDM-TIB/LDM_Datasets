To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Temporal Classification for Weakly Supervised Object Detection" by Chia-Yu Hsu and Wenwen Li, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the method was evaluated on **PASCAL VOC datasets**, which indicates that these datasets are relevant to the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (specifically section 4) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly mention that they evaluated their method on the **PASCAL VOC 2007** and **PASCAL VOC 2012** datasets. This confirms that these datasets are indeed utilized for their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For the **PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2):303–338, 2010.

2. For the **PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge 2012*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 303–338, 2012.

After compiling this information, I will create entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for further processing or review.
