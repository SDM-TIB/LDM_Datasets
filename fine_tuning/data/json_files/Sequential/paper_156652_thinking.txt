To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Kernel Corrector LSTM" by Rodrigo Tuna et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but the experimental setup is likely to contain specific details about the datasets used.

In **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, the authors mention using the **M4 Competition Dataset**. This dataset is described as comprising six subsets, and they specifically evaluate the performance of their algorithms on the **Monthly subset**, which includes 199 time series for performance evaluation and 20 time series for training time evaluation.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the M4 Competition Dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Makridakis, S., Spiliotis, E., Assimakopoulos, V. (2018). *The M4 Competition: Results, findings, conclusion and way forward*. International Journal of Forecasting, 34(4), 802â€“808. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijforecast.2018.06.001

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **M4 Competition Dataset**: This dataset consists of six subsets, and the authors specifically evaluate the performance of their algorithms on the Monthly subset, which includes 199 time series for performance evaluation and 20 time series for training time evaluation.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset and its citation, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or processing.
