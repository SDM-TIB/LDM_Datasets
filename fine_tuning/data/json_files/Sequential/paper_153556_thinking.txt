To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Robust Toxic Content Classification" by Keita Kurita et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for robust classifiers against adversarial attacks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **Task and Datasets** section, where the authors summarize the datasets used in their research. Here, they mention three specific datasets:

1. **Jigsaw 2018 Dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately 215,000 annotated comments from Wikipedia talk pages, labeled for various types of toxicity. 

2. **Jigsaw 2019 Dataset**: This dataset extends the Jigsaw 2018 dataset with 1.8 million comments, each annotated by multiple annotators for various labels, including a toxicity score.

3. **OffensEval 2019 Dataset**: This dataset includes 13,240 tweets annotated for offensiveness and whether the content is targeted.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Jigsaw 2018 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jigsaw. *Jigsaw 2018 Toxic Comment Classification Challenge*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge.

- For the **Jigsaw 2019 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jigsaw. *Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/overview.

- For the **OffensEval 2019 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Z. Waseem and D. Hovy. *Hateful Symbols or Hateful People? Predictive Features for Hate Speech Detection on Twitter*. In Proceedings of the SRW (HLT-NAACL), 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have a clear record of the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
