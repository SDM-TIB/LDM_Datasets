To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comparison of Word-based and Context-based Representations for Classification Problems in Health Informatics" by Aditya Joshi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors compare different representations for three classification problems in health informatics, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** section, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention three classification problems: 

1. **Influenza Infection Classification (IIC)**
2. **Drug Usage Classification (DUC)**
3. **Personal Health Mention Classification (PHMC)**

In the **experiment setup** section, the authors provide details about the datasets used for each classification problem. They mention that the datasets consist of tweets that have been manually annotated. The statistics for each dataset are summarized in Table 2, which includes the number of tweets and the number of true tweets for each classification problem.

Now, I will extract the specific datasets mentioned:

1. **Influenza Infection Classification (IIC)**: The dataset is sourced from the work of Lamb et al. (2013b).
2. **Drug Usage Classification (DUC)**: The dataset is provided by Jiang et al. (2016).
3. **Personal Health Mention Classification (PHMC)**: The dataset is provided by Robinson et al. (2015).

Next, I will look in the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **IIC dataset** from Lamb et al. (2013b), the citation is:
  > Alex Lamb, Michael J. Paul, and Mark Dredze. *Separating fact from fear: Tracking flu infections on Twitter*. In North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 789–795, Atlanta, Georgia.

- For the **DUC dataset** from Jiang et al. (2016), the citation is:
  > Keyuan Jiang, Ricardo Calix, and Matrika Gupta. *Construction of a personal experience tweet corpus for health surveillance*. In ACL Workshop on biomedical natural language processing, pages 128–135, Berlin, Germany.

- For the **PHMC dataset** from Robinson et al. (2015), the citation is:
  > Bella Robinson, Ross Sparks, Robert Power, and Mark Cameron. *Social media monitoring for health indicators*. In International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, Gold Coast, Australia.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
