To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hyperrealistic Image Inpainting with Hypergraphs" by Gourav Wadhwa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that their experiments were conducted on four publicly available datasets, which indicates that I should look for these datasets in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4.2) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they mention:

1. **CelebA-HQ**: A dataset containing 30,000 images of faces, with 28,000 images used for training and 2,000 for testing.
2. **Paris Street View**: This dataset consists of 14,900 images for training and 100 for testing.
3. **Facades Dataset**: Contains 400 training images, 100 validation images, and 106 testing images.
4. **Places2**: A large dataset with 1.6 million training images from 365 scenes, with specific details on the number of images per category.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

The citations I will look for are:

- For **CelebA-HQ**, the citation is:
  > Tero Karras, Timo Aila, Samuli Laine, and Jaakko Lehtinen. *Progressive growing of gans for improved quality stability, and variation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.10196, 2017.

- For **Paris Street View**, the citation is:
  > Doersch, A C. Singh, S. Gupta, Sivic J., and A Efros. *What makes paris look like paris?* In ACM Transactions on Graphics 31(4), 2012.

- For **Facades Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alexei A Efros and Thomas K Leung. *Texture synthesis by non-parametric sampling*. In Proceedings of the seventh IEEE international conference on computer vision, 1999.

- For **Places2**, the citation is:
  > Zhou B., Lapedriza A., Khosla A., A. Oliva, and Torralba A. *Places: A 10 million image database for scene recognition*. In IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2017.

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details for future reference or analysis.
