To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hedging Properties of Algorithmic Investment Strategies using Long Short-Term Memory and Time Series models for Equity Indices" by Jakub Micha≈Ñkow et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a summary of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for analysis.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of various asset classes, including energy commodities, precious metals, cryptocurrencies, and soft commodities, in their algorithmic investment strategies. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly the subsection titled "Data Selection." Here, the authors mention that they focus on logarithmic returns using daily data for several assets, specifically:

1. **S&P 500 Index (SPX)**: Data from 2004-01-02 to 2022-03-29.
2. **Bitcoin (BTC)**: Data from 2004-01-02 to 2022-03-29.
3. **Gold (GLD)**: Data from 2004-01-02 to 2022-03-29.
4. **Natural Gas (UNG)**: Data from 2004-01-02 to 2022-03-29.
5. **Wheat (ZWF)**: Data from 2004-01-02 to 2022-03-29.

The authors also mention that they use hourly data for SPX and UNG, but the availability of this data is restricted for extensive time periods, indicating that proprietary data was used.

Next, I will check the **results section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors provide further details about the datasets used in their experiments. However, the results primarily focus on the performance metrics of the strategies rather than introducing new datasets.

Finally, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are derived from publicly available financial data, the authors do not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves. Instead, they reference the methodologies and models used in their analysis.

Based on this analysis, I will compile the dataset entries as follows:

1. **S&P 500 Index (SPX)**: Daily data from 2004-01-02 to 2022-03-29.
2. **Bitcoin (BTC)**: Daily data from 2004-01-02 to 2022-03-29.
3. **Gold (GLD)**: Daily data from 2004-01-02 to 2022-03-29.
4. **Natural Gas (UNG)**: Daily data from 2004-01-02 to 2022-03-29.
5. **Wheat (ZWF)**: Daily data from 2004-01-02 to 2022-03-29.

Since the datasets are based on financial market data, I will note that they are publicly available and do not have specific citations. However, I will ensure to mention the time periods and types of data used for each asset.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing.
