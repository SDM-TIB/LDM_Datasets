To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GAN Compression: Efficient Architectures for Interactive Conditional GANs" by Muyang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and may mention datasets used in prior work or the current study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Setups)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will look for specific names of datasets and any relevant details such as the number of images, types of tasks, or any unique characteristics of the datasets.

In this paper, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Edges→shoes**: This dataset consists of 50,025 images from the UT Zappos50K dataset, which is used for evaluating the Pix2pix and MUNIT models. The dataset is split into a training set and a validation set.

2. **Cityscapes**: This dataset contains images of German street scenes, with 2,975 images for training and 500 for validation. It is used to evaluate both the Pix2pix and GauGAN models.

3. **Horse↔zebra**: This dataset consists of 1,187 horse images and 1,474 zebra images, originally sourced from ImageNet. It is used for evaluating the CycleGAN model.

4. **Map↔aerial photo**: This dataset contains 2,194 images scraped from Google Maps, used for evaluating the Pix2pix model.

5. **COCO-Stuff**: This dataset is derived from the COCO dataset and includes 118,000 training images and 5,000 validation images. It is used to evaluate the GauGAN model.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
