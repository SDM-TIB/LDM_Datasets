To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Audio to Body Dynamics" by Eli Shlizerman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used for training and evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they built an LSTM network trained on videos of violin and piano recitals. This indicates that there are specific datasets related to these performances.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets they used. Here, they mention two main categories of data:

1. **Violin Recitals**: The authors collected a total of 3.6 hours of videos featuring violin performances. They emphasize the importance of selecting high-quality videos with clear audio and minimal background noise.

2. **Piano Recitals**: Similarly, they gathered 4.4 hours of piano recital videos under the same quality criteria.

The authors also note that all videos were sourced from the Internet, specifically YouTube, and that they processed these videos to detect body movements and keypoints.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for any specific citations related to the datasets. However, since the datasets are primarily composed of videos sourced from YouTube, the authors may not provide formal citations for each individual video. Instead, they mention that the full list of URLs is available in the supplementary material, which I will need to reference.

The citations for the datasets can be summarized as follows:

- **Violin Recitals**: The dataset consists of various videos of violin performances sourced from YouTube. Specific URLs are provided in the supplementary material.
  
- **Piano Recitals**: Similar to the violin dataset, this consists of videos of piano performances, also sourced from YouTube, with URLs available in the supplementary material.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the necessary details and citations as outlined above. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.
