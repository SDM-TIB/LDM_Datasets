To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dialogue Meaning Representation for Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems" by Xiangkun Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the annotation of a dataset called **DMR-FastFood**, which is a strong indicator that this is a key dataset in the paper. The introduction further elaborates on the purpose of the dataset, indicating that it contains over 70,000 utterances annotated with rich linguistic semantics.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** or **Data** section, which is typically where authors describe the datasets they used or created. In this paper, there is a **Data** section that provides detailed information about the **DMR-FastFood** dataset. 

In this section, the authors state that the DMR-FastFood dataset consists of **7,194 dialogues** and **70,328 annotated utterances**. It is specifically annotated for the fast-food domain and includes various linguistic semantics such as conjunctions and negations. This section confirms that DMR-FastFood is the primary dataset discussed in the paper.

Now, I will check the **References** section to find the full citation for the DMR-FastFood dataset. The authors reference the original dataset they derived from, which is the **MultiDoGO dataset** by Peskov et al. (2019). The citation for this dataset is crucial for proper attribution.

The citation for the **MultiDoGO dataset** is:
> Denis Peskov, Nancy Clarke, Jason Krone, Brigi Fodor, Yi Zhang, Adel Youssef, and Mona Diab. *Multi-domain goal-oriented dialogues (MultiDoGO): Strategies toward curating and annotating large scale dialogue data*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), pages 4526â€“4536, Hong Kong, China. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, ensuring that I include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will ensure that the information is clear and properly attributed for any future use or reference.
