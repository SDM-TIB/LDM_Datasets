To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Existence of a Sample Mean in Dynamic Time Warping Spaces" by Brijnesh Jain and David Schultz, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often contextualizes the research, which may include mentions of datasets used for validation or experimentation.

Next, I will specifically look for sections that might detail the datasets used, such as **"Experiments," "Methodology," or "Datasets."** These sections typically contain explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the paper includes figures or tables, I will also check these for any dataset-related information.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will take note of their names and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, types of data, and any specific attributes that are highlighted.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the complete citation format as presented in the references, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references, which might look something like:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of use. This will ensure that all relevant information is organized and accessible for future reference or analysis.
