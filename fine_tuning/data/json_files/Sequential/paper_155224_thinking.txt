To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Passage to India: Pre-trained Word Embeddings for Indian Languages" by Kumar Saurav et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created multiple word embeddings for 14 Indian languages, which suggests that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Dataset and Experiment Setup)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used. Here, the authors mention that they collected pre-training data for 14 Indian languages, including Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Konkani, Malayalam, Marathi, Nepali, Odiya, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Tamil, and Telugu. They also provide statistics about the corpus size for each language, which is crucial for understanding the datasets.

The authors reference the **ILCI corpora** (Choudhary and Jha, 2011; Bansal et al., 2013) as a source for parallel aligned corpora, which is significant for their work. They also mention using **Wikipedia dumps** as a baseline dataset, which is another important dataset to note.

In **section 3.2 (Experiment Setup)**, the authors describe the evaluation datasets used for tasks such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging. They mention using datasets from the **Universal Dependency (UD) treebank** (Nivre et al., 2016) for UPOS and XPOS tagging, and a specific NER dataset collected from **Murthy et al. (2018)** and the **FIRE 2014 workshop**.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **ILCI Corpora**:
   - Choudhary, N., & Jha, G. N. (2011). Creating multilingual parallel corpora in Indian languages. In Language and Technology Conference, pages 527–537. Springer.
   - Bansal, A., Banerjee, E., & Jha, G. N. (2013). Corpora creation for Indian language technologies – the ILCI project. In the sixth Proceedings of Language Technology Conference (LTC ‘13).

2. **Wikipedia Dumps**:
   - No specific citation is provided for the Wikipedia dumps in the paper, but it is commonly referenced as a source for various NLP tasks.

3. **Universal Dependency (UD) Treebank**:
   - Nivre, J., De Marneffe, M.-C., Ginter, F., Goldberg, Y., Hajic, J., Manning, C. D., McDonald, R., Petrov, S., Pyysalo, S., Silveira, N., et al. (2016). Universal dependencies v1: A multilingual treebank collection. In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’16), pages 1659–1666.

4. **NER Dataset**:
   - Murthy, R., Khapra, M. M., & Bhattacharyya, P. (2018). Improving NER tagging performance in low-resource languages via multilingual learning. ACM Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing (TALLIP), 18(2):9.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a clear format for further processing or review. This structured approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately from the research paper.
