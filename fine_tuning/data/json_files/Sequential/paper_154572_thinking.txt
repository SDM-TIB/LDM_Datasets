To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extreme Volatility Prediction in Stock Market: When GameStop meets Long Short-Term Memory Networks" by Yigit Alparslan and Edward Kim, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the analysis of GameStop (GME) stock and compares it to SPY, indicating that these stocks are the focus of the study. However, it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any references to datasets. The introduction provides context about the volatility of GME stock but does not specify any datasets.

Moving on to **section 3 (Methodology)**, I will focus on **subsection 3.1 (Data)**, where the authors describe the data used in their study. Here, they mention that they study the adjusted close market prices for GME and SPY from February 13, 2002, to February 12, 2021. This indicates that the dataset consists of historical stock price data for these two stocks.

In this section, I will note the specifics of the dataset:
- **Dataset Name**: GME and SPY Stock Prices
- **Description**: The dataset includes adjusted close market prices for GameStop (GME) and SPY from February 13, 2002, to February 12, 2021.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. However, since the dataset consists of stock prices, it may not have a formal citation like traditional datasets. Instead, I will note that the data is likely sourced from financial market data providers or exchanges.

Since the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **GME and SPY Stock Prices**: 
   - Description: Adjusted close market prices for GameStop (GME) and SPY from February 13, 2002, to February 12, 2021.
   - Citation: No formal citation provided; data likely sourced from financial market data providers.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the study, even if they do not have formal citations.
