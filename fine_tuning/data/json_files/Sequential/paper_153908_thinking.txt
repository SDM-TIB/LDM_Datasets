To extract datasets from the research paper titled "L2R2: Leveraging Ranking for Abductive Reasoning" by Yunchang Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the **ART dataset**, which is a strong indication that it is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss their experimental settings. In **section 4.1**, they explicitly state that they conducted experiments on the **ART dataset**, describing it as the first large-scale benchmark dataset for abductive reasoning in narrative texts. They provide details about the dataset, including that it consists of approximately 20,000 pairs of observations with over 200,000 explanatory hypotheses.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ART dataset. The authors reference the ART dataset in the context of their experiments, and I will ensure to capture the citation accurately.

The citation for the ART dataset is:
> Chandra Bhagavatula, Ronan Le Bras, Chaitanya Malaviya, Keisuke Sakaguchi, Ari Holtzman, Hannah Rashkin, Doug Downey, Wen tau Yih, and Yejin Choi. *Abductive Commonsense Reasoning*. In ICLR, 2020.

Now, I will summarize the findings:

1. **ART Dataset**: This dataset is crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper. It is described as a large-scale benchmark for abductive reasoning, consisting of narrative texts and hypotheses.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset and its citation, ensuring that I have accurately captured the necessary details for further processing or review.
