To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Collective Anomaly Detection based on Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network" by LoÃ¯c Bontemps et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a model for collective anomaly detection and mention using the **KDD 1999 dataset** for their experiments. This suggests that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In this section, they specifically mention the **KDD 1999 dataset** and describe its characteristics, including that it was collected from a simulated military-like environment and contains various types of attacks, particularly focusing on the Neptune attack in Denial-of-Service (DoS).

The authors also explain how they converted the original dataset into a time series format for their model. This is crucial information that helps in understanding how the dataset was utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the KDD 1999 dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> KDD Cup Dataset (1999), available at the following website http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html

Since the KDD 1999 dataset is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about it.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset details, including its name, description, and citation, ensuring that the citation is complete and correctly formatted. This will allow for proper referencing in any subsequent analysis or application of the findings from the paper.
