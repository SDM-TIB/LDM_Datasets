To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Universal Neural Vocoding with Parallel WaveNet" by Yunlong Jiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental protocol sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions testing the vocoder on "43 internal speakers" and "more than 300 open-source voices," which indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental protocol section** (Section 3), where the authors describe their training and evaluation protocol. They mention a "multi-speaker multi-lingual training set" consisting of 78 different internal voices and also refer to specific test sets used for evaluation.

In **Table 1**, the authors summarize the statistics of the test sets, which include:

1. **LibriTTS-clean**: A high-quality multi-speaker corpus of English speech in audiobook reading style.
2. **LibriTTS-other**: Another set from the LibriTTS corpus, but with different recording conditions.
3. **Common Voice**: A database of multi-lingual multi-speaker user recordings.

I will also check the **results section** (Section 4) where the authors discuss the performance of their vocoder on these datasets, confirming their relevance.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for these datasets:

- For **LibriTTS**, the citation is:
  > H. Zen, V. Dang, R. Clark, et al. "LibriTTS: A corpus derived from librispeech for text-to-speech." In Interspeech, 2019, pp. 1526â€“1530.

- For **Common Voice**, the citation is:
  > Common Voice Database, "https://voice.mozilla.org/," March, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, ready for further processing or review.
