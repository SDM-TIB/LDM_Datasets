To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Are Labels Necessary for Neural Architecture Search?" by Chenxi Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference specific datasets that are relevant to their work. I will look for any mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation.

In the **experiments section**, particularly in **section 4 (Experiments Overview)** and **section 5 (Sample-Based Experiments)**, the authors describe the methodologies and datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will look for specific names of datasets and any relevant details about them.

From my reading, I identify the following datasets used in the experiments:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset is mentioned as a commonly used dataset for classification tasks. It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.

2. **ImageNet**: Specifically, the authors refer to ImageNet-1K (IN1K) and ImageNet-22K (IN22K). IN1K contains 1.2 million images across 1,000 categories, while IN22K includes approximately 14 million images across 22,000 categories.

3. **Cityscapes**: This dataset is used for semantic segmentation tasks and contains street scene images with pixel-level annotations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Tech. rep., Citeseer.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248–255.

- For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:
  > Cordts, M., Omran, M., Ramos, S., Rehfeld, T., Enzweiler, M., Benenson, R., Franke, U., Roth, S., & Schiele, B. (2016). *The Cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3213–3223.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for clarity and reference.
