To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EmMixformer: Mix transformer for eye movement recognition" by Huafeng Qin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on their own eye movement dataset as well as two public datasets, which suggests that there are specific datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention building a low-frequency eye tracking dataset using Tobii Pro glasses, which they refer to as **EMglasses**. This dataset is crucial as it is self-built and publicly available, aimed at promoting research in eye movement recognition.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors explicitly mention two public datasets: **GazeBase** and **JuDo1000**. I will gather details about these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were used in the experiments.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset:

1. **EMglasses**: This dataset was collected using Tobii Pro glasses at a sampling frequency of 50 Hz from 203 volunteers. It is designed to be more representative of real-world scenarios as participants were not required to stabilize their heads.

2. **GazeBase**: This dataset consists of eye movement recordings from 322 volunteers using the EyeLink1000 eye-tracker. It includes various tasks and was collected over a period of 37 months.

3. **JuDo1000**: This dataset contains eye movement data from 150 volunteers, recorded using an EyeLink Portable Duo eye tracker at a sampling frequency of 1,000 Hz. Each participant completed four experimental sessions.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **EMglasses**, since it is a self-built dataset, I will note that it is publicly available but may not have a formal citation yet.
  
- For **GazeBase**, the citation is:
  > Griffith, H. K., Lohr, D. J., Abdulin, E., & Komogortsev, O. V. (2020). GazeBase, a large-scale, multi-stimulus, longitudinal eye movement dataset. *Scientific Data*, 8, 2020.

- For **JuDo1000**, the citation is:
  > Lohr, D. J., Griffith, H. K., & Komogortsev, O. V. (2021). Eye know you: Metric learning for end-to-end biometric authentication using eye movements from a longitudinal dataset. *IEEE Transactions on Biometrics, Behavior, and Identity Science*, 4, 276â€“288.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured manner, ensuring that all relevant information is included for each dataset extracted from the paper.
