To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Fashion Compatibility with Bidirectional LSTMs" by Xintong Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a newly collected dataset, which suggests that there is a specific dataset that needs to be detailed.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention the **Polyvore dataset**, which is crucial for their experiments. I will gather details about this dataset, including its size, structure, and any specific characteristics mentioned in the paper.

In the **Datasets** section, the authors describe the **Polyvore dataset** as containing 21,889 outfits, split into training, validation, and testing sets. They also mention that the dataset includes rich multimodal information such as images and descriptions of fashion items, which is essential for understanding its application in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Polyvore dataset. The paper states that the dataset is collected from the Polyvore website, but it does not provide a formal citation for it. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is derived from user-generated content on Polyvore, which is a popular fashion website.

Since the dataset is not formally published in a separate paper, I will document it as follows:

- **Polyvore Dataset**: Collected from the Polyvore website, containing 21,889 outfits, with 17,316 for training, 1,497 for validation, and 3,076 for testing. The dataset includes 164,379 items, each with a corresponding image and text description.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the necessary details and citations for the dataset. Since the Polyvore dataset does not have a formal citation, I will note its source as the Polyvore website.

After completing these steps, I will have a clear and comprehensive entry for the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
