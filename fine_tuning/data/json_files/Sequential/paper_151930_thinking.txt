To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Peephole: Predicting Network Performance Before Training" by Boyang Deng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenges of network design and the need for effective evaluation methods, but they do not specify any datasets yet. I will continue to the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed.

In **section 5 (Experiments)**, the authors explicitly state that they tested their method on two public datasets: **CIFAR-10** and **MNIST**. They describe CIFAR-10 as a dataset for object classification and MNIST as a dataset for handwritten digit classification. This section confirms that these datasets are indeed used for their empirical studies.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources.

For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
> Krizhevsky, A., Nair, V., & Hinton, G. (2009). CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. Retrieved from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

For **MNIST**, the citation is:
> LeCun, Y., Cortes, C., & Burges, C. J. (1998). The MNIST database of handwritten digits. 

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation.

In summary, I have extracted the following datasets from the paper:

1. **CIFAR-10**
   - Citation: Krizhevsky, A., Nair, V., & Hinton, G. (2009). CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. Retrieved from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

2. **MNIST**
   - Citation: LeCun, Y., Cortes, C., & Burges, C. J. (1998). The MNIST database of handwritten digits.

With this information, I am ready to present the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
