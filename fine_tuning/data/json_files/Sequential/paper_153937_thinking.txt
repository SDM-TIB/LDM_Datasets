To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transfer Learning for British Sign Language Modelling" by Boris Mocialov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors are working with a BSL monolingual corpus and the Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset, which suggests that these are the primary datasets involved in their research.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Corpora)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset**: This dataset is described as a monolingual corpus consisting of telephone speech, newswire, microphone speech, and transcribed speech. The authors note that it has been preprocessed to eliminate letters, numbers, or punctuation.

2. **BSL Corpus**: This dataset contains video conversations among deaf native, near-native, and fluent signers across the UK. The authors specify that the corpus is annotated for thirty seconds each at the gloss level using the ELAN annotation tool.

In **section 3.1 (Data Pre-processing)**, the authors discuss how they processed the BSL corpus, which further confirms its significance in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset**, the citation is:
  > Merity, S., Keskar, N. S., & Socher, R. (2017). *Regularizing and Optimizing LSTM Language Models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.02182.

- For the **BSL Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Schembri, A., Fenlon, J., Rentelis, R., Reynolds, S., & Cormier, K. (2013). *Building the British Sign Language corpus*. Language Documentation and Conservation, 7.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets relevant to the research and their proper citations for reference.
