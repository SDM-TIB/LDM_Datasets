To extract datasets from the research paper titled "State-of-the-art Chinese Word Segmentation with Bi-LSTMs" by Ji Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved better accuracy on popular datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they list several datasets:

1. **Chinese Penn Treebank 6.0 (CTB6)**: This dataset is noted for its official data split.
2. **Chinese Penn Treebank 7.0 (CTB7)**: The authors mention using the recommended data split from Wang et al. (2011).
3. **Chinese Universal Treebank (UD)**: This dataset is sourced from the CoNLL 2017 shared task, with the official data split.
4. **Dataset from SIGHAN 2005 bake-off task**: The authors refer to this dataset but do not provide a specific citation in the text.

I will also check the **statistics table (Table 1)** for additional details about the datasets, such as the number of tokens and splits, which can provide context for their usage.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For **Chinese Penn Treebank 6.0 (CTB6)**, the citation is:
  > Wang, Y., Kazama, J., Tsuruoka, Y., Chen, W., Zhang, Y., & Torisawa, K. (2011). Improving Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging with semi-supervised methods using large auto-analyzed data. In Proceedings of the 5th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing, pages 309–317, Chiang Mai, Thailand. Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing.

- For **Chinese Penn Treebank 7.0 (CTB7)**, the citation is the same as CTB6 since it is also from Wang et al. (2011).

- For **Chinese Universal Treebank (UD)**, the citation is:
  > Zeman, D., Popel, M., Straka, M., Hajic, J., Nivre, J., Ginter, F., et al. (2017). CoNLL 2017 shared task: Multilingual parsing from raw text to universal dependencies. In Proceedings of the CoNLL 2017 Shared Task: Multilingual Parsing from Raw Text to Universal Dependencies, pages 1–19, Vancouver, Canada. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **SIGHAN 2005 bake-off task**, the citation is:
  > Emerson, T. (2005). The SIGHAN 2005 Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff. In Proceedings of the 4th SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing, pages 1–8.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
