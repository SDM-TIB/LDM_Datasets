To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Integrating Knowledge into End-to-End Speech Recognition from External Text-Only Data" by Ye Bai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on two public Chinese datasets, **AISHELL-1** and **AISHELL-2**, which indicates that these datasets are significant for the research.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors provide specific information about both datasets:

1. **AISHELL-1**: This dataset contains 178 hours of Mandarin speech recorded with a high-fidelity microphone. It is divided into training, development, and test sets, with specific numbers of utterances and speakers mentioned.

2. **AISHELL-2**: This dataset contains about 1000 hours of Mandarin speech recorded using various devices, including iPhones and high-fidelity microphones. Similar to AISHELL-1, it is also divided into training, development, and test sets.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **AISHELL-1**, the citation is:
  > H. Bu, J. Du, X. Na, B. Wu, and H. Zheng. "AISHELL-1: An open-source Mandarin speech corpus and a speech recognition baseline." In 2017 20th Conference of the Oriental Chapter of the International Coordinating Committee on Speech Databases and Speech I/O Systems and Assessment (O-COCOSDA), pp. 1â€“5, 2017.

- For **AISHELL-2**, the citation is:
  > J. Du, X. Na, X. Liu, and H. Bu. "AISHELL-2: Transforming Mandarin ASR research into industrial scale." arXiv preprint arXiv:1808.10583, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
