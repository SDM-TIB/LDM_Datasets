To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can Entropy Explain Successor Surprisal Effects in Reading?" by Marten van Schijndel and Tal Linzen, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on reading time and successor surprisal, but I need to look for specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the relationship between predictability and reading time, but they do not mention any datasets directly. I will continue to the **method section**, where the authors describe the language model and the data used for their experiments.

In **section 3 (Method)**, the authors specify that they used the **Natural Stories Corpus** for their analysis. They describe this corpus as consisting of 10 texts with 485 sentences, collected from 181 native English speakers. This is a clear identification of a dataset used in their research.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Natural Stories Corpus**. The citation provided in the references is:

- **Natural Stories Corpus**:
  > Richard Futrell, Edward Gibson, Hal Tily, Anastasia Vishnevetsky, Steve Piantadosi, and Evelina Fedorenko. *The natural stories corpus*. In Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pages 76â€“82, 2018.

Additionally, I will verify if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to the **Gigaword corpus** for unigram frequencies in the **results section**. I will also look for its citation in the references.

The citation for the **Gigaword corpus** is:
- **Gigaword Corpus**:
  > David Graff and Christopher Cieri. *English Gigaword LDC2003T05*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. The datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Natural Stories Corpus**: A dataset used for reading time analysis, consisting of 10 texts and 485 sentences.
2. **Gigaword Corpus**: A dataset used for estimating unigram frequencies.

I will ensure that the full citations for both datasets are included in the final output.
