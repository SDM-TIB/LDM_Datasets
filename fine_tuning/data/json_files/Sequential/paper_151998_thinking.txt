To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model-free prediction of noisy chaotic time series by Deep Learning" by Kyongmin Yeo, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a deep learning model for predicting chaotic dynamical systems from noisy observations, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the author describes the experiments conducted. The paper mentions testing the LSTM model against noisy observations of two specific chaotic dynamical systems: the **Mackey-Glass equation** and the **Ikeda equation**. However, these are not datasets in the traditional sense; they are mathematical models used to generate time series data.

To clarify, I will look for any mention of how the data was generated or any specific datasets used for training or validation. The paper states that the training data consists of time series of length \( T = 1.6 \times 10^5 \delta t \) and another time series of length \( T = 2 \times 10^3 \delta t \) for validation, but it does not provide specific dataset names or citations.

Since the paper does not reference any publicly available datasets or provide full citations for datasets, I will note that the data used in the experiments is generated from the equations themselves rather than sourced from external datasets.

Now, I will compile the findings:

1. **Mackey-Glass Equation**: The paper describes the generation of noisy observations based on the Mackey-Glass equation, but it does not provide a dataset citation since the data is synthetically generated.

2. **Ikeda Equation**: Similarly, the observations for the Ikeda equation are also generated from the equation itself, and no external dataset citation is provided.

Since there are no external datasets referenced in the paper, I will conclude that the datasets used are not formally cited and are instead derived from the mathematical models discussed.

In summary, while I have identified the equations used to generate the data, there are no formal datasets or citations to provide. This is an important aspect to note when documenting datasets from research papers, as not all studies utilize publicly available datasets or provide citations for generated data.
