To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Taking ROCKET on an Efficiency Mission: Multivariate Time Series Classification with LightWaveS" by Leonardos Pantiskas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, while the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they state that they selected the UEA collection of multivariate datasets and also prepared five machinery-related datasets. This indicates that there are multiple datasets to extract.

The specific datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **UEA Datasets**: The authors refer to the UEA collection of multivariate datasets but do not list them all individually. However, they mention excluding the InsectWingbeat dataset due to size issues. I will need to reference the UEA dataset collection citation.

2. **MAFAULDA Dataset**: This dataset is described as having 8 sensor measurements on a machine fault simulator, taken under normal conditions and five different fault types. The authors provide a citation for this dataset.

3. **TURBOFAN Dataset**: This dataset consists of engine degradation simulation data, containing measurements from 26 sensors. The authors also provide a citation for this dataset.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for these datasets:

- For the **UEA Datasets**, the citation is:
  > A. Bagnall, H. A. Dau, J. Lines, M. Flynn, J. Large, A. Bostrom, P. Southam, and E. Keogh. *The UEA multivariate time series classification archive, 2018*. arXiv:1811.00075 [cs, stat], 2018.

- For the **MAFAULDA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Machinery Fault Database. Available: http://www02.smt.ufrj.br/Ëœoffshore/mfs/page 01.html.

- For the **TURBOFAN Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Saxena and K. Goebel. *Turbofan engine degradation simulation data set*. Available: http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/project/prognostic-data-repository, 2008.

After gathering all the necessary information and citations, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's details, ensuring that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
