To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Fine-Grained Traffic Speed Prediction for Large-Scale Transportation Networks based on Automatic LSTM Customization and Sharing" by Ming-Chang Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention that they conducted experiments based on traffic data collected from **freeway I5-N in California**. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to gather more details.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to the dataset. The authors mention that the traffic data was collected from the **Caltrans performance measurement system**, which is a database of traffic data collected by detectors placed on state highways throughout California. This is crucial information for the dataset citation.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

1. **Traffic Data from Freeway I5-N**: This dataset consists of traffic data collected by 110 detectors deployed on freeway I5-N in California over six continuous working days. The data is aggregated at 5-minute intervals and is split into a training dataset (the first 5 days) and a testing dataset (the last day).

2. **Caltrans Performance Measurement System**: This is the source of the traffic data used in the experiments. It is important to provide a full citation for this source.

Next, I will look for the full citation for the Caltrans performance measurement system in the references section. The relevant citation is:

> PeMS, http://pems.dot.ca.gov/, last accessed 2020/05/31.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its source, I will ensure to format this information correctly for any further processing or documentation.

In summary, I have extracted the following dataset information:
- **Dataset Name**: Traffic Data from Freeway I5-N
- **Description**: Traffic data collected by 110 detectors on freeway I5-N in California over six continuous working days, aggregated at 5-minute intervals.
- **Source Citation**: PeMS, http://pems.dot.ca.gov/, last accessed 2020/05/31.

With this information, I am ready to compile the dataset entries into the required format for further use.
