To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EMFORMER: EFFICIENT MEMORY TRANSFORMER BASED ACOUSTIC MODEL FOR LOW LATENCY STREAMING SPEECH RECOGNITION" by Yangyang Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on the **LibriSpeech data**, which suggests that this dataset is significant for the research.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. In **subsection 3.1 (Data and Setup)**, they explicitly mention using the **LibriSpeech corpus** for their experiments. They provide details about the dataset, stating that it consists of 1000 hours of book reading utterances derived from the LibriVox project, and that it has clean and noisy subsets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the LibriSpeech dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **LibriSpeech**:
  > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *LibriSpeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2015.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered about the LibriSpeech dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry according to the specified format, ensuring that the full citation is included for the LibriSpeech dataset. This will ensure that the dataset is properly documented for future reference or use.
