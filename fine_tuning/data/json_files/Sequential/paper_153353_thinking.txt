To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Abstractive Dialog Summarization with Semantic Scaffolds" by Lin Yuan and Zhou Yu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a dataset based on **MultiWOZ**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will examine the **experimental settings section (Section 4)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention the **MultiWOZ-2.0 dataset**, describing it as consisting of multi-domain conversations for various booking tasks, which is crucial for understanding the context of their work.

In this section, they also provide details about the dataset's structure, including the number of dialogs and the domains covered. This information is vital for accurately describing the dataset.

After identifying the dataset, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the MultiWOZ dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Pawe Budzianowski, Tsung-Hsien Wen, Bo-Hsiang Tseng, Iigo Casanueva, Stefan Ultes, Osman Ramadan, and Milica Gai. *MultiWOZ - A Large-Scale Multi-Domain Wizard-of-Oz Dataset for Task-Oriented Dialogue Modelling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.00278, 2018.

Now that I have the dataset name and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset's details and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and ready for presentation or further processing, maintaining a focus on clarity and completeness in the dataset description.
