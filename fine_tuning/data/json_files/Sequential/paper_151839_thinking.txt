To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring the predictability of range-based volatility estimators using RNNs" by Gábor Petneházi and József Gall, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors analyze volatility estimators using data from the Dow Jones Industrial Average index, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will examine the **data section (Section 5)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used. They mention that they obtained daily open, high, low, and close values for all current constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average index from Yahoo Finance, covering a period from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2017. This section confirms the dataset's existence and provides specifics about its content and source.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset. Since the dataset is derived from Yahoo Finance, I will note that the citation for this dataset is not a traditional academic reference but rather a web source. Therefore, I will format it appropriately:

- **Dataset**: Dow Jones Industrial Average constituents' daily stock prices (open, high, low, close)
  - **Citation**: Yahoo Finance. *Yahoo Finance: Dow Jones Industrial Average*. Available at: https://finance.yahoo.com/

Since the dataset is based on publicly available financial data, I will ensure to mention that it includes historical stock prices for the constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average index.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. This will allow for easy reference and verification in future work or analyses.
