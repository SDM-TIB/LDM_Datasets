To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Emotional Analysis of False Information in Social Media and News Articles" by Bilal Ghanem et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on analyzing false information types, which suggests that datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation Framework)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their analysis. In this section, they describe two main datasets:

1. **News Articles Dataset**: This dataset is built from two sources: trusted news articles sampled from the English Gigaword corpus and false news articles collected from seven unreliable news sites. The dataset includes various types of false information, such as satires, hoaxes, and propagandas, totaling 31,550 articles.

2. **Twitter Dataset**: This dataset consists of tweets collected from suspicious Twitter accounts, with a total of 152,026 tweets. The authors mention that they used a list of annotated suspicious accounts to gather tweets, ensuring a diverse representation of false information types.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they utilized both the News Articles Dataset and the Twitter Dataset for their analysis, which reinforces their importance in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

- For the **News Articles Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hannah Rashkin, Eunsol Choi, Jin Yea Jang, Svitlana Volkova, and Yejin Choi. *Truth of Varying Shades: Analyzing Language in Fake News and Political Fact-Checking*. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2931–2937, 2017.

- For the **Twitter Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Svitlana Volkova, Kyle Shaffer, Jin Yea Jang, and Nathan Hodas. *Separating facts from fiction: Linguistic models to classify suspicious and trusted news posts on twitter*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers), pages 647–653, 2017.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
