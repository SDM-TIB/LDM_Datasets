To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Hybrid Transformer-Sequencer approach for Age and Gender classification from in-wild facial images" by Aakash Singh & Vivek Kumar Singh, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but the **dataset section** is likely where the authors will detail the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of facial analysis and mention that several benchmark datasets have been used in this domain. This indicates that there are datasets relevant to their research, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly mention the **Adience face dataset**. They describe it as a popular dataset with 19,370 images labeled by age and gender, which is crucial for their study. The details provided include the age groups and gender labels, confirming its relevance.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Adience dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Eidinger, E., Enbar, R., & Hassner, T. (2014). Age and gender estimation of unfiltered faces. *IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security*, 9(12), 2170-2179.

Since the paper mentions only the Adience dataset, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is critical for proper referencing.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Adience dataset, ensuring that it is ready for review or further processing.
