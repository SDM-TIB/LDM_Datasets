To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AGAN: Towards Automated Design of Generative Adversarial Networks" by Hanchao Wang and Jun Huan, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets, which indicates that these datasets are likely to be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will navigate to **section 4.1 (Data Sets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find the following details:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The paper states that this dataset consists of 60,000 32 × 32 color images across 10 different classes, with a training set of 50,000 images and a testing set of 10,000 images. This dataset is used exclusively for training in their experiments.

2. **STL-10 Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as containing 96 × 96 color images, also across 10 different classes, with 500 training images and 800 testing images per class, plus an additional 100,000 unlabeled images for unsupervised learning.

After identifying the datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations I need to locate are:

- For the **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For the **STL-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Adam Coates, Andrew Y. Ng, and Honglak Lee. *An Analysis of Single-Layer Networks in Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS), 2011.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
