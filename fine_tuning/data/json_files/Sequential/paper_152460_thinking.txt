To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Story Understanding in Video Advertisements" by Keren Ye, Kyle Buettner, and Adriana Kovashka, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors crowdsource climax annotations on **1,149 videos from the Video Ads Dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **methodology section**. In section 3.1, the authors describe the **Video Ads Dataset**, stating that it contains **3,477 video advertisements** with various annotations, including sentiment annotations. They also mention that they collected climax annotations on a subset of **1,595 videos**, ultimately resulting in **1,149 videos** with climax annotations.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Video Ads Dataset. The authors cite the dataset as follows:

- For the **Video Ads Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zaeem Hussain, Mingda Zhang, Xiaozhong Zhang, Keren Ye, Christopher Thomas, Zuha Agha, Nathan Ong, and Adriana Kovashka. *Automatic understanding of image and video advertisements*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1100â€“1110, 2017.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Video Ads Dataset**: This dataset contains **3,477 video advertisements** with various annotations, including sentiment and climax annotations. The authors specifically used a subset of **1,149 videos** for their climax annotation study.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
