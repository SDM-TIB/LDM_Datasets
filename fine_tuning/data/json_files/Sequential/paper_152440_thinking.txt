To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Neuron Non-Linearities with Kernel-Based Deep Neural Networks" by Giuseppe Marra et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on the introduction and experiments for specific dataset references.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of activation functions in deep learning but do not mention any datasets directly. Therefore, I will proceed to the **experiments section**.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe several experiments, including the XOR problem and the charging problem. They mention using a "set of benchmarks inspired by seminal papers" but do not provide specific dataset names or citations. I will look for any references to datasets used in these experiments.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited there. The references include various papers, but I need to determine if any of these papers correspond to datasets used in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite several foundational papers related to activation functions and recurrent networks, but they do not provide specific datasets. This indicates that the experiments may have been conducted using synthetic data or benchmarks that are not formally named datasets.

Since no specific datasets are mentioned in the paper, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract with full citations. However, I will note that the experiments rely on established benchmarks and synthetic data, which may be referenced in the cited works.

In summary, I will document that the paper does not provide explicit datasets but relies on benchmarks and synthetic data for its experiments. I will also note the relevant references that could be consulted for further information on the benchmarks used.
