To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Investigation of the Relation Between Grapheme Embeddings and Pronunciation for Tacotron-based Systems" by Antoine Perquin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of Tacotron models for text-to-speech synthesis but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **methodology section** where the authors describe the architecture of their Tacotron-based model.

In **section 2 (Tacotron-based Model Architecture)**, the authors mention using the **SIWIS dataset** for training their models. They describe this dataset as containing high-quality speech recordings of a French female professional voice actress reading sentences from parliamentary sessions and French books. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** to confirm the use of the SIWIS dataset. In **section 3 (Experiments)**, the authors conduct listening tests and objective evaluations, but they continue to reference the SIWIS dataset as the source of their training data. This reinforces that the SIWIS dataset is indeed the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the SIWIS dataset. The authors cite the dataset as follows:
> P.-E. Honnet, A. Lazaridis, P. N. Garner, and J. Yamagishi. "The SIWIS French speech synthesis database â€“ design and recording of a high quality French database for speech synthesis." Idiap, Tech. Rep., 2017.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset details:

1. **SIWIS Dataset**: A high-quality speech synthesis dataset containing recordings of a French female voice actress reading sentences from parliamentary sessions and French books. The dataset is designed to cover a wide range of phoneme occurrences and includes around 9 hours of speech.

Now I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset information and its citation as required.
