To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-local NetVLAD Encoding for Video Classification" by Yongyi Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention their participation in the **2nd YouTube-8M video understanding challenge**, which indicates that the YouTube-8M dataset is likely a key dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors reference several video datasets, including **UCF-101**, **HMDB-51**, **ActivityNet**, and notably, the **YouTube-8M dataset**. This suggests that these datasets may be relevant to their work.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will focus on **section 3.1**, where the authors explicitly discuss the **YouTube-8M dataset**. They describe it as containing about **6.1 million videos**, with **3862 class labels** and an average of **3 labels per video**. This section confirms that the YouTube-8M dataset is indeed utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citation for the YouTube-8M dataset is:

- **YouTube-8M Dataset**:
  > Abu-El-Haija, S., Kothari, N., Lee, J., Natsev, P., Toderici, G., Varadarajan, B., Vijayanarasimhan, S. (2016). *Youtube-8m: A large-scale video classification benchmark*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.08675.

The other datasets mentioned (UCF-101, HMDB-51, ActivityNet) are not detailed in the paper, so I will look up their citations separately:

- **UCF-101 Dataset**:
  > Soomro, K., Zamir, A.R., Shah, M. (2012). *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402.

- **HMDB-51 Dataset**:
  > Jhuang, H., Garrote, H., Poggio, E., Serre, T. (2011). *A large video database for human motion recognition*. In Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision.

- **ActivityNet Dataset**:
  > Caba Heilbron, F., Escorcia, V., Ghanem, B., Carlos Niebles, J. (2015). *Activitynet: A large-scale video benchmark for human activity understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, which is crucial for proper attribution in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
