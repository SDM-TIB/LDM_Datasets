To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HyperAdam: A Learnable Task-Adaptive Adam for Network Training" by Shipeng Wang, Jian Sun, and Zongben Xu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or evaluation sections**. In this paper, the authors discuss the use of various datasets for training and evaluating their proposed optimizer, HyperAdam. 

In the **evaluation section**, the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset** for training a learner (a forward neural network) and also refer to the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for evaluating generalization. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, 2009.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are complete and ready for any further processing or review.
