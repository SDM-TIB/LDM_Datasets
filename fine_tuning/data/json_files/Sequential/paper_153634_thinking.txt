To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Audio-Visual Decision Fusion for WFST-Based and Seq2Seq Models" by Rohith Aralikatti et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of audio and visual modalities for speech recognition, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction provides context about audio-visual speech recognition but does not name any datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **datasets section (Section 2)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they refer to two datasets:

1. **GRID audio-visual corpus**: This dataset is referenced as a well-known corpus for audio-visual speech recognition, which is commonly used in the field.

2. **Bixby dataset**: This dataset is described in detail, indicating that it was collected from 773 American speakers and consists of commands spoken to Samsung's Bixby voice assistant. The section provides specifics about the number of speakers, utterances per speaker, and vocabulary size.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The GRID audio-visual corpus is cited as follows:

- For the GRID audio-visual corpus:
  > Cooke, Martin, et al. "An audio-visual corpus for speech perception and automatic speech recognition." *The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America* 120.5 (2006): 2421-2424.

The Bixby dataset is a private dataset created by the authors, so it does not have a formal citation in the references. However, I will note the details provided in the paper for completeness.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the full citation for the GRID dataset and a description for the Bixby dataset.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
