To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving AMR Parsing with Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training" by Dongqin Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimentation sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **two English benchmark datasets**, which indicates that datasets are present in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimentation section** (Section 4), where the authors discuss their experimental settings. Here, they mention using **AMR 1.0** and **AMR 2.0** datasets for evaluating their AMR parsing performance. This is a clear indication of the datasets used.

In **Section 4.1**, the authors provide details about the AMR datasets:
1. **AMR 1.0**: This dataset contains 16,833 training AMRs.
2. **AMR 2.0**: This dataset contains 36,521 training AMRs.

Both datasets share 1,368 development AMRs and 1,371 testing AMRs. This information confirms the datasets utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the AMR datasets are as follows:

- For **AMR 1.0**, the citation is:
  > Banarescu, L., Bonial, C., Cai, S., Georgescu, M., Grifﬁtt, K., Hermjakob, U., Knight, K., Koehn, P., Palmer, M., & Schneider, N. (2013). Abstract meaning representation for sembanking. In Proceedings of the 7th Linguistic Annotation Workshop and Interoperability with Discourse, pages 178–186.

- For **AMR 2.0**, the citation is:
  > Banarescu, L., Bonial, C., Cai, S., Georgescu, M., Grifﬁtt, K., Hermjakob, U., Knight, K., Koehn, P., Palmer, M., & Schneider, N. (2013). Abstract meaning representation for sembanking. In Proceedings of the 7th Linguistic Annotation Workshop and Interoperability with Discourse, pages 178–186. (Note: The citation is the same as AMR 1.0, as both datasets are part of the same project.)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
