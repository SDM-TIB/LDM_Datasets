To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SIP: Injecting a Structural Inductive Bias into a Seq2Seq Model by Simulation" by Matthias Lindemann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look specifically for sections that detail the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, I will focus on **section 4 (Simulation-Induced Prior)** and **section 5 (Evaluating SIP’s Inductive Bias)**, as these sections typically contain information about the datasets used for training and evaluation.

In **section 4.3 (Constructing Pre-Training Data)**, the authors describe how they generated synthetic datasets for their experiments. They mention that they sampled **40,000 deterministic Finite State Transducers (FSTs)** and created **200,000 input/output pairs** for training. This indicates that the dataset is synthetic and generated specifically for their research.

In **section 6 (Transfer to Natural Data)**, the authors discuss their evaluation on **grapheme-to-phoneme conversion tasks** using data from **Wikipron**. They mention that they focused on low-resource languages and provide a list of languages used in their experiments.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Synthetic FSTs Dataset**: The dataset is generated by the authors and does not have a formal citation since it is synthetic. However, I will note that it consists of 40,000 deterministic FSTs and 200,000 input/output pairs.

2. **Wikipron Dataset**: The citation for the dataset used for grapheme-to-phoneme conversion is:
   > Lee, J. L., Ashby, L. F. E., Garza, M. E., Lee-Sikka, Y., Miller, S., Wong, A., McCarthy, A. D., & Gorman, K. (2020). Massively multilingual pronunciation modeling with WikiPron. In Proceedings of the Twelfth Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC 2020), pages 4223–4228, Marseille, France. European Language Resources Association.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
