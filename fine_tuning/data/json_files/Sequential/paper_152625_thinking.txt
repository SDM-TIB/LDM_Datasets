To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Feature Trajectory Dynamic Time Warping for Clustering of Speech Segments" by Lerato Lerato and Thomas Niesler, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted using data from the **TIMIT** and **Spoken Arabic Digit Dataset (SADD)**, which suggests that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Data)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for experimentation. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **TIMIT Speech Corpus**: This dataset consists of 8772 triphone segments that are evenly balanced. It is noted for its accurate time-aligned phonetic transcriptions, which are crucial for the experiments conducted.

2. **Spoken Arabic Digit Dataset (SADD)**: This dataset includes 8800 utterances of isolated Arabic digits, which are already parametrized as 13-dimensional MFCCs. The utterances were spoken by 44 male and 44 female Arabic speakers.

3. **TIMIT SI and SX Triphones**: This dataset comprises 123,182 triphone segments drawn from the TIMIT corpus, divided randomly into 10 subsets. This dataset is noted for not being evenly balanced.

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **TIMIT Speech Corpus**, the citation is:
  > John S Garofolo, Lori F Lamel, William M Fisher, Jonathon G Fiscus, David S Pallett, Nancy Dahlgren, and Victor Zue. *DARPA TIMIT acoustic-phonetic continuous speech corpus LDC93S1*. 1993.

- For the **Spoken Arabic Digit Dataset (SADD)**, the citation is:
  > M. Lichman. *UCI machine learning repository*. 2013.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be described with its name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and reference.
