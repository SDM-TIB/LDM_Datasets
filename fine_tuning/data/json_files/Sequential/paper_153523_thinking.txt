To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Attribute Oriented Induction based Methodology for Data Driven Predictive Maintenance" by Javier Fernandez-Anakabe et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that the dataset was provided by the Prognostics CoE at NASA Ames and consists of multiple simulations of wear in a turbine engine. They specify that there are two groups of data: training data with 100 simulations and test data with another 100 simulations. This section is crucial as it contains detailed information about the dataset's structure and attributes.

In this section, the authors also clarify that the dataset includes 24 attributes, of which 3 are related to Operational Settings and the rest are sensor measurements. They further explain that only 21 attributes were used for analysis after eliminating those that did not vary over time.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- For the dataset from NASA Ames, the citation is:
  > Prognostics CoE at NASA Ames. *Turbofan wear open dataset*. URL: https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Turbofan wear dataset
   - **Description**: The dataset consists of multiple simulations of wear in a turbine engine, including training and test data with various attributes related to operational settings and sensor measurements.
   - **Full Citation**: Prognostics CoE at NASA Ames. *Turbofan wear open dataset*. URL: https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/

After gathering all necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
