To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DAM: A Universal Dual Attention Mechanism for Multimodal Timeseries Cryptocurrency Trend Forecasting" by Yihang Fu, Mingyu Zhou, and Luyao Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction discusses the context and motivation for the research, which might hint at the data sources used.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the **Data Acquisition** subsection, where the authors describe their data sources in detail. Here, they mention that they sourced Bitcoin data via the **CryptoCompare API**, extracted Bitcoin news sentiment from **Nasdaq**, and collected social media data from a public **Kaggle dataset**. This is crucial information as it directly identifies the datasets used in their research.

I will also check the **appendices** and **tables** for any additional details about the datasets. For instance, Table I describes the Nasdaq data, and Table II provides descriptors for the processed dataset, which includes various financial indicators.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Bitcoin Data from CryptoCompare API**: The paper does not provide a specific citation for the API, but I can note that it is publicly accessible via the link provided in the methodology section.
   - Citation: CryptoCompare API. Available at: https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/

2. **Nasdaq Sentiment Data**: The authors mention that the sentiment data was queried from Nasdaq, but they do not provide a specific citation for the dataset. However, they reference the documentation for the Nasdaq data.
   - Citation: Nasdaq Data. Available at: https://data.nasdaq.com/databases/BICRS/documentation

3. **Kaggle Social Media Dataset**: The authors refer to a public Kaggle dataset for social media data. They provide a link to the dataset in the methodology section.
   - Citation: Kaushik Suresh. *Bitcoin Tweets Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushiksuresh147/bitcoin-tweets

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations. This will allow me to create a structured output that reflects the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
