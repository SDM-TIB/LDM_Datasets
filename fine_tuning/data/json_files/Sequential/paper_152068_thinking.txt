To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Neural Transducers for End-to-End Speech Recognition" by Eric Battenberg et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions an empirical comparison among different models for speech recognition and references the **Hub5’00 benchmark** and an **internal diverse dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are likely important for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the introduction, the authors refer to the **Hub5’00 benchmark**, which is a well-known dataset in the field of speech recognition. I will note this down as a dataset of interest.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide results on the **Hub5’00 benchmark** and also mention the **DeepSpeech corpus**. The DeepSpeech corpus is described as containing about 10,000 hours of speech data in various scenarios, which is significant for understanding the dataset's scope.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **Hub5’00 benchmark**: This dataset is commonly referenced in the literature, and I will look for its citation in the references. The citation typically includes the original source or paper that introduced the dataset.

2. **DeepSpeech corpus**: The authors reference a paper by Dario Amodei et al. that describes the DeepSpeech model, which likely includes details about the dataset. I will find the citation for this paper as well.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations. The citations I expect to find are:

- For the **Hub5’00 benchmark**, the citation is likely:
  > "The Hub5’00 benchmark is part of the NIST Rich Transcription evaluation series, which has been widely used for evaluating automatic speech recognition systems."

- For the **DeepSpeech corpus**, the citation is:
  > Dario Amodei, Rishita Anubhai, Eric Battenberg, et al. *Deep Speech 2: End-to-End Speech Recognition in English and Mandarin*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.02595, 2015.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the names, descriptions, and citations of the datasets, ready for further processing or review.
