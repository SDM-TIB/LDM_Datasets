To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Non-I.I.D. and Invisible Data with FedNAS: Federated Deep Learning via Neural Architecture Search" by Chaoyang He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of federated learning and hints at the use of a non-IID dataset, which suggests that a specific dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly mention using the **CIFAR10 dataset** for their image classification task. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its composition of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes.

In the **experimental setup subsection**, the authors explain how they generated a non-IID dataset from CIFAR10 by splitting the training images into clients in an unbalanced manner. This is crucial information as it describes how the dataset was utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR10 dataset. The CIFAR10 dataset is a well-known dataset, and its citation is typically available in the literature. The standard citation for CIFAR10 is:

- For **CIFAR10 Dataset**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and citations in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citation for CIFAR10 as it is essential for proper attribution.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a clear format for further processing or review, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
