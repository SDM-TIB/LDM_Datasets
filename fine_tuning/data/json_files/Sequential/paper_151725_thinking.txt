To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-Grained Age Estimation in the Wild with Attention LSTM Networks" by Ke Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of several datasets for age estimation, which indicates that there are specific datasets to look for.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of age estimation and the importance of using various datasets. This section may provide context for the datasets used but may not list them explicitly.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection labeled **Datasets**. Here, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets they utilized for their experiments. I will look for specific names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics about each dataset.

The paper mentions the following datasets:

1. **IMDB-WIKI-101 Dataset**: This dataset is described as the largest publicly available dataset for age estimation, containing over 0.5 million images with accurate age labels. It is used for pretraining the models.

2. **Adience Dataset**: This dataset consists of 26,580 color facial images of 2,284 subjects, categorized into eight age groups. It is used for age group classification.

3. **MORPH Album 2**: This dataset includes 55,134 face images with ages ranging from 16 to 77. It is one of the largest publicly available age datasets and is used for age regression tasks.

4. **FG-NET Dataset**: This smaller dataset contains 1,002 images of 82 individuals, ranging from 0 to 69 years old. It is used for evaluating age estimation methods.

5. **15/16LAP Datasets**: These datasets are used for apparent age estimation and consist of images taken under unconstrained conditions. They include age labels based on the average of annotators' subjective opinions.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further reference.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
