To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Forecasting Economic and Financial Time Series: ARIMA vs. LSTM" by Sima Siami Namin and Akbar Siami Namin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and the datasets section** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the study but may not specify datasets. The introduction discusses the comparison of ARIMA and LSTM models but does not detail datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Data Sets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention that they extracted historical monthly financial time series data from Yahoo Finance, which includes several indices. They also mention collecting economic time series data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Nikkei 225 index (N225)**: Historical monthly data from January 1985 to August 2018.
2. **NASDAQ composite index (IXIC)**: Historical monthly data from January 1985 to August 2018.
3. **Hang Seng Index (HIS)**: Historical monthly data from January 1985 to August 2018.
4. **S&P 500 commodity price index (GSPC)**: Historical monthly data from January 1985 to August 2018.
5. **Dow Jones industrial average index (DJ)**: Historical monthly data from January 1985 to August 2018.
6. **Medical care commodities for all urban consumers (MC)**: Monthly data from January 1967 to July 2017.
7. **Housing for all urban consumers (HO)**: Monthly data from January 1967 to July 2017.
8. **Trade-weighted U.S. dollar index (EX)**: Monthly data from August 1967 to July 2017.
9. **Food and Beverages for all urban consumers (FB)**: Monthly data from January 1967 to July 2017.
10. **M1 Money Stock (MS)**: Monthly data from January 1959 to July 2017.
11. **Transportation for all urban consumers (TR)**: Monthly data from January 1947 to July 2017.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. However, the datasets themselves are derived from publicly available sources (Yahoo Finance, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, IMF), so I will note that these sources are the citations for the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Yahoo Finance data**:
  > Yahoo Finance. Business Finance, Stock Market, Quotes, News. Available at: https://finance.yahoo.com/

- For the **Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data**:
  > Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Available at: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/

- For the **International Monetary Fund data**:
  > International Monetary Fund. Available at: http://www.imf.org/external/index.htm

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations. Each dataset will be described with its name, a brief description, and the citation source.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing.
