To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Making Good on LSTMsâ€™ Unfulfilled Promise" by Daniel Philps et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on financial time-series analysis and mentions the use of a complex real-world problem, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experimental setup section**. This section typically details the data used for experiments, including any datasets that were utilized for training or testing the models. I will pay close attention to any descriptions of the data characteristics, such as the number of samples, features, and the context in which the data was collected.

In the **results section**, I will check for any references to the performance of the models on specific datasets, as this may provide additional context or confirm the datasets used in the experiments.

Once I identify the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary attribution and allows others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Emerging Market Equities Index," I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail. I will ensure to note down the authors, title, publication venue, and any relevant details such as the year of publication.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further, ensuring that all citations are accurate and complete.
