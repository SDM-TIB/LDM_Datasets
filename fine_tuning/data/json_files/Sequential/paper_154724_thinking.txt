To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Perspective LSTM for Joint Visual Representation Learning" by Alireza Sepas-Moghaddam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their architecture using three relevant datasets for lip reading and face recognition tasks. This suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, particularly **subsection 4.3 (Datasets and Test Protocols)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **OuluVS2 Dataset**: This dataset consists of videos of 52 speakers uttering the same phrases and digit sequences, recorded from five different angles. The authors follow a specific test protocol for evaluation.

2. **LF Faces in the Wild (LFFW)**: This dataset includes 1908 light field face images captured from 53 subjects under various conditions, providing a rich set of data for face recognition tasks.

3. **LF Face Constrained (LFFC)**: This dataset contains 1060 light field images of the same subjects as LFFW but captured in a controlled environment, allowing for a comparative analysis between the two datasets.

I will then verify the details of these datasets by checking the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **OuluVS2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > I. Anina, Z. Zhou, G. Zhao, and M. Pietikäinen. *OuluVS2: A multi-view audiovisual database for non-rigid mouth motion analysis*. In Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition, pages 1–5, 2015.

- For the **LFFW Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Sepas-Moghaddam, A. Etemad, F. Pereira, and P. Correia. *Capsfield: Light field-based face and expression recognition in the wild using capsule routing*. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 30(1):2627–2642, 2021.

- For the **LFFC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Sepas-Moghaddam, A. Etemad, F. Pereira, and P. Correia. *Long short-term memory with gate and state level fusion for light field-based face recognition*. IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, 16(1):1365–1379, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
