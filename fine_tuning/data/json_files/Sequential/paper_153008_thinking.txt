To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Cell Structure via Recursive-Recurrent Neural Networks" by Xin Qian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **three common datasets**, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will look for specific names and details about the datasets. The authors mention using the following datasets:

1. **Wikipedia Dataset**: This dataset is used for predicting the next character in text drawn from the Hutter prize Wikipedia dataset. The authors specify that they removed all numbers, punctuation, XML tags, and markup characters, leaving only 26 English characters and space.

2. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis, involving classifying one-sentence movie reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. The authors state that they used the full training set of 8,544 samples, along with a randomly chosen 1,000 samples for validation and 2,000 for testing.

3. **Penn Treebank (PTB)**: This dataset is used for word-level language modeling. The authors mention that they randomly selected a 10,000 sample subset of 20 words each, along with 1,000 samples for validation and 2,000 for testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Wikipedia Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marcus Hutter. *Universal artificial intelligence: Sequential decisions based on algorithmic probability*. Springer Science & Business Media, 2004.

- For the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**, the citation is:
  > Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D. Manning, Andrew Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1631â€“1642. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2013.

- For the **Penn Treebank (PTB)**, the citation is:
  > Mitchell Marcus, Beatrice Santorini, and Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. 1993.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will prepare to compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.
