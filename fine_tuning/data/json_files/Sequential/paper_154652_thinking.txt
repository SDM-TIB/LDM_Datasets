To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Q-matrix Unaware Double JPEG Detection using DCT-Domain Deep BiLSTM Network" by Vinay Verma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a "relatively large and diverse publicly available dataset of single and double compressed patches," which indicates that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In this section, they mention that the dataset consists of "1,140,430 single and double compressed JPEG patches of size 256 × 256 generated from 18,946 uncompressed images with 1120 unique Q-matrices." This gives me a clear understanding of the dataset's size and composition.

I will also look for any specific references to the datasets in the **references section** to ensure I can provide full citations. The authors refer to the dataset as being derived from several uncompressed datasets captured with various cameras, specifically mentioning three datasets: **RAISE**, **Dresden**, and **BOSSBase**.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets:

1. **Publicly Available Dataset**: This dataset is derived from uncompressed images and contains 1,140,430 single and double compressed JPEG patches. The dataset is significant for benchmarking methods in JPEG compression detection.

2. **RAISE Dataset**: This dataset consists of raw images used to generate the compressed patches. It includes a variety of images captured by different camera models.

3. **Dresden Dataset**: This dataset is used for benchmarking digital image forensics and includes various images that can be utilized for testing the proposed methods.

   Citation:

4. **BOSSBase Dataset**: This dataset contains uncompressed grayscale images that are also used in the experiments.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the details of each dataset, including their significance and the full citations. This will allow me to create a structured output that can be used for further analysis or reference.
