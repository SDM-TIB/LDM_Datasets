To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Recurrent Architectures Through Activity Sparsity and Sparse Back-Propagation Through Time" by Anand Subramoney et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their model on several tasks, including gesture recognition, sequential MNIST, and language modeling. I will look for specific dataset names associated with these tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors provide details about their experiments, including references to datasets. For example, they mention the **DVS128 Gesture Dataset** for gesture recognition, the **Sequential MNIST** dataset for the MNIST task, and the **Penn Treebank** and **WikiText-2** datasets for language modeling.

Now, I will compile the details of each dataset:

1. **DVS128 Gesture Dataset**: This dataset is used for gesture recognition and contains event-based inputs from a DVS128 event camera. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Amir, A., Taba, B., Berg, D., Melano, T., McKinstry, J., DiNolfo, C., Nayak, T., Andreopoulos, A., Garreau, G., Mendoza, M., et al. (2017). A low power, fully event-based gesture recognition system. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 7243–7252.

2. **Sequential MNIST**: This dataset is based on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset, where the digits are presented one pixel at a time. The original MNIST dataset citation is:
   > LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., & Haffner, P. (1998). Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11), 2278–2324.

3. **Penn Treebank**: This dataset is used for language modeling and is a well-known corpus for natural language processing tasks. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Marcus, M. P., Marcinkiewicz, M. A., & Santorini, B. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. Computational Linguistics, 19(2), 313–330.

4. **WikiText-2**: This dataset is another language modeling dataset that is derived from Wikipedia articles. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Merity, S., Keskar, N. S., & Socher, R. (2017). Regularizing and optimizing LSTM language models. In International Conference on Learning Representations.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately noted the details and citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will allow me to create a comprehensive summary of the datasets used in the research.
