To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ReMixMatch: Semi-Supervised Learning with Distribution Alignment and Augmentation Anchoring" by David Berthelot et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the ReMixMatch algorithm on various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors mention that they validate their method on standard semi-supervised learning benchmarks, specifically **CIFAR-10** and **SVHN**. They also mention **STL-10** as another dataset used for evaluation.

I will then look for any additional details about these datasets in the text. For example, the authors provide specific results for CIFAR-10 and SVHN, indicating that they used these datasets for their experiments. They also mention the number of labeled examples used in their evaluations, which is relevant for understanding the context of the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

1. **CIFAR-10**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset of images*. 2009. [Link to dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

2. **SVHN**:
   > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2011. [Link to dataset](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/)

3. **STL-10**:
   > Adam Coates, Andrew Y. Ng, and Honglak Lee. *An Analysis of Single-Layer Networks in Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS), 2011. [Link to dataset](https://cs.stanford.edu/~acoates/stl10/)

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
