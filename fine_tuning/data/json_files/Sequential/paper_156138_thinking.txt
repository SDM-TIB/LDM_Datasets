To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detection of Sensor-To-Sensor Variations Using Explainable AI" by Sarah Seifi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of artificial and realistic Ozone concentration profiles for training a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model, indicating that these profiles are likely datasets of interest.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the datasets. The introduction mentions the importance of retrieving data from similar sensors for model training and highlights the use of Ozone concentration profiles, which suggests that these profiles are significant datasets.

In the **Methodology and Experiments** section, I will look for specific mentions of datasets. The authors describe the sensor setup and the measurement and data setup, indicating that they used both artificial and realistic Ozone concentration profiles. The realistic profiles are sourced from the **TOAR Database**, which is explicitly mentioned as a dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **Results and Discussion** section to confirm the datasets used and their applications in the experiments. The authors discuss the performance of their model using both artificial and realistic datasets, reinforcing the importance of these datasets in their analysis.

Finally, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

1. For the **TOAR Database**, the citation is:
   > S. Schröder et al., “TOAR Data Infrastructure.” https://b2share.fz-juelich.de/records/4d9a287dec0b42f1aa6d244de8f19eb3 (accessed Jan. 17, 2023).

2. The artificial Ozone concentration profiles do not have a specific citation provided in the paper, as they are described as being designed for the study.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets identified. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
