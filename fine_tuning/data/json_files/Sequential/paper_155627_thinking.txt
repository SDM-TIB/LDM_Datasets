To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Focus-Driven Contrastive Learning for Medical Question Summarization" by Ming Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **three medical benchmark datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention:

1. **MeqSum**: This dataset is constructed by Ben Abacha and Demner-Fushman (2019) and is described as a high-quality dataset from NIH. It is used for summarizing consumer health questions.

2. **HealthCareMagic**: This dataset is extracted from MedDialog (Zeng et al., 2020) and is collected from an online healthcare service platform. It contains a large number of consumer health questions.

3. **iCliniq**: Also extracted from MedDialog (Zeng et al., 2020), this dataset consists of patient-written questions and is used for the same summarization task.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide statistics for each dataset, including the number of training, validation, and test samples, which further confirms their relevance and usage in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to obtain the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MeqSum**, the citation is:
  > Ben Abacha, A., & Demner-Fushman, D. (2019). On the summarization of consumer health questions. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (pp. 2228–2234). Florence, Italy: Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **HealthCareMagic** and **iCliniq**, both datasets are cited from the same source:
  > Zeng, G., Yang, W., Ju, Z., Yang, Y., Wang, S., Zhang, R., ... & Xie, P. (2020). MedDialog: Large-scale medical dialogue datasets. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) (pp. 9241–9250). Online: Association for Computational Linguistics.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **MeqSum**: A high-quality dataset for summarizing consumer health questions, constructed by Ben Abacha and Demner-Fushman (2019).
2. **HealthCareMagic**: A dataset extracted from MedDialog, containing consumer health questions from an online healthcare service platform.
3. **iCliniq**: Another dataset from MedDialog, consisting of patient-written questions.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations for clarity and completeness.
