To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "DoLFIn: Distributions over Latent Features for Interpretability" by Phong Le and Willem Zuidema, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their method to text classification, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **TREC Question**: This dataset is used for classifying questions into six categories: ABBR, DECS, ENTY, HUM, LOC, and NUM. The authors provide a brief description of the dataset, including the average length of questions and the number of training, development, and test samples.

2. **SST2**: This dataset is for predicting the binary sentiment of movie reviews (positive/negative). The authors note that the training set contains labeled phrases and sentences, which is a key detail.

3. **AG-news**: This dataset is for news topic classification with four topics: WORLD, SPORTS, BUSINESS, and SCI-TECH. The authors highlight that AG-news is the largest dataset among the three in terms of the number of texts and average length.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **TREC Question**, the citation is:
  > Li, X., & Roth, D. (2002). Learning question classifiers. In COLING 2002: The 19th International Conference on Computational Linguistics.

- For **SST2**, the citation is:
  > Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J., Chuang, J., Manning, C. D., Ng, A., & Potts, C. (2013). Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing.

- For **AG-news**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, X., Zhao, J., & LeCun, Y. (2015). Character-level convolutional networks for text classification. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, which is crucial for proper attribution in any subsequent analysis or application.
