To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SHAQ: Single Headed Attention with Quasi-Recurrence" by Nashwin Bharwani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors discuss the ENWIK8 dataset in detail, which is crucial for their experiments. I will extract relevant details about this dataset, including its purpose, composition, and any preprocessing steps mentioned.

In the **section 1.2 (ENWIK8 Dataset)**, the authors describe the dataset as being derived from an XML dump of the English version of Wikipedia, consisting of 100M UTF-encoded bytes. They also mention how the dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets, which is important for understanding its structure.

After gathering information about the dataset, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the ENWIK8 dataset. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the dataset. The relevant citation for the ENWIK8 dataset is:

> Marcus Hutter. *The Hutter Prize for Lossless Compression of Human Knowledge*. 2011.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings in a clear and concise manner, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and completeness.
