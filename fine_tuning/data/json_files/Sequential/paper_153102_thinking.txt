To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing the Locality and Breaking the Memory Bottleneck of Transformer on Time Series Forecasting" by Shiyang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions experiments on both synthetic data and real-world datasets, which indicates that there are multiple datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. In this section, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics.

Upon reviewing section 5.2 (Real-world datasets), I find the following datasets explicitly mentioned:

1. **Electricity-f (fine)**: This dataset consists of electricity consumption data from 370 customers recorded every 15 minutes.
2. **Electricity-c (coarse)**: This dataset is the aggregated version of electricity-f, producing hourly electricity consumption.
3. **Traffic-f (fine)**: This dataset contains occupancy rates of 963 freeway lanes in the San Francisco Bay Area recorded every 20 minutes.
4. **Traffic-c (coarse)**: This dataset is the hourly aggregated version of traffic-f.
5. **Solar dataset**: This dataset includes solar power production records from 137 PV plants in Alabama, sampled every hour from January to August 2006.
6. **Wind dataset**: This dataset contains daily estimates of energy potential from 28 countries from 1986 to 2015.
7. **M4-Hourly**: This dataset consists of 414 hourly time series from the M4 competition.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper may not provide specific citations for all datasets, especially if they are well-known datasets in the field. However, I will document the citations for those that are mentioned.

For the datasets that are not explicitly cited in the references, I will note that they are commonly used datasets in time series forecasting and may not have a specific citation in this paper.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation where applicable.

1. **Electricity-f (fine)**:
   - Description: Electricity consumption data from 370 customers recorded every 15 minutes.
   - Citation: Not explicitly cited in the paper.

2. **Electricity-c (coarse)**:

   - Citation: Not explicitly cited in the paper.

3. **Traffic-f (fine)**:
   - Description: Occupancy rates of 963 freeway lanes in the San Francisco Bay Area recorded every 20 minutes.
   - Citation: Not explicitly cited in the paper.

4. **Traffic-c (coarse)**:
   - Description: Hourly aggregated version of traffic-f.
   - Citation: Not explicitly cited in the paper.

5. **Solar dataset**:
   - Description: Solar power production records from 137 PV plants in Alabama, sampled every hour from January to August 2006.
   - Citation: National Renewable Energy Laboratory. *Solar Power Data*. Available at: https://www.nrel.gov/grid/solar-power-data.html.

6. **Wind dataset**:
   - Description: Daily estimates of energy potential from 28 countries from 1986 to 2015.
   - Citation: Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/sohier/30-years-of-european-wind-generation.

7. **M4-Hourly**:
   - Description: 414 hourly time series from the M4 competition.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that it is presented clearly and accurately, ready for any further processing or review.
