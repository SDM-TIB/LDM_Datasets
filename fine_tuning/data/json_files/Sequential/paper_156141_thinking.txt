To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Constructing Colloquial Dataset for Persian Sentiment Analysis of Social Microblogs" by Mojtaba Mazoochi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a user opinion dataset called **ITRC-Opinion**, which is a strong lead for the dataset I need to document.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Persian sentiment dataset construction)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they describe the **ITRC-Opinion** dataset, which consists of 60,000 informal and colloquial Persian texts collected from social microblogs like Twitter and Instagram. This section outlines the dataset's construction process, including the crawling of data and the annotation by native Persian speakers.

I will also check the **results** and **conclusion** sections to confirm the dataset's significance and its application in the experiments. The authors emphasize the dataset's role in evaluating their proposed deep learning architecture for sentiment analysis, which further validates its importance.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the **ITRC-Opinion** dataset. Since the paper states that the dataset is available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request, I will note that the citation for this dataset may not be formally published in a separate paper but is still crucial to mention.

The citation for the **ITRC-Opinion** dataset is:
> Mazoochi, M., Rabiei, L., Rahmani, F., & Rajabi, Z. (2023). Constructing Colloquial Dataset for Persian Sentiment Analysis of Social Microblogs. *[Journal Name]*, *[Volume]*, *[Page Numbers]*. [DOI or URL if available].

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation in a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will allow for easy access to the dataset details and ensure proper attribution in any subsequent work.
