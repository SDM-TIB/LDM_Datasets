To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Jointly Learning Spatial, Angular, and Temporal Information for Enhanced Lane Detection" by Muhammad Zeshan Alam, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any mention of datasets used for lane detection. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Training)**, where the author discusses the dataset used for training their models. The paper mentions that they employed the **Alam et al. [21] dataset**, which has been expanded to include 3,000 images across 300 sequences. This dataset is crucial for the experiments conducted in the study, as it supports the analysis of temporal, spatial, and angular information for lane detection.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Alam et al. dataset. The citation is as follows:
> M. Z. Alam, S. Kelouwani, J. Boisclair, and A. A. Amamou. "Learning light fields for improved lane detection." *IEEE Access*, vol. 11, pp. 271â€“283, 2023.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the Alam et al. dataset is the primary dataset used in this research.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset. This will allow for easy reference and validation in future work or discussions regarding the research findings.
