To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Whispered and Lombard Neural Speech Synthesis" by Qiong Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss data collection and experiments**. The abstract mentions the generation of different speaking styles, which suggests that datasets related to these styles may be present.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for digital assistants to adapt to various environments, hinting at the use of specific datasets for training their models. However, I need to look for explicit mentions of datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Multi-Style Speech Corpus)**, where the authors describe the data collection process. They mention that they created a multi-style speech corpus consisting of recordings in normal, Lombard, and whisper styles. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including the duration of recordings and the number of sentences read.

The authors also reference additional datasets used for training their models. Specifically, they mention:

1. **CSTR Whisper TIMIT Plus Corpus**: This corpus contains 421 sentences selected from newspaper text, used for training whisper speech synthesis.
2. **Hurricane Natural Speech Corpus**: This corpus includes 720 sentences selected from the Harvard collection, used for Lombard speech synthesis.
3. **VCTK Corpus**: This is a multi-speaker dataset consisting of around 40 hours of audio, which was used to train the multi-speaker system.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **CSTR Whisper TIMIT Plus Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Yang, C., Brown, G., Lu, L., Yamagishi, J., & King, S. (2012). Noise-robust whispered speech recognition using a non-audible-murmur microphone with VTS compensation. In 2012 8th International Symposium on Chinese Spoken Language Processing. IEEE, 220–223.

- For the **Hurricane Natural Speech Corpus**, the citation is:

- For the **VCTK Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Veaux, C., Yamagishi, J., MacDonald, K., et al. (2016). SUPERSEDED-CSTR VCTK Corpus: English multi-speaker corpus for CSTR Voice Cloning Toolkit.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their relevance to the study's findings.
