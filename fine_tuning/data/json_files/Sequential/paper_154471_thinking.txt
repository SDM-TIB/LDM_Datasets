To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine learning approach for quantum non-Markovian noise classification" by Stefano Martina et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors use machine learning models trained on datasets generated from quantum system dynamics, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss various noise sources and their classification. They mention that they trained their models on six datasets, which is a clear indication that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in the subsection titled **Data set generation**, the authors describe how they generated the datasets for their experiments. They mention three different classification problems and provide details about the datasets:

1. **IID Dataset**: This dataset is used for supervised binary classification of i.i.d. noisy quantum dynamics. It consists of 20,000 samples generated with specific probability distributions.

2. **NM Dataset**: This dataset is for classifying two different colored noisy quantum dynamics, also containing 20,000 samples.

3. **VS Dataset**: This dataset is created for classifying between stochastic quantum dynamics affected by i.i.d. and colored noise, again with 20,000 samples.

The authors specify that each dataset is balanced and split into training, validation, and test sets, which is crucial for understanding how the datasets are structured.

Now, I will check the **references section** for full citations related to the datasets. However, since the datasets are generated by the authors and not sourced from external publications, I will note that the datasets do not have traditional citations. Instead, I will summarize the dataset details as follows:

- **IID Dataset**: Generated for binary classification of i.i.d. noise.
- **NM Dataset**: Generated for classification of colored noise dynamics.
- **VS Dataset**: Generated for classification between i.i.d. and colored noise.

Since these datasets are synthetic and created by the authors, I will not be able to provide external citations but will document the details as described in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that all relevant information is captured accurately.
