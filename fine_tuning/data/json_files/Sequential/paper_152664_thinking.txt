To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding Learned Models by Identifying Important Features at the Right Resolution" by Kyubin Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used. In this case, the authors discuss evaluating their approach in two biomedical applications, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to identify any specific datasets mentioned. The authors describe their approach and its relevance to understanding learned models, but I need to look for explicit mentions of datasets.

In the **methods section**, the authors detail their approach and mention two specific applications: identifying viral genotype-to-disease-phenotype associations and predicting asthma exacerbations from electronic health records (EHRs). I will look for any datasets associated with these applications.

Upon reviewing the **results section**, the authors provide insights into their findings related to the two applications. They mention using a dataset of 65 recombinant strains for the HSV-1 application and a cohort of 28,101 asthma patients for the EHR application. This gives me the names of the datasets I need to document.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section:

1. For the **HSV-1 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Kolb, A., Lee, K., Larsen, I., Craven, M., & Brandt, C. (2016). Quantitative trait locus based virulence determinant mapping of the HSV-1 genome in murine ocular infection: genes involved in viral regulatory and innate immune networks contribute to virulence. *PLoS Pathogens*, 12(3), e1005499.

2. For the **asthma exacerbation dataset**, the citation is:
   > Miotto, R., Li, L., Kidd, B. A., & Dudley, J. T. (2016). Deep patient: an unsupervised representation to predict the future of patients from the electronic health records. *Scientific Reports*, 6, 26094.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **HSV-1 Dataset**: Contains data from 65 recombinant strains of the herpes simplex virus type 1, represented as a vector of 547 features corresponding to haplotype blocks.
- **Asthma Exacerbation Dataset**: Comprises information from 28,101 asthma patients, including demographic features and timestamped events from electronic health records.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its full citation.
