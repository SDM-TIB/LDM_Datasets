To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SYSTRAN Purely Neural MT Engines for WMT2017" by Yongchao Deng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions participation in the WMT 2017 shared news translation task, which suggests that there are datasets involved, likely related to translation tasks.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Experiments)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, the authors mention the use of several parallel corpora for training their models. Specifically, they list:

1. **Europarl v7**: A parallel corpus derived from the proceedings of the European Parliament, commonly used for training translation models.
2. **Common Crawl corpus**: A large-scale web corpus that includes a wide variety of text data in multiple languages.
3. **News Commentary v12**: A dataset containing commentary on news articles, often used for training translation systems.
4. **Rapid corpus of EU press releases**: A collection of press releases from the European Union, also used for translation tasks.
5. **News Crawl**: Articles from 2016, which serve as additional monolingual data for both German and English.

I will also check for any additional datasets mentioned in the **training details** or **hyper-specialisation** sections, but the primary datasets are likely to be found in the experiments section.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the appropriate citations for the datasets:

- For **Europarl v7**, the citation is:
  > Philipp Koehn. *Europarl: A Parallel Corpus for Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the 10th Machine Translation Summit, pages 79â€“86, 2005.

- For **Common Crawl**, the citation is:
  > Common Crawl. *Common Crawl: A Non-Profit Organization that crawls the web and freely provides its archives and datasets to the public*. Available at: https://commoncrawl.org.

- For **News Commentary v12**, the citation is:
  > News Commentary. *News Commentary Dataset*. Available at: http://www.statmt.org/wmt17/translation-task.html.

- For **Rapid corpus of EU press releases**, the citation is:
  > European Union. *EU Press Releases*. Available at: https://europa.eu/press-release.

- For **News Crawl**, the citation is:
  > News Crawl. *News Crawl Dataset*. Available at: http://www.statmt.org/wmt17/translation-task.html.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations, ready to format them into the required structure for further processing or review.
