To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Congestion Control to Improve User Experience in IoT Using LSTM Network" by Atta Ur Rahman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions gathering IoT-specific data, which suggests that there may be a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Data Collection section** within the **Proposed Framework**. Here, the authors describe the types of data collected, including network traffic patterns, device interactions, and congestion occurrences. They mention that the data is gathered from routers, switches, and IoT gateways, but I need to look for specific dataset names or references.

In the **Experiments section**, the authors state that they used a combination of actual network traffic traces and simulation device interactions to create an extensive dataset tailored to IoT contexts. They specify that the dataset includes timestamps for congestion incidence, data rates, and packet arrival timings. However, they do not provide a formal name for this dataset.

Since the paper does not provide a specific dataset name or a citation for an existing dataset, I will note that the dataset is a custom collection created by the authors for their experiments. I will document this as follows:

1. **Custom IoT Dataset**: This dataset is tailored for IoT contexts and includes data from IoT devices such as sensors, actuators, and gateways. It contains timestamps for congestion incidents, data rates, and packet arrival timings. The dataset is divided into training (80%), validation (10%), and testing (10%) sets.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the cited works refer to datasets that could be relevant to the study. However, the references primarily discuss methodologies and previous works rather than specific datasets.

Since the authors did not provide formal citations for the datasets used in their experiments, I will create a citation for the custom dataset based on the authorship of the paper:

- For the **Custom IoT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Atta Ur Rahman, Bibi Saqia, Wali Ullah Khan, Khaled Rabie, Mahmood Alam, Khairullah Khan. *Enhancing Congestion Control to Improve User Experience in IoT Using LSTM Network*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will include the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that all necessary information is documented properly.
