To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporally Consistent Horizon Lines" by Florian Kluger et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors introduce an extension of the KITTI dataset with horizon line annotations, which suggests that this is a key dataset for their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (KITTI Horizon Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They mention that the KITTI Horizon Dataset is an extension of the well-known KITTI dataset and contains accurate horizon line annotations for 43,699 images across 72 video sequences. This section confirms that the KITTI Horizon Dataset is a primary dataset used in their experiments.

In addition, the authors discuss the limitations of existing datasets in this section, specifically mentioning three datasets commonly used for horizon line estimation: the York Urban Dataset (YUD), the Eurasian Cities Dataset (ECD), and the Horizon Lines in the Wild (HLW) dataset. I will need to extract information about these datasets as well.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **KITTI Dataset**:

2. **York Urban Dataset (YUD)**:
   > J. Lezama, R. Grompone von Gioi, G. Randall, and J.-M. Morel. *Finding vanishing points via point alignments in image primal and dual domains*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2014.

3. **Eurasian Cities Dataset (ECD)**:
   > O. Barinova, V. Lempitsky, E. Tretiak, and P. Kohli. *Geometric image parsing in man-made environments*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2010.

4. **Horizon Lines in the Wild (HLW)**:
   > S. Workman, M. Zhai, and N. Jacobs. *Horizon lines in the wild*. In Proceedings of the British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC), 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
