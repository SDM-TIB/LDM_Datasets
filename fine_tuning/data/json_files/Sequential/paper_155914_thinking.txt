To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GDB: Gated Convolutions-based Document Binarization" by Zongyuan Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **ten Document Image Binarization Contest (DIBCO) datasets from 2009 to 2019**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and evaluation metrics)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. They mention the following datasets:

1. **DIBCO’09**: This dataset is part of the Document Image Binarization Contest held in 2009.
2. **H-DIBCO’10**: This is the Handwritten Document Image Binarization Competition dataset from 2010.
3. **DIBCO’11**: The dataset from the 2011 Document Image Binarization Contest.
4. **H-DIBCO’12**: The dataset from the 2012 Handwritten Document Image Binarization Competition.
5. **DIBCO’13**: The dataset from the 2013 Document Image Binarization Contest.
6. **H-DIBCO’14**: The dataset from the 2014 Handwritten Document Image Binarization Competition.
7. **H-DIBCO’16**: The dataset from the 2016 Handwritten Document Image Binarization Competition.
8. **DIBCO’17**: The dataset from the 2017 Document Image Binarization Contest.
9. **H-DIBCO’18**: The dataset from the 2018 Handwritten Document Image Binarization Competition.
10. **DIBCO’19**: The dataset from the 2019 Document Image Binarization Contest.

Additionally, the authors mention that the training set includes images from the **Bickley Diary dataset**, the **Persian Heritage Image Binarization Dataset (PHIDB)**, and the **Synchromedia Multispectral dataset (S-MS)**.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the DIBCO datasets are typically included in the respective competition papers. Here are the citations I will include:

For the additional datasets, I will also look for their respective citations in the references section or other relevant papers.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
