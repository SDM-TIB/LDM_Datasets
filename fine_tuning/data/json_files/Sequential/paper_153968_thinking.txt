To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MomentumRNN: Integrating Momentum into Recurrent Neural Networks" by Tan M. Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (Section 3), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is widely used for handwritten digit classification tasks. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits, each of size 28x28 pixels.

2. **PMNIST Dataset**: This is a pixel-permuted version of the MNIST dataset, where the pixel order is randomized to test the model's ability to learn long-term dependencies.

3. **TIMIT Dataset**: This dataset contains real-world speech recordings and is used for speech prediction tasks. It consists of 3,640 utterances for training, 192 for validation, and 400 for testing.

4. **Penn TreeBank (PTB) Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for language modeling tasks. It contains a preprocessed version of text data with 10,000 unique words.

5. **Copying and Adding Tasks**: These are synthetic tasks designed to evaluate the model's ability to learn long-term dependencies. They involve sequences of characters or numbers.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and CJ Burges. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. ATT Labs [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist, 2010.

- For the **TIMIT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > John S. Garofolo. *TIMIT acoustic phonetic continuous speech corpus*. Linguistic Data Consortium, 1993.

- For the **Penn TreeBank Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tomáš Mikolov, Martin Karafiát, Lukáš Burget, Jan Černocký, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. *Recurrent neural network based language model*. In Eleventh Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association, 2010.

The PMNIST dataset is a variant of the MNIST dataset and does not have a separate citation, as it is derived from the original MNIST dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant information is captured accurately and comprehensively.
