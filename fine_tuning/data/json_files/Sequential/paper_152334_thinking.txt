To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Visual7W: Grounded Question Answering in Images" by Yuke Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper introduces a new dataset with 327,939 QA pairs on 47,300 COCO images, which is a strong indication that a dataset is being discussed.

Next, I will focus on **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors mention the Visual7W dataset and its features, including the number of QA pairs and the types of questions it includes. This section also references the Visual Genome project, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

In **section 3 (Creating the Visual7W Dataset)**, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset's collection process, including the number of images and the types of annotations. They mention that Visual7W is a subset of the Visual Genome project, which contains 1.7 million QA pairs. This section confirms the dataset's significance and its relationship to existing datasets.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The key datasets to extract are:

1. **Visual7W Dataset**: The authors describe it as containing 327,939 QA pairs on 47,300 COCO images, with additional annotations for object grounding and multiple-choice answers.

2. **Visual Genome**: This dataset is referenced as the source from which Visual7W is derived, containing 1.7 million QA pairs.

The full citations for these datasets are as follows:

- For **Visual7W Dataset**:
  > Yuke Zhu, Oliver Groth, Michael Bernstein, and Li Fei-Fei. *Visual7W: Grounded Question Answering in Images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019.

- For **Visual Genome**:
  > R. Krishna, Y. Zhu, O. Groth, J. Johnson, K. Hata, J. Kravitz, S. Chen, Y. Kalantidis, L.-J. Li, D. A. Shamma, M. Bernstein, and L. Fei-Fei. *Visual Genome: Connecting Language and Vision Using Crowdsourced Dense Image Annotations*. In arXiv preprint arXiv:1602.07332, 2016.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
