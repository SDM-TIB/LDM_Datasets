To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bilevel Learning Model Towards Industrial Scheduling" by Longkang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly looking for any subsections that explicitly discuss datasets. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their Bilevel Deep Scheduler (BDS) on a set of benchmarks consisting of **8 sub-datasets**. This indicates that there are multiple datasets involved, and I need to gather details about each one.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for tables or figures that summarize the datasets used, including their characteristics such as job numbers and operational parameters. The authors mention that the job numbers range from 100 to 800, and they describe the datasets in terms of their structure and the number of jobs.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites a benchmark dataset for the ordered flow shop scheduling problem, which is crucial for my extraction. The citation for this benchmark is:

- Khatami, M., Salehipour, A., & F.J., H. (2019). *Benchmarks for the ordered flow shop scheduling problem*. Computers and Operations Research. URL: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/cd2rv7hyyj/1.

Additionally, I will note any other datasets mentioned in the context of the experiments, such as those used for training, validation, and testing, and ensure I capture their details and citations.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
