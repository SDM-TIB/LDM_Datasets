To extract datasets from the research paper titled "COVID-19 Detection in Cough, Breath and Speech using Deep Transfer Learning and Bottleneck Features" by Madhurananda Pahar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used various datasets for their experiments, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on **Section 2 (Data)**, which is divided into two subsections: datasets without COVID-19 labels for pre-training and datasets with COVID-19 labels for classification. This section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used.

In **subsection 2.1 (Datasets without COVID-19 labels for pre-training)**, the authors mention five datasets:
1. **TASK dataset**: Contains 6000 cough audio samples from tuberculosis patients and 11393 non-cough audio samples.
2. **Brooklyn dataset**: Comprises 746 voluntary coughs from 38 subjects.
3. **Wallacedene dataset**: Includes 1358 voluntary coughs from 51 patients.
4. **Google Audio Set & Freesound**: Contains a collection of various audio samples, including coughs, sneezes, and speech.
5. **LibriSpeech**: A speech audio dataset with recordings from male and female speakers.

Then, I will look at **subsection 2.2 (Datasets with COVID-19 labels for classification)**, where three datasets are specified:
1. **Coswara dataset**: Developed for COVID-19 classification, containing cough, breath, and speech recordings.
2. **ComParE dataset**: Provided as part of the Interspeech Computational Paralinguistics Challenge, includes coughs and speech samples.
3. **Sarcos dataset**: Contains recordings of coughing from COVID-19 positive and negative subjects.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution.

The citations I will extract are:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for structured output or further processing.
