To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "TeCNO: Surgical Phase Recognition with Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional Networks" by Tobias Czempiel et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the method is evaluated on two datasets of laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **Cholec80 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 80 laparoscopic videos recorded at 25 frames per second, with each frame manually assigned to one of seven surgical phase classes. The dataset is subsampled to 5 fps, resulting in approximately 92,000 frames. The authors also mention the split used for training, validation, and testing.

2. **Cholec51 Dataset**: This is an in-house dataset containing 51 laparoscopic videos, also recorded at 1 fps. It includes seven surgical phases, which differ slightly from those in Cholec80, and is annotated by expert physicians. The authors specify the number of videos used for training, validation, and testing.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Cholec80 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. P. Twinanda, S. Shehata, D. Mutter, J. Marescaux, M. De Mathelin, and N. Padoy. *EndoNet: A Deep Architecture for Recognition Tasks on Laparoscopic Videos*. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, vol. 36, no. 1, pp. 86â€“97, 2017.

- For **Cholec51 Dataset**, since it is an in-house dataset, it may not have a formal citation in the references. However, it is important to note that it is mentioned as being annotated by expert physicians.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.
