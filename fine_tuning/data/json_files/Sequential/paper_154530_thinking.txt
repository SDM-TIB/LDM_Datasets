To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Meta-Learning for Koopman Spectral Analysis with Short Time-series" by Tomoharu Iwata and Yoshinobu Kawahara, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus but may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction will likely provide context and may reference specific datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention four datasets: 

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset is generated using a linear transition matrix and a nonlinear transformation via a feed-forward neural network. It consists of 81 time-series with varying dynamics.

2. **Van-der-Pol Dataset**: This dataset is generated using the van der Pol oscillator, which is a well-known model in various scientific fields. The authors generated 100 time-series with different dynamics based on varying parameters.

3. **Lorenz Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the Lorenz system, which is known for its chaotic solutions. The authors generated 900 time-series with different dynamics by varying specific parameters.

4. **Cylinder-wake Dataset**: This dataset is generated using a fluid dynamics simulator, resulting in 100 time-series with different dynamics based on various grid locations and Reynolds numbers.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are generated or derived from known models rather than published datasets, I will provide the relevant citations for the models used to generate them:

- For the **Van-der-Pol oscillator**, the citation is:
  > B. Van der Pol. *On relaxation-oscillations*. The London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science, 2(11):978–992, 1926.

- For the **Lorenz system**, the citation is:
  > E. N. Lorenz. *Deterministic nonperiodic flow*. Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences, 20(2):130–141, 1963.

The **Synthetic Dataset** and **Cylinder-wake Dataset** do not have specific citations since they are generated based on the authors' methods and models.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the models used to generate the datasets. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
