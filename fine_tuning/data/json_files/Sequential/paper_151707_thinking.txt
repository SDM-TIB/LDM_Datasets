To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Chinese NER Using Lattice LSTM" by Yue Zhang and Jie Yang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on various datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors describe the datasets used. In **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, the authors explicitly list four datasets:

1. **OntoNotes**: This dataset is referenced as being used for named entity recognition (NER) tasks. The authors mention that it is a well-known dataset in the field.

2. **MSRA**: Another dataset mentioned for NER, specifically in the context of Chinese language processing.

3. **Weibo NER**: This dataset is derived from social media and is used for NER tasks, highlighting its relevance in a different domain compared to the previous datasets.

4. **Chinese Resume Dataset**: This dataset is annotated by the authors and consists of resumes from senior executives, which adds a unique aspect to the research.

In the **statistics tables** (Table 1 and Table 2), the authors provide detailed statistics about each dataset, including the number of training, development, and test samples, which further confirms their usage in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **OntoNotes**, the citation is:
  > Ralph Weischedel, Sameer Pradhan, Lance Ramshaw, Martha Palmer, Nianwen Xue, Mitchell Marcus, Ann Taylor, Craig Greenberg, Eduard Hovy, Robert Belvin, et al. *Ontonotes release 4.0*. LDC2011T03, Philadelphia, Penn.: Linguistic Data Consortium, 2011.

- For **MSRA**, the citation is:
  > Gina-Anne Levow. *The third international Chinese language processing bakeoff: Word segmentation and named entity recognition*. In Proceedings of the Fifth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing, pages 108–117, 2006.

- For **Weibo NER**, the citation is:
  > Nanyun Peng and Mark Dredze. *Named entity recognition for Chinese social media with jointly trained embeddings*. In EMNLP, pages 548–554, 2015.

- For the **Chinese Resume Dataset**, the authors mention that they collected and annotated this dataset, but it does not have a formal citation since it is newly introduced in this paper. I will note that it is a resource released by the authors.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included for reference. This structured approach will help in organizing the datasets effectively for further analysis or use.
