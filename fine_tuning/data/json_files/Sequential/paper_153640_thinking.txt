To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gating creates slow modes and controls phase-space complexity in GRUs and LSTMs" by Tankut Can et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract typically provides a concise overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, as this is where authors usually describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, or specific tasks for which the datasets were used.

If the datasets are not clearly listed in the experiments section, I will check the **appendices** or **supplementary materials**, as authors sometimes provide additional details about datasets there.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to note down their full citations. This involves checking the **references section** of the paper to find the original sources of the datasets. I will look for the complete citation format, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if I find a dataset named "XYZ Dataset" used in the experiments, I will look for its citation in the references. If the citation is formatted as follows:
> Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. Year. Publisher/Journal.

I will document it accordingly.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified and properly referenced.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
