To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Emotion Classification in a Resource Constrained Language Using Transformer-based Approach" by Avishek Das et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that a Bengali emotion corpus consisting of **6243 texts** was developed for the classification task, which indicates that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (BEmoC: Bengali Emotion Corpus)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they describe the corpus development process, including data collection, preprocessing, and annotation. They mention that the corpus contains **6243 text documents** annotated for six basic emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise. This section confirms that the BEmoC is the main dataset used in their experiments.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **experiments** or **results** sections, but it appears that the focus is primarily on the BEmoC dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the BEmoC dataset. Since the authors have developed this dataset themselves, I will cite it as follows:

- For the **BEmoC dataset**, the citation is:
  > Avishek Das, Omar Sharif, Mohammed Moshiul Hoque, and Iqbal H. Sarker. *BEmoC: Bengali Emotion Corpus*. Available at: https://github.com/omar-sharif03/NAACL-SRW-2021.

With this information, I have successfully identified and cited the dataset used in the research paper. I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
