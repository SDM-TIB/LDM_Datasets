To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Soft-DTW: a Differentiable Loss Function for Time-Series" by Marco Cuturi and Mathieu Blondel, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a differentiable loss function for time series, but it does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and experimental sections for more details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of supervised learning with time series but do not mention specific datasets. However, in the **experimental results section (Section 4)**, the authors provide a detailed account of their experiments, which includes references to specific datasets.

I will look closely at **Section 4.1 (Averaging experiments)** and **Section 4.2 (k-means clustering experiments)**, where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for evaluation. They mention using the **UCR time series classification archive**, which is a well-known collection of datasets for time series analysis.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the UCR time series classification archive. The citation is as follows:
> Chen, Yanping, Keogh, Eamonn, Hu, Bing, Begum, Nurjahan, Bagnall, Anthony, Mueen, Abdullah, and Batista, Gustavo. *The UCR time series classification archive*. www.cs.ucr.edu/Ëœeamonn/time_series_data/, July 2015.

Additionally, I will note that the authors mention using various datasets from this archive, such as **50words, Adiac, ArrowHead, Beef, BeetleFly, BirdChicken**, and many others. However, since the paper does not provide individual citations for each dataset, I will only document the UCR archive citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the UCR time series classification archive as it is the primary source of the datasets used in the experiments.

In summary, the steps I will take are:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and experimental sections to identify datasets.
2. Focus on the experimental results for specific dataset mentions.
3. Document the UCR time series classification archive citation as the source of the datasets.
4. Compile the information for structured output.

This approach will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets referenced in the paper.
