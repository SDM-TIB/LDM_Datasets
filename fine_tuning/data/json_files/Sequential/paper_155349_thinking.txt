To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multilingual Pre-training with Language and Task Adaptation for Multilingual Text Style Transfer" by Huiyuan Lai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize machine-translated data and gold-aligned English sentences, which suggests that there are datasets involved. The introduction mentions the **XFORMAL** benchmark, which is a clear indication of a dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **Approach and Data** section, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, their characteristics, and their purposes in the context of the research.

1. **GYAFC Dataset**: This dataset is explicitly mentioned as an English dataset of aligned formal and informal sentences, which is used for training, validation, and testing. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Rao, S., & Tetreault, J. (2018). Dear sir or madam, may I introduce the GYAFC dataset: Corpus, benchmarks and metrics for formality style transfer. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 129–140, New Orleans, Louisiana. Association for Computational Linguistics.

2. **XFORMAL Dataset**: This is a benchmark for multilingual formality transfer, providing an evaluation set consisting of formal rewrites of informal sentences in Brazilian Portuguese, French, and Italian. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Briakou, E., Lu, D., Zhang, K., & Tetreault, J. (2021). Olá, bonjour, salve! XFORMAL: A benchmark for multilingual formality style transfer. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 3199–3216, Online. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Additionally, the authors mention that they crawled domain data from Yahoo Answers for language-specific non-parallel data. While this is not a formal dataset with a citation, it is important to note its source.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to ensure that I have the correct citations for each dataset. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
