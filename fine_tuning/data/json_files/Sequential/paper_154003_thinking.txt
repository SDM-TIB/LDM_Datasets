To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Movie Box office Prediction via Joint Actor Representations and Social Media Sentiment" by Dezhou Shen, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions the use of film data and social network characteristics, which suggests that datasets related to films and social media sentiment might be involved.

Next, I will examine the **data** section, specifically **section 3**, where the author discusses the datasets used for analysis. Here, I find that the author collected data on:

1. **Chinese films**: A total of 3,669 films released in the Chinese mainland from 2011 to 2015, along with 14,234 actors.
2. **Sina Weibo posts**: The retweets and tweets of 8,508 actors on the Sina Weibo social network.

The paper also mentions the extraction of sentiment characteristics from the Sina Weibo posts, which indicates that sentiment analysis was performed on the collected data.

In **section 2.3**, the author discusses the sentiment characteristics of movie-related Sina Weibo posts, which includes a table summarizing the sentiment analysis results for specific movies. This section provides quantitative data that can be considered part of the dataset.

I will also check the **references** section to find full citations for any datasets or studies that are referenced. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

The citations I need to extract include:

- For the dataset of **Chinese films** and their box office data, I will refer to the original source of the data, which is likely the China-Box-Office database or similar sources, but I will need to confirm this in the references.
- For the **Sina Weibo sentiment analysis**, I will look for any studies that have previously analyzed social media sentiment in relation to film performance, as these may provide foundational datasets or methodologies.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation for proper referencing.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and ensure that all datasets are accurately represented with their respective citations, ready for inclusion in any further analysis or reporting.
