To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "Fine-tune Bert for DocRED" by Hong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract introduces a new dataset called **DocRED**, which is a key focus of the research. This indicates that I should look for more details about this dataset in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will examine **section 3.1 (DocRED Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the DocRED dataset. They mention that it is collected through distant supervision on Wikipedia documents and Wikidata, and they provide statistics about the dataset, such as the number of documents, relations, instances, and facts. This section confirms that DocRED is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

The authors also reference the original paper that introduced the DocRED dataset, which is crucial for obtaining the full citation. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Yuan Yao, Deming Ye, Peng Li, Xu Han, Yankai Lin, Zhenghao Liu, Zhiyuan Liu, Lixin Huang, Jie Zhou, and Maosong Sun. *DocRED: A large-scale document-level relation extraction dataset*. In Proceedings of ACL 2019.

Since DocRED is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will ensure to include all relevant details about it, including its collection method, coverage, and the types of entities and relations it includes.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation for the DocRED dataset is included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset as used in the research paper.
