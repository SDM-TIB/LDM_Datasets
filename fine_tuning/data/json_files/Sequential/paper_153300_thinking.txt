To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Entity-Consistent End-to-end Task-Oriented Dialogue System with KB Retriever" by Libo Qin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the experiments were conducted on "two publicly available task-oriented dialog datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the introduction, the authors refer to the datasets as "Camrest" and "InCar Assistant," which are likely the datasets used for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they used the **InCar Assistant dataset** (Eric et al., 2017) and the **CamRest dataset** (Wen et al., 2017b). This provides a clear indication of the datasets utilized in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **InCar Assistant dataset**, the citation is:
   > Mihail Eric, Lakshmi Krishnan, Francois Charette, and Christopher D Manning. *Key-value retrieval networks for task-oriented dialogue*. In Proceedings of the SIGDial Conference on Discourse and Dialogue, pages 1-10, 2017.

2. For the **CamRest dataset**, the citation is:
   > Haoyang Wen, Yijia Liu, Wanxiang Che, Libo Qin, and Ting Liu. *Sequence-to-sequence learning for task-oriented dialogue with dialogue state representation*. In Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING), pages 1-10, 2018.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **InCar Assistant dataset**: A dataset used for task-oriented dialogue systems, focusing on navigation, weather, and calendar domains.
- **CamRest dataset**: A dataset designed for task-oriented dialogue systems, specifically for restaurant booking scenarios.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that each dataset is properly cited.
