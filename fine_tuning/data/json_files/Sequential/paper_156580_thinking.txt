To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic driving lane change safety prediction model based on LSTM" by Wenjian Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, which may hint at the datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to specific datasets. The authors discuss the need for a large amount of lane change execution data, which suggests that they may have utilized existing datasets for their model training.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets used in the experiments. The authors may describe the datasets in detail, including their characteristics, size, and the context in which they were used. If the paper includes a dedicated section on datasets, I will pay close attention to that.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any performance metrics or comparisons based on the datasets. This can help confirm the relevance and application of the datasets in their research.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. It is crucial to ensure that I capture the correct citation format, including all authors, title, publication venue, and year.

If the paper references well-known datasets, I will also look for their original publications to provide authoritative citations. For example, if they mention the NGSIM dataset, I will find the original paper that introduced it.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets from the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and completeness in the citations.
