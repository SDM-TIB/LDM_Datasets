To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rainfall–Runoff Prediction at Multiple Timescales with a Single Long Short-Term Memory Network" by Martin Gauch et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors benchmark their models on **516 basins across the continental United States**, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Data and Methods)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention the **CAMELS dataset**, which is crucial for their study. They state that they used **516 basins** from the CAMELS dataset that have hourly stream gauge data available from the USGS Water Information System.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to the **NLDAS-2 product** for hourly meteorological forcing data, which is another dataset relevant to their study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **CAMELS dataset**: The citation is:
   > Addor, N., Newman, A., Mizukami, N., and Clark, M. P. (2017). The CAMELS data set: catchment attributes and meteorology for large-sample studies. *Hydrology and Earth System Sciences*, 21, 5293–5313. https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-5293-2017.

2. **NLDAS-2 product**: The citation is:
   > Xia, Y., Mitchell, K., Ek, M., Sheffield, J., Cosgrove, B., Wood, E., Luo, L., Alonge, C., Wei, H., Meng, J., Livneh, B., Lettenmaier, D., Koren, V., Duan, Q., Mo, K., Fan, Y., and Mocko, D. (2012). Continental-scale water and energy flux analysis and validation for the North American Land Data Assimilation System project phase 2 (NLDAS-2): 1. Intercomparison and application of model products. *Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres*, 117. https://doi.org/10.1029/2011JD016048.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **CAMELS dataset**: A dataset containing hydrometeorological data for 531 basins across the continental United States, with 516 basins having hourly stream gauge data available.
2. **NLDAS-2 product**: A dataset providing hourly meteorological data since 1979, used for forcing in the rainfall-runoff models.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
