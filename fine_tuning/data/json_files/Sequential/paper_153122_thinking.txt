To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Speaker End-to-End Speech Synthesis" by Jihyun Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors extend ClariNet for multi-speaker speech synthesis, which suggests that they likely used specific datasets for training and evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Data and preprocessing)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training their model. Here, they mention the **VCTK dataset**, which consists of audio recordings from 108 speakers, totaling approximately 44 hours of audio. This is a key dataset for their experiments.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper, especially in the **related work** or **conclusion** sections. However, the primary focus appears to be on the VCTK dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the VCTK dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For the **VCTK dataset**:
  > J. Yamagishi, T. Nose, H. Zen, Z.-H. Ling, T. Toda, K. Tokuda, S. King, and S. Renals. Robust speaker-adaptive HMM-based text-to-speech synthesis. *IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing*, 17(6):1208â€“1230, 2009a.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information regarding the VCTK dataset, including its description and citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that the full citation is included for the VCTK dataset. This will ensure that all necessary information is accurately captured and ready for further processing or review.
