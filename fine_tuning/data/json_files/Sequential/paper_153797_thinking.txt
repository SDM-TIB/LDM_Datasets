To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepSentiPers: Novel Deep Learning Models Trained Over Proposed Augmented Persian Sentiment Corpus" by Javad PourMostafa Roshan Sharami et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the creation of a novel model for classifying Persian opinions and highlights the need for a well-annotated Persian sentiment corpus. This suggests that a dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3 (Data Preparation)**, as it is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used. Here, the authors specifically mention the **SentiPers** dataset, which is described as holding customer reviews from an online shopping website named Digikala. The dataset consists of 7,415 annotated sentences, categorized by polarity and emotion classes.

In **section 3.1**, the authors explain how the dataset was prepared and annotated by native speakers, which provides further context about its construction and relevance. This section confirms that SentiPers is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SentiPers dataset. The citation provided is:
> Pedram Hosseini, Ali Ahmadian Ramaki, Hassan Maleki, Mansoureh Anvari, and Seyed Abolghasem Mirroshandel. *Sentipers: A sentiment analysis corpus for persian*. CoRR, abs/1801.07737, 2018.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that SentiPers is the only dataset referenced in this research.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will allow for easy access and understanding of the dataset used in the study.
