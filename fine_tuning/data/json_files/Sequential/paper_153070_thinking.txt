To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scalable Neural Architecture Search for 3D Medical Image Segmentation" by Sungwoong Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a "benchmark dataset" for 3D medical image segmentation, which indicates that there are datasets involved. I will look for specific names and details in the introduction and experiments sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges in medical image segmentation and the need for automated methods, but they do not specify any datasets yet. I will move on to the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation process.

In the **experiments section**, they explicitly mention three datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Brain Tumor Dataset**: This dataset consists of 484 labeled MRI images with 3 classes (Edema, Non-Enhancing, Enhancing). 

2. **Heart Dataset**: This dataset contains 20 labeled MRI images with 1 class (Left Atrium).

3. **Lung Dataset**: This dataset includes 64 labeled CT images with 1 class (Tumor).

Next, I will check the **bibliography section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper references the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) challenge, which is the source of these datasets. The citation for the MSD challenge is:

> Isensee, F., Petersen, J., Klein, A., Zimmerer, D., Jaeger, P.F., Kohl, S., Wasserthal, J., Koehler, G., Norajitra, T., Wirkert, S., Maier-Hein, K.H. (2018). *nnu-net: Self-adapting framework for u-net-based medical image segmentation*. 

Now, I will compile the dataset information along with the citations into a structured format for clarity.

1. **Brain Tumor Dataset**: 
   - Description: 484 labeled MRI images, 3 classes (Edema, Non-Enhancing, Enhancing).
   - Citation: Isensee et al. (2018).

2. **Heart Dataset**: 
   - Description: 20 labeled MRI images, 1 class (Left Atrium).
   - Citation: Isensee et al. (2018).

3. **Lung Dataset**: 
   - Description: 64 labeled CT images, 1 class (Tumor).
   - Citation: Isensee et al. (2018).

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clearly articulated and ready for any further processing or review.
