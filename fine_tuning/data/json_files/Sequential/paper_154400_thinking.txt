To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BERT-hLSTMs: BERT and Hierarchical LSTMs for Visual Storytelling" by Jing Su et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a public visual storytelling dataset (VIST), which indicates that a dataset is involved. I will note this down as a potential dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges of visual storytelling and reference the VIST dataset. They mention that the dataset contains stories with images annotated with corresponding descriptions, which provides context for its use in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for specific details about the dataset used. The authors explicitly state that they evaluate their model on the VIST dataset, which contains 10,117 Flickr albums and 210,819 unique photos. They also describe the two types of descriptions available in the dataset: descriptions of images-in-isolation (DII) and stories for images-in-sequence (SIS). This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the VIST dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Huang, T.H.K., Ferraro, F., Mostafazadeh, N., Misra, I., Agrawal, A., Devlin, J., Girshick, R., He, X., Kohli, P., Batra, D., Zitnick, C.L., Parikh, D., Vanderwende, L., Galley, M., Mitchell, M., 2016. Visual storytelling. In: the Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 1233â€“1239.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extraction:

1. **VIST Dataset**: This dataset is used for visual storytelling and contains 10,117 Flickr albums with 210,819 unique photos. It provides two types of descriptions: DII and SIS, which are essential for training and evaluating the model.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I include the full citation for the VIST dataset as it is critical for proper attribution.
