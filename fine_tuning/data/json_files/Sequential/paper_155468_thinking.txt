To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DTW at Qur’an QA 2022: Utilising Transfer Learning with Transformers for Question Answering in a Low-resource Domain" by Damith Premasiri et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a shared task related to question answering on the Qur’an, which suggests that there may be specific datasets involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the Qur’an QA 2022 shared task and refer to a dataset of **1,337 question-passage-answer triplets** extracted from the holy Qur’an. This is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will focus on the **data section** where the authors provide more detailed information about the datasets used. They mention the **Quran Reading Comprehension Dataset (QRCD)**, which contains 1,093 tuples of question-passage pairs and 1,337 question-passage-answer triplets. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Additionally, the authors discuss another dataset called **SOQAL**, which includes two Arabic MRC datasets: the **Arabic Reading Comprehension Dataset (ARCD)** and a machine translation of the SQuAD dataset. The ARCD consists of 1,395 questions posed by crowdworkers on Wikipedia articles, while the SQuAD translation contains 48,344 questions. Both datasets are relevant for transfer learning in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. For the **Quran Reading Comprehension Dataset (QRCD)**, the citation is:
   > Malhas, R. and Elsayed, T. (2020). Ayatec: Building a reusable verse-based test collection for Arabic question answering on the holy Qur’an. ACM Trans. Asian Low-Resour. Lang. Inf. Process., 19(6), oct.

2. For the **Arabic Reading Comprehension Dataset (ARCD)** and the machine translation of SQuAD, the citation for SOQAL is:
   > Mozannar, H., Maamary, E., El Hajal, K., and Hajj, H. (2019). Neural Arabic question answering. In Proceedings of the Fourth Arabic Natural Language Processing Workshop, pages 108–118, Florence, Italy, August. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, as this is crucial for proper attribution in research.
