To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analysis of Multilingual Sequence-to-Sequence Speech Recognition Systems" by Martin Karaﬁát et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using **Babel data**, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine the **data section** (Section 3) more closely, as it is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors mention that the experiments are conducted using the **BABEL speech corpus**, which is a key dataset for their research. They describe it as primarily composed of conversational telephone speech (CTS) and provide a table (Table 1) with details about the languages used for training and evaluation.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **experiments** or **results** sections. However, the focus seems to be primarily on the BABEL dataset, as it is the main corpus referenced throughout the paper.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the BABEL dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the BABEL dataset itself, but they reference their previous work and related studies that may include details about the dataset. I will note that the BABEL program is associated with the IARPA (Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity), which may provide additional context for citation.

The citation for the BABEL program can be referenced as follows:
> IARPA. *Babel Program*. [Online]. Available: https://www.iarpa.gov/index.php/research-programs/babel

Since the BABEL dataset is a well-known corpus in the speech recognition community, I will also include a general citation for the program itself, as it is commonly referenced in related literature.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the BABEL dataset as part of my final output. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work.
