To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-label Classification of User Reactions in Online News" by Zacarias Curi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a new corpus called BFRC-PT, which is a significant clue that a dataset is presented.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Portuguese news corpora)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will find two datasets:

1. **G1 Corpus**: This dataset consists of 2,000 titles and headlines of news articles extracted from the G1 website, annotated with six basic emotions and a neutral class. The authors provide details about the annotation process and the class distribution.

2. **BuzzFeed Reactions Corpus (BFRC-PT)**: This is a new corpus introduced in the paper, consisting of 8,080 entertainment news articles written in Brazilian Portuguese, annotated with user reactions. The authors describe the collection process and the criteria for annotation.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **G1 Corpus**, the citation is:
> Dosciatti, M. M., Ferreira, L. P. C., & Paraiso, E. C. (2015). Anotando um Corpus de Notícias para a Análise de Sentimentos: um Relato de Experiência. In Proceedings of the Brazilian Symposium in Information and Human Language Technology, 121–130.

For the **BuzzFeed Reactions Corpus (BFRC-PT)**, since it is a new corpus introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:
> Curi, Z., Britto Jr, A. S., & Paraiso, E. C. (2023). BuzzFeed Reactions Corpus (BFRC-PT). Available at: https://www.ppgia.pucpr.br/~paraiso/mineracaodeemocoes/recursos.php.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the paper.
