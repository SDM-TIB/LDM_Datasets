To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Self-Attentional Neural Architecture for Code Completion with Multi-Task Learning" by Fang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on three real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they state that they conducted experiments on three datasets: **Python, Java, and JavaScript**. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were collected.

In **subsection 5.1 (Dataset and Metrics)**, the authors provide specific details about each dataset:
1. **Python Dataset**: Collected from GitHub repositories, containing 100,000 training programs and 50,000 test programs. The dataset includes ASTs and source code files.
2. **Java Dataset**: Also collected from GitHub, with the same number of training and test programs as the Python dataset.
3. **JavaScript Dataset**: Similar collection method as the Python dataset, with the same number of training and test programs.

The authors mention that the Python and JavaScript datasets were used in previous works, specifically citing Li et al. [21] and Raychev et al. [32]. This indicates that these datasets have been previously validated in the literature.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the relevant papers are:
- For the Python and JavaScript datasets:
  > Jian Li, Yue Wang, Michael R. Lyu, and Irwin King. *Code Completion with Neural Attention and Pointer Networks*. In Proceedings of the Twenty-Seventh International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), July 13-19, 2018, Stockholm, Sweden. https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/578

- For the Java dataset:
  > Xing Hu, Ge Li, Xin Xia, David Lo, Shuai Lu, and Zhi Jin. *Summarizing Source Code with Transferred API Knowledge*. In Proceedings of the Twenty-Seventh International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), July 13-19, 2018, Stockholm, Sweden.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format, ensuring clarity and completeness for each dataset extracted from the paper.
