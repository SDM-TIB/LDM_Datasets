To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Attention-based Neural Text Segmentation" by Pinkesh Badjatiya et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed model is evaluated on "three benchmark datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they provide a summary of three datasets:

1. **Clinical Dataset**: This dataset consists of 227 chapters from a medical textbook, with segmentation boundaries marked by the author, totaling 1136 sections.

2. **Fiction Dataset**: This dataset includes 85 fiction books sourced from Project Gutenberg, where segmentation boundaries correspond to chapter breaks.

3. **Wikipedia Dataset**: This dataset comprises a randomly selected set of 300 documents, each divided into sections as marked in the original XML dump of the website.

After identifying the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Clinical Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Malioutov, I., & Barzilay, R. (2006). Minimum Cut Model for Spoken Lecture Segmentation. In ACL (pp. 25–32).

- For the **Fiction Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hearst, M.A. (1997). TextTiling: Segmenting Text into Multi-Paragraph Subtopic Passages. COLING 23(1), 33–64.

- For the **Wikipedia Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Beeferman, D., Berger, A., & Lafferty, J. (1999). Statistical Models for Text Segmentation. Machine Learning, 34(1), 177–210.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
