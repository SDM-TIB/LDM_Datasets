To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Survey of Natural Language Generation Techniques with a Focus on Dialogue Systems - Past, Present and Future Directions" by Sashank Santhanam and Samira Shaikh, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to look for specific references to datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any mentions of datasets used in previous studies or surveys. The authors may reference well-known datasets in the field of Natural Language Generation (NLG) or dialogue systems.

I will then look for a **dedicated section on datasets** or any tables that summarize the datasets used in the studies reviewed. In this paper, there is a **Table 1** that summarizes various deep learning-based open-domain dialogue systems, which includes columns for the authors, corpora used, architecture, optimization strategies, and evaluation metrics. This table is crucial as it likely contains the names of datasets.

From Table 1, I will extract the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Open Subtitles**: A dataset commonly used for training dialogue systems, consisting of subtitles from movies and TV shows.
2. **Twitter Conversation Dialogues**: A dataset derived from conversations on Twitter, useful for training models on informal dialogue.
3. **Cornell Movie Dialogues**: A dataset containing movie character dialogues, often used for training conversational agents.
4. **PERSONA Chat Dataset**: A dataset designed for training dialogue systems with personality traits.
5. **Reddit Dataset**: A dataset sourced from discussions on Reddit, useful for various conversational tasks.
6. **Movie Triples**: A dataset that includes triples of movie-related dialogues, often used for training and evaluating dialogue systems.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide context for each dataset's origin.

For example, the citation for the **Open Subtitles** dataset might be:
> Lison, P., & Tiedemann, J. (2016). OpenSubtitles2016: Extracting Large Parallel Corpora from Movie and TV Subtitles. In Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2016).

Once I have gathered the dataset names and their citations, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described, including its purpose and any relevant details about its structure or content.

Finally, I will compile all the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
