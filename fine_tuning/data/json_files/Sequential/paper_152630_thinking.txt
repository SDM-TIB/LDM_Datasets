To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Linear Time Neural Machine Translation with Capsule Networks" by Mingxuan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on the **WMT14 English-German** and **WMT14 English-French** translation tasks, which indicates that these are the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide specific details about the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **WMT14 English-German Dataset**: This dataset consists of 4.5 million sentence pairs with 91 million English words and 87 million German words. The validation set is formed from the concatenation of news-test 2012 and news-test 2013, while news-test 2014 is used as the test set.

2. **WMT14 English-French Dataset**: This dataset contains 36 million sentence pairs. Similar to the English-German dataset, the validation set is formed from the concatenation of news-test 2012 and news-test 2013, with news-test 2014 serving as the test set.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the WMT datasets are typically attributed to the WMT conference proceedings, but I will ensure to find the exact references used in this paper.

For the **WMT14 English-German Dataset**, the citation is:
> Christian Buck, Kenneth Heafield, and Bas Van Ooyen. *N-gram counts and language models from the common crawl*. In LREC, volume 2, page 4, 2014.

For the **WMT14 English-French Dataset**, the citation is the same as it is part of the same WMT conference:
> Christian Buck, Kenneth Heafield, and Bas Van Ooyen. *N-gram counts and language models from the common crawl*. In LREC, volume 2, page 4, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
