To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Estimating Ground Reaction Forces from Inertial Sensors" by B. Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses data collected from inertial measurement units (IMUs) during running, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Notation and Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention using an existing dataset consisting of 44 collegiate distance runners from various universities. This section provides key details about the dataset, including the number of participants, the type of data collected, and the conditions under which the data was gathered.

The dataset is described as follows:
- **Pac-12 Dataset**: This dataset includes data from 44 competitive collegiate distance runners (25 female and 19 male) from the University of Colorado Boulder, University of Oregon, and Stanford University. It consists of 114 collections of running data at multiple speeds, with ground reaction force (GRF) data collected at 1,000 Hz and IMU data at 500 Hz.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference their dataset as being collected in accordance with the Institutional Review Board for research involving human participants, but they do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself. However, they mention that a subset of this dataset has been used in other studies, which could be useful for citation purposes.

To summarize the dataset extraction:
1. **Dataset Name**: Pac-12 Dataset
   - **Description**: Contains data from 44 collegiate distance runners, including GRF and IMU data collected during running at various speeds.
   - **Citation**: While the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset, it is associated with the Institutional Review Board approval and can be referenced as:
     > B. Song, M. Paolieri, H. E. Stewart, L. Golubchik, J. L. McNitt-Gray, V. Misra, D. Shah. *Estimating Ground Reaction Forces from Inertial Sensors*. IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 2024.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details into a structured format for further use or analysis.
