To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Video-Text Representation Learning via Differentiable Weak Temporal Alignment" by Dohwan Ko et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors discuss a large-scale dataset called **HowTo100M**, which is a strong lead for dataset extraction.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention several datasets used in their work, including **MSR-VTT**, **DiDeMo**, and **EPIC-KITCHENS**. I will note these names as potential datasets to extract.

In the **related work section**, the authors reference the **HowTo100M dataset** again, providing more context about its size and characteristics. This section also mentions the challenges associated with using this dataset, which reinforces its importance in their research.

Moving on to the **method section**, I will look for any additional datasets that may be referenced in the context of their experiments or methodology. The authors describe their framework and its application to various datasets, confirming the use of **HowTo100M** for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations I need to extract are:

1. **HowTo100M**:
   > Miech, A., Alayrac, J.-B., Smaira, L., Laptev, I., Sivic, J., & Zisserman, A. (2019). *HowTo100M: Learning a text-video embedding by watching hundred million narrated video clips*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

2. **MSR-VTT**:
   > Xu, J., Mei, T., Yao, T., & Rui, Y. (2016). *MSR-VTT: A large video description dataset for bridging video and language*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

3. **DiDeMo**:
   > Hendricks, L. A., Wang, O., Shechtman, E., Sivic, J., Darrell, T., & Russell, B. (2017). *Localizing moments in video with natural language*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

4. **EPIC-KITCHENS**:
   > Damen, D., Doughty, H., Farinella, G. M., Fidler, S., Furnari, A., Kazakos, E., Moltisanti, D., Munro, J., Perrett, W., Price, W., et al. (2018). *Scaling egocentric vision: The EPIC-KITCHENS dataset*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the references provided in the paper. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets utilized in the research.
