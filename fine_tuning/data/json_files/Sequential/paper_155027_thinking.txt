To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multiscale Manifold Warping" by Sridhar Mahadevan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions that the proposed methods are evaluated on several real-world datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 7) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for testing their methods. In this section, the authors mention three real-world datasets:

1. **COIL-100 Dataset**: This dataset is described as consisting of different series of images taken of various objects on a rotating platform. The authors reference the original source of this dataset.

2. **Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Dataset**: This dataset involves recordings made on a Samsung smartphone, capturing various human activities. The authors provide a citation for the original work that introduced this dataset.

3. **CMU Quality of Life Dataset**: This dataset records human subjects cooking a variety of dishes and is referenced in the context of their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For the **COIL-100 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. A. Nene, S. K. Nayar. *Columbia Object Image Library (COIL-100)*. Technical Report CUCS-006-96, February 1996.

- For the **Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jorge-Luis Reyes-Ortiz, Luca Oneto, Alessandro Ghio, Albert Samá, Davide Anguita, and Xavier Parra. *Human activity recognition on smartphones with awareness of basic activities and postural transitions*. In Artificial Neural Networks and Machine Learning – ICANN 2014, pages 177–184, Cham, 2014. Springer International Publishing.

- For the **CMU Quality of Life Dataset**, the citation is:
  > F. De la Torre, J. Hodgins, A. Bargteil, X. Martin, J. Macey, A. Collado, and P. Beltran. *Guide to the Carnegie Mellon University multimodal activity (CMU-MMAC) database*, 2008.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
