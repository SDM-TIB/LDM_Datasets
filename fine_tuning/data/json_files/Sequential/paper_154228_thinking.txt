To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating the Acquisition of Grammar from Limited Input Data" by Ludovica Pannitto and Aurélie Herbelot, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and it may mention specific datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Data and Language Modelling)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors describe their corpus, which consists of three parts:

1. **CHILDES Database**: This is a publicly available database of child-directed utterances, which is crucial for understanding language acquisition in children. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Brian MacWhinney. 2000. *The CHILDES Project: Tools for Analyzing Talk. Third Edition*. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.

2. **OpenSubtitles Corpus**: This dataset consists of movie and TV series subtitles filtered by content rating. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Pierre Lison and Jörg Tiedemann. 2016. *OpenSubtitles2016: Extracting Large Parallel Corpora from Movie and TV Subtitles*.

3. **Simple English Wikipedia**: This is a version of Wikipedia written in basic English, which serves as another source of child-directed language. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Wikipedia contributors. 2019. *Simple English Wikipedia*. Available at: https://simple.wikipedia.org/.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their specific characteristics, such as the type of data they contain and their relevance to the study.

Finally, I will compile the full citations for each dataset, ensuring that they are formatted correctly and ready for inclusion in any further documentation or analysis.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets used in this research paper effectively.
