To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comparison of Recent Waveform Generation and Acoustic Modeling Methods for Neural-Network-Based Speech Synthesis" by Xin Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction may give insights into the datasets used, especially if they are crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, as this section typically details the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors mention using a **Japanese speech corpus** consisting of neutral reading speech uttered by a female speaker. They specify that the corpus has a duration of 50 hours and includes 30,016 utterances, with 500 randomly selected for validation and another 500 for testing. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors refer to the Japanese speech corpus as follows:

- For the **Japanese speech corpus**, the citation is:
  > Hisashi Kawai, Tomoki Toda, Jinfu Ni, Minoru Tsuzaki, and Keiichi Tokuda. *XIMERA: A new TTS from ATR based on corpus-based technologies*. In Proceedings of the 5th ISCA Workshop on Speech Synthesis (SSW5), pages 179â€“184, 2004.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper, particularly in the context of the methods or evaluations discussed. However, based on the provided text, the primary dataset appears to be the Japanese speech corpus.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format for further processing or review.
