To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Action Classification and Highlighting in Videos" by Atousa Torabi and Leonid Sigal, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention using the **ActivityNet** dataset for their experiments, which indicates that this is a key dataset for their research. I will note this down as a primary dataset.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors provide more detailed information about the datasets used. In section 4.1, they describe the **ActivityNet** dataset in detail, including its characteristics such as the number of classes, average number of video samples per class, and the nature of the data (trimmed activities from longer videos). This confirms that **ActivityNet** is indeed the dataset they utilized for their experiments.

Additionally, I will check the **supplementary results** section where the authors mention using the **Hollywood2 (HOHA2)** dataset. They provide some context about this dataset, including the number of classes and samples, which further confirms its relevance to their research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. For the **ActivityNet** dataset, the citation is:
> F. Caba Heilbron, V. Escorcia, B. Ghanem, and J. Carlos Niebles. *ActivityNet: A large-scale video benchmark for human activity understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015.

For the **Hollywood2 (HOHA2)** dataset, the citation is:
> M. Marsza≈Çek, I. Laptev, and C. Schmid. *Actions in context*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details while extracting the datasets from the paper.
