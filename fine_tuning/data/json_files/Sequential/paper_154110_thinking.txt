To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WSRNET: Joint Spotting and Recognition of Handwritten Words" by George Retsinas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions that the proposed model is evaluated on the **IAM dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly mention using the **IAM dataset** for their numerical trials, which consists of 13,353 handwritten lines or 115,320 words written by 657 writers. This section provides valuable details about the dataset's composition and its significance in the context of the research.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the IAM dataset. The IAM dataset is widely recognized in the handwriting recognition community, and its citation is as follows:
> A. P. Giotis, G. Sﬁkas, B. Gatos, and C. Nikou. *A survey of document image word spotting techniques*. Pattern Recognition, 68:310 – 332, 2017.

Since the IAM dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that the dataset entry is clear and complete for any downstream processing or review.
