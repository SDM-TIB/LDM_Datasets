To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Visual Alignment Constraint for Continuous Sign Language Recognition" by Yuecong Min et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two challenging CSLR datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they state that they evaluated their method on the **PHOENIX14 dataset** and the **CSL dataset**. I will take note of the descriptions provided for each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

1. **PHOENIX14 Dataset**: The authors describe it as a widely used CSLR dataset recorded from German TV weather forecasts, containing 6,841 sentences with 1,295 different glosses. The dataset is split into training, development, and test sets.

2. **CSL Dataset**: This dataset is collected under laboratory conditions, consisting of 100 sign language sentences performed by 50 signers, resulting in 25,000 videos with over 100 hours of content. The authors mention that they followed a specific split for training and testing.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **PHOENIX14 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Koller, O., Forster, J., & Ney, H. (2015). Continuous sign language recognition: Towards large vocabulary statistical recognition systems handling multiple signers. *Computer Vision and Image Understanding*, 141, 108â€“125.

- For the **CSL dataset**, the citation is:
  > Huang, J., Zhou, W., Zhang, Q., Li, H., & Li, W. (2018). Video-based sign language recognition without temporal segmentation. In *Proceedings of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence*.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
