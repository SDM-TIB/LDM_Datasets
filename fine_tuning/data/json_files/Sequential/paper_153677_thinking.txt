To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gaussian Smoothen Semantic Features (GSSF) - Exploring the Linguistic Aspects of Visual Captioning in Indian Languages (Bengali) Using MSCOCO Framework" by Chiranjib Sur, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the challenges of image captioning in regional languages and mentions the use of existing datasets. I will pay attention to any specific datasets that are named.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the author describes the data acquisition process. Here, the author states that they used the **MSCOCO dataset** for training and validation. This is a crucial dataset for their experiments.

In the **results section**, the author provides statistics about the dataset used, confirming the use of the MSCOCO dataset and detailing the number of images and sentences associated with it.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MSCOCO dataset. The citation for the MSCOCO dataset is:

> Lin, T.-Y., Ma, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., & Doll√°r, P. (2014). Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) (pp. 740-755).

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **MSCOCO Dataset**: This dataset consists of 123,287 train+validation images and 566,747 train+validation sentences, with each image associated with at least five sentences.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
