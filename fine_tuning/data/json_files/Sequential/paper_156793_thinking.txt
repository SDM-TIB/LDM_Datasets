To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deformable Feature Alignment and Refinement for Moving Infrared Dim-small Target Detection" by Dengyan Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they state that they conducted experiments on two datasets: **DAUB** and **IRDST**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including the number of training and test video sequences and the total number of frames.

1. **DAUB Dataset**: The authors describe it as consisting of 10 training video sequences with a total of 8,982 frames and 7 test video sequences with a total of 4,795 frames.

2. **IRDST Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned to contain 42 training video sequences with a total of 20,398 frames and 43 test video sequences with a total of 20,258 frames.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The authors cite the datasets as follows:

- For the **DAUB dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hui, B., Song, Z., Fan, H., Zhong, P., Hu, W., Zhang, X., Lin, J., Su, H., Jin, W., Zhang, Y., et al. (2019). *A dataset for infrared image dim-small aircraft target detection and tracking under ground/air background*. Sci. Data Bank, 5(12), 4.

- For the **IRDST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sun, H., Bai, J., Yang, F., & Bai, X. (2023). *Receptive-field and direction induced attention network for infrared dim small target detection with a large-scale dataset IRDST*. IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 61, 1â€“13.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
