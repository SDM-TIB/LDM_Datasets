To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MODELLING THE COVID-19 VIRUS EVOLUTION WITH INCREMENTAL MACHINE LEARNING" by Andrés L. Suárez-Cetrulo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used data from "fifty countries with more COVID-19 cases reported," which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors describe their dataset in **section 3.1 (Dataset description)**. Here, they mention using the "COVID-19 Coronavirus data - daily (up to December 14th 2020)" available from the European Open Data Portal, which is crucial for my extraction.

I will note the details provided about the dataset, including its structure and the specific columns it contains, such as the number of positive cases, deaths, and other relevant information.

Now, I will ensure to retrieve the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors reference the dataset as being provided by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. I will look for the citation format used in the references section of the paper to ensure I capture it correctly.

The citation for the dataset is:
> European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. *COVID-19 Coronavirus data - daily (up to December 14th 2020)*. Available at: https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/covid-19-coronavirus-data-daily-up-to-14-december-2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details, including the name, description, and citation, ensuring that I follow the required format for clarity and consistency.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ready for any further processing or review.
