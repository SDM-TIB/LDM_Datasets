To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Investigating Linguistic Pattern Ordering in Hierarchical Natural Language Generation" by Shang-Yu Su and Yun-Nung Chen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction may reference datasets used in the context of existing research, while the experiments section is likely to detail the datasets employed in the study.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors mention using the **E2E NLG challenge dataset**, which is a crowd-sourced dataset of 50,000 instances in the restaurant domain. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized for the experiments.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the E2E NLG challenge dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **E2E NLG challenge dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jekaterina Novikova, Ondrej Dušek, and Verena Rieser. "The E2E dataset: New challenges for end-to-end generation." In Proceedings of SIGDIAL, 2017, pp. 201–206.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information regarding this dataset.

Now, I will summarize the findings and prepare to create an entry for the dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent work or analysis.
