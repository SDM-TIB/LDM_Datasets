To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OhioState at IJCNLP-2017 Task 4: Exploring Neural Architectures for Multilingual Customer Feedback Analysis" by Dushyanta Dhyani, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, task description, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments, but I need to look deeper for specific dataset details.

In **section 3 (Task Description)**, the authors mention that the contest organizers provided customer feedback data in four languages: English, French, Spanish, and Japanese. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find the specifics about their structure and size.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.1 (Dataset)**, where the paper outlines the size of train/dev/test samples for each language. The table included in this section provides the exact numbers of samples for each language, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Customer Feedback Dataset for English**: Contains 3066 training samples, 501 validation samples, and 501 test samples.
2. **Customer Feedback Dataset for Spanish**: Contains 1951 training samples, 401 validation samples, and 300 test samples.
3. **Customer Feedback Dataset for French**: Contains 1632 training samples, 302 validation samples, and 401 test samples.
4. **Customer Feedback Dataset for Japanese**: Contains 8176 training samples, 251 validation samples, and 301 test samples.

The authors also note that about 5% of the samples across the English, French, and Japanese tasks have multiple labels, while each sample in the Spanish task has only one label. This detail is important for understanding the dataset's labeling structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. However, since the datasets are provided by the contest organizers and not published in standalone papers, I will cite the shared task directly:

- For the **Customer Feedback Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dushyanta Dhyani. *OhioState at IJCNLP-2017 Task 4: Exploring Neural Architectures for Multilingual Customer Feedback Analysis*. In Proceedings of the IJCNLP 2017 Shared Task, 2017.

Since the datasets are part of a shared task, this citation will serve as the authoritative reference for the datasets used in the experiments.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
