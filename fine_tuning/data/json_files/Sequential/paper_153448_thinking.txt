To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Graph Embedding via LSTM History Tracking" by Shima Khoshraftar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on datasets from various domains, which indicates that datasets are indeed used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention three specific datasets:

1. **Radoslaw Dataset**: This dataset consists of email communications between employees of a company, containing 167 nodes and 89,000 edges over 39 time points.

2. **Ubuntu Dataset**: This dataset represents interactions on the Ask Ubuntu website, with 137,000 nodes, 280,000 edges, and 79 time steps.

3. **Contact Dataset**: This dataset is a network of human contacts with 274 nodes and 28,200 edges, divided into 39 graphs.

I will then verify the details of these datasets in the **references section** to ensure I have the correct citations. The authors reference the datasets as follows:

- For the **Radoslaw Dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. A. Rossi and N. K. Ahmed. "The network data repository with interactive graph analytics and visualization." In Proceedings of the Twenty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2015.

- For the **Ubuntu Dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. A. Rossi and N. K. Ahmed. "The network data repository with interactive graph analytics and visualization." In Proceedings of the Twenty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2015.

- For the **Contact Dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. A. Rossi and N. K. Ahmed. "The network data repository with interactive graph analytics and visualization." In Proceedings of the Twenty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2015.

Since all three datasets are cited from the same source, I will ensure to note that in my final output.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
