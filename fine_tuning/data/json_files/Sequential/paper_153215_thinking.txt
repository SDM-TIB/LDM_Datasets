To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Incremental Binarization on Recurrent Neural Networks for Single-Channel Source Separation" by Sunwoo Kim, Mrinmoy Maity, and Minje Kim, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction may give context about the datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, the authors mention that they randomly subsampled speakers from the **TIMIT corpus** for training and testing. They specify that 12 speakers were used for training and 4 for testing, along with details about the utterances and noise signals mixed with the clean signals.

I will note the specifics of the dataset:
- **TIMIT corpus**: This dataset is widely used for speech recognition and enhancement tasks. The authors mention that it includes recordings from 12 speakers for training and 4 for testing, with a total of 227,580 training examples and 81,770 test examples.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the TIMIT corpus. The TIMIT dataset is a well-known dataset, and its citation is typically included in literature related to speech processing.

The citation for the TIMIT corpus is:
> J. S. Garofolo, L. F. Lamel, W. M. Fisher, J. G. Fiscus, and D. S. Pallett. *TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus*. Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia, 1993.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the TIMIT corpus.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
