To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recurrent Back-Projection Network for Video Super-Resolution" by Muhammad Haris et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a new video super-resolution benchmark, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the context of their work. They mention the use of several datasets for evaluation, which is a strong indication that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

In the **experiments section**, particularly in **section 4.3 (Comparison with the state-of-the-arts)**, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Vid4 Dataset**: This dataset is noted for its limited ability to assess the relative merits of competing approaches due to visual artifacts and minimal inter-frame variation. The authors mention that it consists of only four video sequences.

2. **SPMCS Dataset**: This dataset is highlighted for exhibiting more variation but still lacks significant motion. The authors provide detailed results on this dataset, indicating its importance in their evaluation.

3. **Vimeo-90k Dataset**: This dataset is described as a larger and more diverse dataset with high-quality frames and a range of motion types. The authors stratify the Vimeo-90k sequences according to estimated motion velocities, which adds depth to their evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Vid4 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ce Liu and Deqing Sun. *A Bayesian approach to adaptive video super resolution*. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2011 IEEE Conference on, pages 209–216. IEEE, 2011.

- For **SPMCS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xin Tao, Hongyun Gao, Renjie Liao, Jue Wang, and Jiaya Jia. *Detail-revealing deep video super-resolution*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, Venice, Italy, pages 22–29, 2017.

- For **Vimeo-90k Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tianfan Xue, Baian Chen, Jiajun Wu, Donglai Wei, and William T Freeman. *Video enhancement with task-oriented flow*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.09078, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
