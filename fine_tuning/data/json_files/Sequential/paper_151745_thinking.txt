To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Context-Aware Sequence-to-Sequence Models for Conversational Systems" by Silje Christensen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their models using specific datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper. I will look for any explicit mentions of dataset names or descriptions.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and data preparation)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **UDC Dataset**: This dataset is based on Ubuntu Chat Logs and consists of 8.6 million turns built from 168.7 million words. It is described as a closed-domain dataset with unique characteristics, such as noisy responses and long turns.

2. **OpenSubtitles Dataset**: This dataset consists of conversations from movie manuscripts and contains 2.7 million sentences built from 19 million words. It is an open-domain dataset, which allows for a wide range of topics.

In this section, the authors also discuss the data preparation process, which includes reducing vocabulary size and handling out-of-vocabulary words, but my primary focus is on identifying the datasets themselves.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **UDC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > UDC Dataset. Ubuntu Chat Logs. Available at: https://irclogs.ubuntu.com.

- For the **OpenSubtitles Dataset**, the citation is:
  > OpenSubtitles Dataset. Available at: http://www.opensubtitles.org.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
