To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CS-TGN: Community Search via Temporal Graph Neural Networks" by Ali Behrouz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract highlights that the authors conducted experiments on "real-world temporal graphs with ground-truth communities," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that they evaluated their model using five real-world networks with ground-truth communities, and they provide a table (Table 1) that lists these datasets along with their statistics.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Football Dataset**: This dataset consists of 114 nodes and 613 edges, with 5 snapshots and 12 communities.
2. **Brain Dataset**: This dataset contains 190 nodes and 720 edges, with 4 snapshots and 15 communities.
3. **Email Dataset**: This dataset has 1005 nodes and 25.5K edges, with 6 snapshots and 42 communities.
4. **DBLP Dataset**: This dataset includes 472K nodes and 1M edges, with 8 snapshots and 5000 communities.
5. **YouTube Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1.1M nodes and 2.9M edges, with 4 snapshots and 5000 communities.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The authors reference several papers that likely provide the original datasets or describe them in detail. 

For the datasets, I will look for the following citations:

- For the **Football Dataset**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
