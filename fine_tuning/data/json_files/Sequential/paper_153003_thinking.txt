To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention-based Supply-Demand Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles" by Zikai Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the paper presents two prediction models based on historical data from a large-scale online car-hailing dataset. This indicates that there is at least one dataset involved, which I need to identify.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section** (Section IV). The authors state that they conducted experiments on a dataset collected from an online car-hailing company in China. They describe the dataset as containing taxi order data, trajectory data, and weather data for the city of Beijing. This is a significant finding, as it provides a clear indication of the dataset used for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide further details about the dataset:
- **Taxi Order Data**: Contains request start location, request end location, request start time, request end time, etc.
- **Taxi Trajectory Data**: Contains location, speed, and direction for every 2 seconds.
- **Weather Data**: Contains weather information such as rainy, sunny, cloudy for every 30 minutes.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is collected from an online car-hailing company and does not appear to have a formal citation like a published dataset, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset and provide a description instead.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:
1. **Online Car-Hailing Dataset**: This dataset includes taxi order data, trajectory data, and weather data collected from a car-hailing service in Beijing, China.

Since there is no formal citation for this dataset, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset without a specific reference.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly describe the dataset and its components, while also noting the lack of a formal citation.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify the mention of datasets.
2. Review the experiments section for detailed descriptions of the datasets used.
3. Note the proprietary nature of the dataset and summarize its components.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry based on the information gathered.
