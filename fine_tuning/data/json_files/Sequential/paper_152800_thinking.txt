To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GQA: A New Dataset for Real-World Visual Reasoning and Compositional Question Answering" by Drew A. Hudson and Christopher D. Manning, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the GQA dataset, indicating that it is a new dataset for visual reasoning and question answering, which suggests that it is the primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (The GQA Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they mention that GQA consists of **113K images and 22M questions**. This section will likely contain specific details about the dataset's structure, purpose, and how it was created.

In this section, the authors describe the dataset's components, including the **scene graphs** that represent the images, the diverse questions generated, and the semantic representations associated with each question. They also mention the balancing process that reduced the dataset to **1.7M balanced questions**. This indicates that the GQA dataset is the main focus, and I need to ensure I capture its full citation.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the GQA dataset. The authors reference the Visual Genome dataset, which is used as a foundation for GQA. The relevant citation for the Visual Genome dataset is:

- For **Visual Genome**:
  > Krishna, R., Zhu, Y., Groth, O., Johnson, J., Hata, K., Kravitz, J., Chen, S., Kalantidis, Y., Li, L.-J., Shamma, D. A., et al. (2017). *Visual Genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 123(1):32â€“73.

Since GQA is built upon the Visual Genome dataset, I will also include the citation for GQA itself, which is:

- For **GQA**:
  > Hudson, D. A., & Manning, C. D. (2019). *GQA: A New Dataset for Real-World Visual Reasoning and Compositional Question Answering*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.00730.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both the GQA dataset and the Visual Genome dataset, as they are both relevant to the research presented in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the study.
