To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modulating early visual processing by language" by Harm de Vries et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. In the introduction, the authors discuss the context of their work, which may include references to datasets relevant to visual question answering (VQA) tasks.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setting)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they mention two datasets:

1. **VQAv1 Dataset**: This dataset is explicitly described as containing 614,000 questions on 204,000 images, which is crucial for the visual question answering task.

2. **GuessWhat?! Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as comprising 822,000 binary question/answer pairs on 67,000 images, specifically designed for a cooperative two-player game involving visual object discovery.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For the **VQAv1 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Antol, A. Agrawal, J. Lu, M. Mitchell, D. Batra, Z. Lawrence, and D. Parikh. *VQA: Visual Question Answering*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015.

- For the **GuessWhat?! Dataset**, the citation is:
  > H. de Vries, F. Strub, S. Chandar, O. Pietquin, H. Larochelle, and A. Courville. *GuessWhat?! Visual Object Discovery through Multi-modal Dialogue*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited in any subsequent work or analysis.
