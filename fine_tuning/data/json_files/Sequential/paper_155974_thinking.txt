To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Bi-LSTM Autoencoder Framework for Anomaly Detection â€“ A Case Study of a Wind Power Dataset" by Ahmed Shoyeb Raihan and Imtiaz Ahmed, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study applies a framework to a "real-world multivariate time series dataset collected from a wind farm," which suggests that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of **30,997 data records** covering the entire year of **2015**, with data recorded as ten-minute averages. The dataset includes four environmental variables: average wind speed, standard deviation of wind speed, average wind direction, and temperature, with the target response being the wind power measured on the turbine.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the wind power dataset, as it appears to be a proprietary dataset collected from a wind farm. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is described but lacks a formal citation.

In summary, I will document the dataset as follows:

1. **Wind Power Dataset**: A multivariate time series dataset containing 30,997 records from a wind farm for the year 2015, with four features (average wind speed, standard deviation of wind speed, average wind direction, and temperature) and a target response (wind power).

Since there is no formal citation provided for the dataset, I will indicate that it is a proprietary dataset without a specific reference.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing.
