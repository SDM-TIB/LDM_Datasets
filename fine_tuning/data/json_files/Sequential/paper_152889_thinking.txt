To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gender Bias in Contextualized Word Embeddings" by Jieyu Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors analyze gender bias in ELMo's contextualized word vectors and mention the WinoBias probing corpus, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the implications of gender bias in word embeddings and mention the WinoBias dataset again. This reinforces its significance in their research.

In **section 4 (Bias in Coreference Resolution)**, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate a coreference resolution system using the **WinoBias dataset**. They describe it as a benchmark of paired male and female coreference resolution examples, which is crucial for understanding the gender bias in their experiments.

I will also check the **results section** where they summarize their findings on the WinoBias dataset, confirming its role in their analysis of gender bias.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the WinoBias dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Jieyu Zhao, Tianlu Wang, Mark Yatskar, Vicente Ordonez, and Kai-Wei Chang. *Gender bias in coreference resolution: Evaluation and debiasing methods*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 2 (Short Papers), pages 15-20, 2018.

Additionally, the authors mention the **OntoNotes dataset** in their methodology. I will also extract its citation from the references:
> Ralph Weischedel, Sameer Pradhan, Lance Ramshaw, Jeff Kaufman, Michelle Franchini, Mohammed El-Bachouti, Nianwen Xue, Martha Palmer, Jena D Hwang, Claire Bonial, et al. *Ontonotes release 5.0*.

Now, I have identified the two datasets of interest: **WinoBias** and **OntoNotes**. I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations for further processing.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **WinoBias Dataset**: A benchmark for evaluating gender bias in coreference resolution.
2. **OntoNotes Dataset**: A dataset used for training and evaluating coreference resolution systems.

I will now prepare the structured output for these datasets.
