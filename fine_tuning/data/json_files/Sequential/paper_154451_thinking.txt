To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Code Summarization with Structure-induced Transformer" by Hongqiu Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they state that their experiments are conducted on two benchmarks: **Java** and **Python**. This indicates that these programming languages serve as the basis for the datasets.

I will then look for any specific references to the datasets in the text. The authors mention that they follow the training, test, and development divisions from previous works, specifically citing Hu et al. (2018a) for the Java dataset and Wan et al. (2018) for the Python dataset. This suggests that the datasets are derived from these sources.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for the datasets:

1. For the **Java dataset**, the citation is:
   > Xing Hu, Ge Li, Xin Xia, David Lo, and Zhi Jin. *Deep code comment generation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/ACM 26th International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC), pages 200–20010, 2018.

2. For the **Python dataset**, the citation is:
   > Yao Wan, Zhou Zhao, Min Yang, Guandong Xu, Haochao Ying, Jian Wu, and Philip S Yu. *Improving automatic source code summarization via deep reinforcement learning*. In Proceedings of the 33rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, pages 397–407, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Java Dataset**: Used for code summarization tasks, following the training, test, and development divisions outlined by Hu et al. (2018a).
- **Python Dataset**: Used for code summarization tasks, following the training, test, and development divisions outlined by Wan et al. (2018).

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
