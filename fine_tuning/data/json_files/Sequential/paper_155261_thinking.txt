To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network for Financial Time Series" by Carmina FjellstrÃ¶m, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the use of an LSTM model for predicting stock price movements, which suggests that financial datasets are likely involved. The introduction elaborates on the challenges of financial time series analysis and mentions the application of LSTMs to the constituents of the Stockholm OMX30 index, indicating that this index is a key dataset.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Method)**, specifically the **3.1 Data** subsection, where the author describes the data used for the empirical investigation. Here, the paper states that daily closing prices for the constituents of the Stockholm OMX30 from May 2002 to January 2020 were downloaded. This is a clear identification of a dataset.

The paper also provides a table (Table 1) listing the top ten securities in the OMX30 index by weight, which further confirms the dataset's relevance. Additionally, the paper mentions that the daily returns were calculated based on these closing prices, reinforcing the importance of this dataset in the analysis.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset mentioned. The paper references the OMX30 index, which is a well-known financial index. I will search for the authoritative source or documentation for the OMX30 index to provide a proper citation.

The citation for the OMX30 index is:
> Nasdaq. *OMX Stockholm 30 Index, Fact Sheet*. 2020. Available at: https://indexes.nasdaq.com/docs/FS_OMXS30.pdf (Last accessed on 2020-02-11).

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the daily closing prices of the constituents of the OMX30 index, and the full citation for this dataset has been documented.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
