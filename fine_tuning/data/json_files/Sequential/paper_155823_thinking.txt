To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GreenEyes: An Air Quality Evaluating Model based on WaveNet" by Kan Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on their collected air quality data, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they collected. They mention that they placed four sensors in an office room at HKUST and collected around 220,000 data points over a period of approximately 61 hours. This section is crucial as it provides specifics about the dataset, including the number of sensors and the duration of data collection.

In **subsection 2.1 (Data Collection)**, the authors describe the setup and the data collection process, confirming that the dataset consists of air quality measurements from four sensors. This is a clear indication of the dataset's structure.

In **subsection 2.2 (IAQI Calculation)**, the authors explain how they calculated the Individual Air Quality Index (IAQI) based on the collected data. This further solidifies the dataset's relevance to air quality measurement.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if the authors refer to the dataset in the context of their experiments. They mention using the PM2.5 IAQI data from the sensors, which confirms that this dataset is utilized for their model evaluation.

Finally, I will look at the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, since the dataset is collected by the authors themselves, it may not have a formal citation like other datasets. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper.

The dataset I will extract is as follows:

1. **PM2.5 IAQI Dataset**: This dataset consists of air quality measurements collected from four sensors over a period of 61 hours, totaling around 220,000 data points. The data is used to predict the IAQI levels based on the PM2.5 concentrations.

Since the dataset is original and created by the authors, I will cite it as follows:
> Kan Huang, Kai Zhang, and Ming Liu. 2018. GreenEyes: An Air Quality Evaluating Model based on WaveNet. In Proceedings of the conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 8 pages. https://doi.org/XXXXXXX.XXXXXXX

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
