To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Context-LSTM: a robust classifier for video detection on UCF101" by Dengshan Li and Rujing Wang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved competitive detection accuracy on the **UCF101 dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the UCF101 dataset. They mention that it is a human action video dataset containing 101 action categories and a total of 13,320 videos, with each video lasting from a few seconds to over ten seconds. This section confirms that UCF101 is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors discuss how they utilized the UCF101 dataset for training and testing their proposed Context-LSTM model. They mention splitting the dataset into training and test sets, which further emphasizes its importance in their research.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the UCF101 dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Khurram Soomro, Amir Roshan Zamir, and Mubarak Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction process:

1. Identify the dataset mentioned in the abstract and introduction.
2. Confirm the dataset details in the materials and methods section, specifically in the dataset description.
3. Validate the dataset's usage in the experiments section.
4. Retrieve the full citation from the references.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the citation is included for proper attribution.
