To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Time-causal and time-recursive spatio-temporal receptive fields" by Tony Lindeberg, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a summary of the key contributions and may mention datasets used for experiments. In the introduction, the author may discuss the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. I will pay attention to any specific names of datasets mentioned, as well as any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the purpose of each dataset in the context of the research.

If the paper includes a **results or discussion section**, I will check there as well, as authors sometimes refer to datasets when discussing their findings or comparing their results to previous work.

Once I identify the datasets, I will then consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and any other relevant details for each dataset.

For example, if I find that the paper uses the "Penn Action Dataset," I will note the citation as follows:
- **Penn Action Dataset**: 
  > Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the information is presented clearly and accurately.
