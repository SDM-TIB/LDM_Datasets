To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Flight Trajectory Prediction Using an Enhanced CNN-LSTM Network" by Qinzhi Hao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of flight trajectory data for prediction, which suggests that there is a dataset involved. The introduction further elaborates on the importance of accurate flight trajectory prediction, hinting at the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **section titled "Introduction to the Dataset"**. Here, the authors describe how they performed air combat simulations on the DCS World platform to record flight data, including various parameters such as altitude, speed, and angles. This section is crucial as it provides details about the dataset used in their experiments.

The authors mention that the recorded data were exported in CSV format after being processed through the tacview software. They also state that the data was low-pass filtered and divided into a training set and a test set in a 4:1 ratio. This indicates that the dataset is derived from a simulation environment, which is important for understanding its context.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DCS World platform, which is the source of the dataset. The citation for the DCS World platform is not explicitly provided in the paper, so I will need to look for it in external sources or databases to ensure I have the correct reference.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including the name, description, and citation, into a structured format. The dataset I will include is:

1. **DCS World Flight Data**: This dataset consists of flight trajectory data recorded during air combat simulations, capturing various parameters such as altitude, speed, and angles. The data is processed and exported in CSV format for analysis.

The citation for the DCS World platform is:
> Eagle Dynamics. *DCS World*. [Online]. Available: https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/downloads/world/

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the dataset's details and citation, ready for any further processing or review.
