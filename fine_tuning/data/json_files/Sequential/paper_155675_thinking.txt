To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Facial Landmark Predictions with Applications to Metaverse" by Qiao Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used the **LJ Speech 1.1 dataset** for pre-training and **LRS 3 dataset** for training their model, which suggests that these datasets are significant for their research.

Next, I will look into **section IV (Experiments and Results)**, particularly **subsection A (Data Preparation)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. Here, they mention using a small subset of the **Lip Reading Sentences 3 (LRS 3)** dataset, which is compiled from TED talks on YouTube. This section confirms the use of LRS 3 and provides context about how the data was prepared.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **LJ Speech 1.1 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ito, K., & Johnson, L. (2017). The LJ speech dataset. Retrieved from https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/

2. For the **LRS 3 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Afouras, T., Chung, J. S., & Zisserman, A. (2018). LRS3-TED: A large-scale dataset for visual speech recognition. arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.00496.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are ready for review or further processing, maintaining clarity and accuracy in the representation of the datasets used in the research.
