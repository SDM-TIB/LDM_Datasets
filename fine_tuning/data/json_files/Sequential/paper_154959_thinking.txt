To extract datasets from the research paper titled "S&P 500 Stock Price Prediction Using Technical, Fundamental and Text Data" by Shan Zhong and David B. Hitchcock, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the study uses data containing weekly historical prices, finance reports, and text information from news items associated with 518 different common stocks issued by current and former S&P 500 large-cap companies. This indicates that there are multiple datasets involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional details about the datasets. The introduction mentions the integration of various predictive models and data types, but does not specify dataset names. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

I will then focus on the **Data Selection and Preprocessing** section, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used. Here, I find that the authors collected stock price data from two sources: **Yahoo Finance** and **Alpha Vantage**. They mention that the dataset includes 518 stocks and spans from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2019.

In the **Technical Indicators and Finance Report Data** subsection, the authors describe the technical indicators and financial report variables used in their model, but they do not introduce new datasets here. Instead, they elaborate on how these indicators are derived from the stock price data.

The **Text News Data** subsection reveals that the authors utilized the **New York Times (NYT) API** to collect text data, which includes 3.2 million articles from January 2000 to December 2019. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

Next, I will check the **References** section to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **Yahoo Finance**:
   > Yahoo! Finance. Yahoo! https://finance.yahoo.com/, 2021.

2. **Alpha Vantage**:
   > Alpha Vantage. Alpha Vantage Inc. https://www.alphavantage.co/, 2021.

3. **New York Times API**:
   > New York Times. New York Times Company. https://www.nytimes.com/, 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their sources, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- Historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance and Alpha Vantage for 518 S&P 500 stocks from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2019.
- Text data from the New York Times API, including 3.2 million articles from January 2000 to December 2019.

I will now prepare to format this information according to the required structure for further processing.
