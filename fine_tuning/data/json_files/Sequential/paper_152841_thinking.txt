To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Evaluation of Adversarial Perturbations for Sequence-to-Sequence Models" by Paul Michel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses adversarial examples in the context of sequence-to-sequence models but does not specify any datasets. The introduction mentions the IWSLT2016 dataset as the basis for their experiments, which is a crucial piece of information.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly state that they perform experiments on the **IWSLT2016 dataset** for machine translation tasks in the language pairs {French, German, Czech} → English. This section provides details about the dataset's structure, including the number of training, validation, and test samples for each language pair.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the IWSLT2016 dataset. The citation for the IWSLT2016 dataset is:

- **IWSLT2016 Dataset**: 
  > Mauro Cettolo, Jan Niehues, Sebastian Stüker, Luisa Bentivogli, Roldano Cattoni, and Marcello Federico. *The IWSLT 2016 Evaluation Campaign*. In Proceedings of the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation, 2016.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **IWSLT2016 Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating machine translation models and includes various language pairs, specifically {French, German, Czech} → English. The dataset statistics indicate the number of training, validation, and test samples for each language pair.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included as it is critical for proper attribution.
