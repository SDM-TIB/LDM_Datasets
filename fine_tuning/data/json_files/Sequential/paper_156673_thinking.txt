To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Physics-based deep learning reveals rising heating demand heightens air pollution in Norwegian cities" by Cong Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets used in the study.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study utilizes **ten years (2009-2018) of daily traffic, weather, and air pollution data from three major cities in Norway**. This suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly **section 3 (Data and methods)**, where the authors describe the data sources in detail. Here, they mention three main sources of data:

1. **Air Pollution Data**: This data is sourced from the **Norwegian Institute for Air Research (NILU)**, which includes daily measurements of PM2.5 and NOx at the monitoring station level.

2. **Traffic Data**: The traffic volume data is obtained from the **Norwegian Public Road Administration (SVV)**, which provides daily counts of motor vehicles passing through monitored traffic stops.

3. **Weather Data**: Daily weather measurements are sourced from the **Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET)**, including various meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the implications of these datasets on air pollution predictions, confirming their relevance to the study's findings.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** for these datasets in the **references section**. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Norwegian Institute for Air Research (NILU)**, the citation is:
  > NILU. (n.d.). *Norwegian Institute for Air Research*. Retrieved from [NILU website](https://www.nilu.no)

- For the **Norwegian Public Road Administration (SVV)**, the citation is:
  > Norwegian Public Road Administration. (n.d.). *Traffic data*. Retrieved from [SVV website](https://www.vegvesen.no)

- For the **Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET)**, the citation is:
  > Norwegian Meteorological Institute. (n.d.). *Weather data*. Retrieved from [MET website](https://www.met.no)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the key details and citations for each dataset used in the research paper. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced accurately in future work.
