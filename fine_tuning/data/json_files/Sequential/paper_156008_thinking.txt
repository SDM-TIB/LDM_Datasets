To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ArmanTTS: A Single-Speaker Persian Dataset for Text-to-Speech" by Mohammd Hasan Shamgholi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract introduces the ArmanTTS dataset, indicating that it is a single-speaker dataset for Persian text-to-speech conversion. This suggests that the dataset is central to the paper, and I should look for detailed descriptions of it.

Next, I will examine the **related work** section to identify any other datasets that the authors compare ArmanTTS against. The authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **LibriTTS**: A multi-speaker English dataset derived from the LibriSpeech corpus, containing 582 hours of speech and 2456 speakers.
2. **LJSpeech**: A single-speaker English dataset derived from LibriVox books, containing about 24 hours of speech.
3. **HiFi-TTS**: A high-quality English dataset with 292 hours of speech and 10 speakers.
4. **HUI-Audio-Corpus-German**: A high-quality German dataset with 122 speakers and 326 hours of speech.
5. **Blizzard-2013**: A dataset with about 319 hours of single-speaker speech in Indian.
6. **M-AILABS**: A dataset for converting from speech to text, containing 75 hours of speech.
7. **Persian-text-to-speech**: The only available dataset in Persian, containing 30 hours of single-speaker speech.

In the **dataset structure** section, the authors provide detailed characteristics of the ArmanTTS dataset, including its sample rate, audio duration, and the number of samples. This section confirms that ArmanTTS is the primary dataset of focus.

Now, I will look at the **references** section to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations I need to extract include:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, along with their respective details and citations.
