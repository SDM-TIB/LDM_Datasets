To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Improving Deep Learning Trace Analysis with System Call Arguments" by Quentin Fournier et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data collection sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on a **novel web request dataset** and validating their approach on a **second dataset collected on pre-production servers by Ciena**. This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **data collection section (Section IV)**, where the authors provide more details about the datasets. They describe the first dataset as comprising **around 250,000 web requests**, which they generated using a client-server framework. They also mention that the actual dataset is publicly available on GitHub and Zenodo, which is crucial for citation purposes.

The second dataset is described as being collected on **pre-production servers by Ciena**, but the authors do not provide specific details about this dataset in the same section. However, they refer to it as a validation dataset, which is important for understanding its context.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors provide links to the GitHub repository and Zenodo for the web request dataset, which I will include in the citation. However, since the second dataset does not have a specific citation provided in the paper, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset collected by Ciena.

Here are the citations I will compile:

1. **Web Request Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Quentin Fournier, Daniel Aloise, Seyed Vahid Azhari, and FranÃ§ois Tetreault. *On Improving Deep Learning Trace Analysis with System Call Arguments*. Available at: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/qfournier/syscall_args) and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/4091287#.X4hhGNjpNQI).

2. **Ciena Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Ciena. *Dataset collected on pre-production servers*. (No specific citation available; proprietary dataset).

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its full citation. This will facilitate further analysis or use of the datasets in future research.
