To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Human Eye Fixations via an LSTM-based Saliency Attentive Model" by Marcella Cornia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on public saliency prediction datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section IV), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and testing their model. Here, they explicitly mention four datasets:

1. **SALI-CON**: The largest dataset for saliency prediction, containing 10,000 training images, 5,000 validation images, and 5,000 testing images sourced from the Microsoft COCO dataset. The authors note that eye fixations are simulated with mouse movements.

2. **MIT1003**: This dataset consists of 1,003 images from Flickr and LabelMe, with saliency maps created from eye-tracking data of 15 observers.

3. **MIT300**: A collection of 300 natural images with saliency maps generated from eye-tracking data of 39 users. The authors mention that saliency maps for this dataset are held out for evaluation.

4. **CAT2000**: This dataset contains 4,000 images across 20 categories, with saliency maps for the testing set not publicly available.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **SALICON**:
  > Jiang, M., Huang, S., Duan, J., & Zhao, Q. (2015). SALICON: Saliency in context. In *IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition*.

- For **MIT1003**:
  > Judd, T., Durand, F., & Torralba, A. (2012). A benchmark of computational models of saliency to predict human fixations. *MIT Technical Report*.

- For **MIT300**:

- For **CAT2000**:
  > Borji, A., & Itti, L. (2015). CAT2000: A Large Scale Fixation Dataset for Boosting Saliency Research. In *IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
