To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Workflow Discovery from Dialogues in the Low Data Regime" by Amine El Hattami et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors present experiments using the **Action-Based Conversations Dataset (ABCD)**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology. In section 5.2, they provide a detailed description of the **ABCD dataset**, noting that it contains over 10,000 human-to-human dialogues split into training, validation, and test sets. They also mention the **MultiWOZ dataset**, which is used for cross-domain evaluation.

In section 5.2, the authors provide specific details about both datasets:

1. **Action-Based Conversations Dataset (ABCD)**: This dataset consists of over 10,000 dialogues across 30 domains, with 231 associated slots and 55 unique user intents. The authors explain how they adapted this dataset for their workflow discovery task.

2. **MultiWOZ Dataset**: This dataset contains over 10,000 dialogues across eight domains, and the authors explain how they utilized it for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **ABCD dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chen, D., Chen, H., Yang, Y., Lin, A., & Yu, Z. (2021). Action-based conversations dataset: A corpus for building more in-depth task-oriented dialogue systems. In Proceedings of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL).

- For the **MultiWOZ dataset**, the citation is:
  > Budzianowski, P., Wen, T.-H., Tseng, B.-H., Casanueva, I., Ultes, S., Ramadan, O., & Gašić, M. (2018). MultiWOZ–a large-scale multi-domain wizard-of-oz dataset for task-oriented dialogue modelling. In Proceedings of the Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper.
