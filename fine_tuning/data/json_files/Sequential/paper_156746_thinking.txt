To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "PLDNet: PLD-Guided Lightweight Deep Network Boosted by Efficient Attention for Handheld Dual-Microphone Speech Enhancement" by Nan Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a general overview of the research but does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **experiments section** for detailed information.

In **section 3 (Experiments)**, the authors mention using three datasets for their experimental analysis:

1. **VCTK Dataset**: This dataset is used for source speakers, and the authors specify that they use 99 speakers for training, 5 for validation, and 5 for testing.

2. **LibriSpeech Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for interference speakers, with the authors indicating that they use the train-clean-100, dev-clean, and test-clean subsets for training, validation, and testing, respectively.

3. **WHAM! Dataset**: This dataset is employed for noise signals, and the authors mention using 58 hours for training, 10 hours for validation, and 9 hours for testing.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **VCTK Dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. Veaux, J. Yamagishi, K. MacDonald et al., “CSTR VCTK Corpus: English multi-speaker corpus for CSTR voice cloning toolkit,” University of Edinburgh. The Centre for Speech Technology Research (CSTR), 2017.

- For **LibriSpeech Dataset**, the citation is:
  > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur, “LibriSpeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books,” in 2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 5206–5210, 2015.

- For **WHAM! Dataset**, the citation is:
  > G. Wichern, J. Antognini, M. Flynn, L. R. Zhu, E. McQuinn, D. Crow, E. Manilow, and J. L. Roux, “WHAM!: Extending speech separation to noisy environments,” arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.01160, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details about the datasets are captured accurately.
