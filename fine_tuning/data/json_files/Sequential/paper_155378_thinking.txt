To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Speech Emotion Recognition with Co-Attention Based Multi-Level Acoustic Information" by Heqing Zou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on the **IEMOCAP dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the IEMOCAP dataset. They mention that it is a widely used emotion recognition dataset recorded from ten different actors, containing audio, video, transcriptions, and motion-capture information. They also specify that they consider 5531 acoustic utterances from four emotions: angry, sad, happy, and neutral.

To confirm the dataset's relevance, I will check the **experiments section** where the authors discuss their validation strategies and performance metrics, further emphasizing the use of the IEMOCAP dataset.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the IEMOCAP dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For **IEMOCAP dataset**:
  > C. Busso, M. Bulut, C.-C. Lee, A. Kazemzadeh, E. Mower, S. Kim, J. N. Chang, S. Lee, and S. S. Narayanan. *IEMOCAP: Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture Database*. Language Resources and Evaluation, vol. 42, no. 4, pp. 335â€“359, 2008.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the IEMOCAP dataset, I will create an entry for it, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
