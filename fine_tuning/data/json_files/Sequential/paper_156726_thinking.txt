To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transformer Meets Gated Residual Networks To Enhance Photoplethysmogram Artifact Detection Informed by Mutual Information Neural Estimation" by Thanh-Dung Le et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but I need to look for specific dataset names or descriptions in the subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the establishment of a high-resolution research database (HRDB) at the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) at CHU Sainte-Justine. This indicates that a dataset is being utilized, but I need to find more details.

Moving to the **materials and methods section**, I will look for a detailed description of the dataset. The authors describe the CHUSJ-PICU's HRDB, which integrates various biomedical signals, including photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals and blood pressure measurements. They specify that the dataset includes recordings from 1,573 patients, with continuous 96-hour recordings of ECG, PPG, and blood pressure collected every 5 seconds. This section provides crucial information about the dataset's structure and content.

Next, I will check the **experimental results section** to see if the authors reference the dataset again or provide any additional context about its use in their experiments. They discuss the performance of their models on the dataset, confirming its relevance to their findings.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference previous works that describe the HRDB and its implementation in the PICU. I will extract the relevant citations that pertain to the dataset.

The full citation for the HRDB is:
> D. Brossier, R. El Taani, M. Sauthier, N. Roumeliotis, G. Emeriaud, and P. Jouvet. "Creating a high-frequency electronic database in the picu: the perpetual patient," *Pediatr. Crit. Care Med.*, vol. 19, no. 4, pp. e189â€“e198, 2018.

Additionally, I will note that the authors also reference other studies that may have contributed to the dataset's development or use, but the primary citation for the HRDB is the most relevant.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including its name, description, and citation, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness. This will allow for a structured presentation of the dataset extracted from the paper.
