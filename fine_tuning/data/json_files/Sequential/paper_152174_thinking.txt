To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "Ask Me Even More: Dynamic Memory Tensor Networks (Extended Model)" by Govardana Sachithanandam Ramachandran and Ajay Sohmshetty, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **1K bAbI dataset**, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Datasets)**, where the authors specifically mention the **Facebook’s bAbI Dataset**. They describe it as comprising 20 different reading comprehension tasks, with 1,000 training examples for each task. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's purpose and structure.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm that the authors used the **bAbI dataset** for their experiments. In section 5.2, they mention that they weakly trained their model on the **1K bAbI dataset**, which confirms its use in their research.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citation for the **bAbI dataset**. The relevant citation is:

- For **Facebook’s bAbI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Weston, Jason, et al. "Towards ai-complete question answering: A set of prerequisite toy tasks." arXiv preprint arXiv:1502.05698 (2015).

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
