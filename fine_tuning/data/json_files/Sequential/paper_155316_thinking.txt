To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards deep learning-powered IVF: A large public benchmark for morphokinetic parameter prediction" by T. Gomez et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors describe a fully annotated dataset of 704 videos of developing embryos, which is a strong indication that this is the primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further context about the dataset. The introduction discusses the need for a public reference benchmark for training and evaluating deep learning models in IVF, reinforcing the importance of the dataset mentioned in the abstract.

In the **Methods section**, particularly **section 2.1 (Dataset collection)**, the authors provide detailed information about how the dataset was collected. They mention that the dataset consists of 704 videos of embryos, which were selected based on specific criteria, and that the videos were monitored using a time-lapse imaging system. This section confirms the dataset's characteristics and its significance for the study.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **Results** or **Discussion** sections. However, the focus remains on the primary dataset of 704 videos, which is extensively described throughout the paper.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors do not provide a separate citation for the dataset itself, but they do reference the time-lapse imaging system used (Vitrolife©) and the approval from the Local Institutional Review Board (GNEDS). Since the dataset is a product of their research, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> T. Gomez, M. Feyeux, J. Boulant, N. Normand, L. David, P. Paul-Gilloteaux, T. Fréour, and H. Mouchère. *Towards deep learning-powered IVF: A large public benchmark for morphokinetic parameter prediction*. May 16, 2022.

In summary, the primary dataset extracted from the paper is the fully annotated dataset of 704 videos of developing embryos, and the citation for this dataset is the paper itself. I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
