To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Micro-level Reserving for General Insurance Claims using a Long Short-Term Memory Network" by Ihsan Chaoubi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors illustrate their estimation procedure on both a simulated and a real general insurance dataset, which suggests that there are at least two datasets to consider.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically sections 3 and 4) where the authors describe their case studies. In section 3, they mention using a **simulated dataset** containing 998,807 claims with various features, which is crucial for understanding their model's performance. In section 4, they discuss a **real dataset** from a Canadian insurance company, which includes 53,677 claimants associated with 41,916 distinct claims.

Now, I will gather detailed descriptions of each dataset:

1. **Simulated Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as containing 998,807 claims with occurrence dates between 1994 and 2005. It includes static characteristics such as accident year, reporting delay, and claimant age, as well as dynamic information like incremental payments.

2. **Real Dataset**: This dataset pertains to auto insurance policies and contains bodily injury claims from January 1, 2006, to August 31, 2010. It includes various static features (e.g., claimant age, vehicle type) and dynamic features (e.g., incremental monthly payment).

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from the authors' simulations and a proprietary dataset from an insurance company, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper.

For the **simulated dataset**, I will cite the relevant paper that describes the simulation method:
- Gabrielli, A., & WÃ¼thrich, M. (2018). An individual claims history simulation machine. *Risks*, 6(29).

For the **real dataset**, since it is proprietary and not publicly available, I will note that it is provided by a Canadian insurance company without a formal citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include all relevant details and citations for future reference.
