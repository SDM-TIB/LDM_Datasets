To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Selective Attention LSTM for Well Log Curve Synthesis" by Yuankai Zhou and Huanyu Li, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of a machine learning method validated through field experiments, which suggests that there may be datasets involved, particularly related to well logging data.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 3) in detail, as this is where datasets are typically described. The authors mention using "uranium mine logging data from the Nalinggou area in the northeastern Ordos Basin." This indicates that there is a specific dataset being utilized for their experiments.

In Section 3.1 (Setup), the authors specify that they selected data from 20 wells, with 15 used for training and 5 for testing. They also mention the logging parameters used in the experiments, including resistivity, density, natural gamma, and well diameter. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference several studies that may provide additional context or data sources related to well logging. However, the primary dataset appears to be the uranium mine logging data from the Nalinggou area.

The citation for the dataset can be constructed based on the information provided in the paper. Since the authors do not provide a specific dataset citation, I will reference the paper itself as the source of the dataset:

- For the uranium mine logging data, the citation is:
  > Zhou, Y., & Li, H. (2023). Efficient Selective Attention LSTM for Well Log Curve Synthesis. *[Journal Name]*, [Volume(Issue)], [Page Range]. 

I will replace *[Journal Name]*, [Volume(Issue)], and [Page Range] with the appropriate details once they are available.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is critical for proper attribution and future reference. This will allow for a clear understanding of the datasets used in the research and their relevance to the study's findings.
