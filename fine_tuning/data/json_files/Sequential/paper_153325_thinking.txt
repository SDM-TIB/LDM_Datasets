To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Two Birds, One Stone: A Simple, Unified Model for Text Generation from Structured and Unstructured Data" by Hamidreza Shahidi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions two tasks: neural table-to-text generation and neural question generation (NQG), which suggests that datasets related to these tasks will be discussed.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe:

1. **WIKIBIO Dataset**: This dataset is used for the neural table-to-text generation task. It consists of 728,321 articles from English Wikipedia, with the first sentence of each article serving as the ground-truth description for the corresponding infobox. The dataset is divided into training (80%), validation (10%), and test (10%) sets.

2. **SQuAD Dataset v1.1**: This dataset is utilized for the NQG task and contains 536 Wikipedia articles with over 100,000 question-answer pairs. The authors note that the test set of the original dataset is not publicly available, and they refer to two different splits of the dataset for their experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **WIKIBIO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Rémi Lebret, David Grangier, and Michael Auli. *Neural text generation from structured data with application to the biography domain*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1203–1213, 2016.

- For the **SQuAD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2383–2392, 2016.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
