To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Examining the Ordering of Rhetorical Strategies in Persuasive Requests" by Omar Shaikh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the study. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, so I will pay close attention to any references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (Method)**, specifically the **2.1 Dataset** subsection, where the authors describe their dataset in detail. Here, they mention the **Borrow dataset**, which consists of 49,855 loan requests scraped from the r/Borrow subreddit. This section will provide essential details about the dataset, including its size, content, and the nature of the data collected.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference a previous work by Yang et al. (2019) that adapted the labeling definitions for persuasive strategies. Therefore, I will need to include this citation as it pertains to the dataset's annotation process.

The citation for the **Borrow dataset** is as follows:
> Diyi Yang, Jiaao Chen, Zichao Yang, Dan Jurafsky, and Eduard Hovy. *Let’s make your request more persuasive: Modeling persuasive strategies via semi-supervised neural nets on crowdfunding platforms*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pages 3620–3630, Minneapolis, Minnesota. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details, including the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that each entry is clearly articulated and accurately referenced.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for any further processing or review.
