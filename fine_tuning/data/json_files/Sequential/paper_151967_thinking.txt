To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-label Image Recognition by Recurrently Discovering Attentional Regions" by Zhouxia Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on large-scale benchmarks for multi-label image classification, specifically citing **MS-COCO** and **PASCAL VOC 07**. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 5) to find detailed descriptions of how these datasets were used. In this section, the authors explicitly mention that they conducted experiments on **PASCAL VOC 2007** and **Microsoft COCO** datasets, providing performance metrics and comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods.

Now, I will gather specific details about each dataset:

1. **PASCAL VOC 2007**: The paper states that this dataset contains 9,963 images across 20 object categories, which are divided into training, validation, and test sets. The authors report their model's performance on this dataset, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 91.9%.

2. **Microsoft COCO**: The authors mention that this dataset consists of 82,081 training images and 40,137 validation images, covering 80 common object categories. They report their model's performance on the validation set, achieving significant improvements over previous methods.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **PASCAL VOC 2007**, the citation is:
  > M. Everingham, L. Van Gool, C. K. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2):303–338, 2010.

- For **Microsoft COCO**, the citation is:
  > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755. Springer, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research along with their proper citations.
