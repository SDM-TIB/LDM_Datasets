To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Wider and Deeper, Cheaper and Faster: Tensorized LSTMs for Sequence Learning" by Zhen He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on "five challenging sequence learning tasks," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the tasks they evaluated their model on. I will look for specific mentions of datasets used for each task. 

1. **Wikipedia Language Modeling**: The authors mention using the **Hutter Prize Wikipedia dataset**, which consists of 100 million characters from various sources. This dataset is explicitly named and described in terms of its content and purpose.

2. **Algorithmic Tasks**: The paper describes two tasks: 
   - **Addition**: The authors do not specify a dataset name but describe the task setup.
   - **Memorization**: Similar to the addition task, this is described without a specific dataset name.

3. **MNIST Image Classification**: The authors refer to the **MNIST dataset**, which is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit classification. They provide details about the dataset's structure and the tasks performed on it.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations to ensure proper attribution. 

- For the **Hutter Prize Wikipedia dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marcus Hutter. *The human knowledge compression contest*. URL http://prize.hutter1.net, 2012.

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

Since the algorithmic tasks do not have specific datasets associated with them, I will note that they are based on synthetic data generated for the tasks.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each identified dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
