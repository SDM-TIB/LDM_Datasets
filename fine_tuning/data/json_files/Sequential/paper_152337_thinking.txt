To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Hierarchical Deep Temporal Model for Group Activity Recognition" by Mostafa S. Ibrahim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on two datasets: the **Collective Activity Dataset** and a **new volleyball dataset**. This is a strong indication that I need to gather more details about these datasets.

Next, I will look into the **Datasets** section, which is likely to provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the authors mention:

1. **Collective Activity Dataset**: This dataset consists of 44 videos with person-level action labels and group-level activities. It is widely used for evaluating group activity recognition approaches.

2. **Volleyball Dataset**: This is a new dataset created by the authors, consisting of 1525 frames annotated with player action labels and team activity labels, collected from publicly available YouTube volleyball videos.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citation for the **Collective Activity Dataset** is attributed to the work by Choi et al. (2009), which is as follows:
> W. Choi, K. Shahid, and S. Savarese. *What are they doing?: Collective activity classification using spatio-temporal relationship among people*. In Computer Vision Workshops (ICCV Workshops), 2009 IEEE 12th International Conference on, pages 1282â€“1289, IEEE, 2009.

For the **Volleyball Dataset**, since it is a new dataset introduced by the authors, I will cite it as follows:
> Mostafa S. Ibrahim, Srikanth Muralidharan, Zhiwei Deng, Arash Vahdat, and Greg Mori. *A Hierarchical Deep Temporal Model for Group Activity Recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2023. (Note: The exact citation format may vary based on the conference proceedings.)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
