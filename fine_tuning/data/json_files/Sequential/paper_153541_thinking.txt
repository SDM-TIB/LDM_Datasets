To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SpineNet: Learning Scale-Permuted Backbone for Recognition and Localization" by Xianzhi Du et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on the **COCO dataset** and **ImageNet**. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments in **section 5 (Experiments)**. Here, they explicitly mention using the **COCO dataset** for object detection and the **ImageNet ILSVRC-2012** dataset for image classification. They also refer to the **iNaturalist-2017** dataset, which is used for fine-grained classification tasks.

Now, I will gather the details for each dataset mentioned:

1. **COCO Dataset**: The authors state that they evaluate their models on the COCO dataset, which is a well-known benchmark for object detection tasks.

2. **ImageNet ILSVRC-2012**: This dataset is commonly used for image classification tasks and is referenced in the context of evaluating the performance of their models.

3. **iNaturalist-2017**: This dataset is specifically mentioned for fine-grained classification tasks, indicating its relevance in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **COCO dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr DollÃ¡r, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

- For the **ImageNet ILSVRC-2012**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 2015.

- For the **iNaturalist-2017 dataset**, the citation is:

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
