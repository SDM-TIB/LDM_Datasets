To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Conditional Splitting Framework for Efficient Constituency Parsing" by Thanh-Tung Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions and results of the paper, which may include references to datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details about their contents or characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **Penn Treebank (PTB)** for syntactic parsing and the **RST Discourse Treebank (RST-DT)** for discourse parsing. I will note these datasets and gather any additional information provided about them in the text.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For the **Penn Treebank**, the citation is:
> Marcus, M. P., Marcinkiewicz, M. A., & Santorini, B. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313-330.

For the **RST Discourse Treebank**, the citation is:
> Carlson, L., Marcu, D., & Okurowski, M. (2002). RST Discourse Treebank (RST-DT) LDC2002T07. Linguistic Data Consortium.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for future reference.
