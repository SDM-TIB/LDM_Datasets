To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Intent Classification in Question-Answering Using LSTM Architectures" by Giovanni Di Gennaro et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses intent classification in question-answering, but does not specify any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the problem but still lacks specific dataset references.

Next, I will focus on the **implementation section**, particularly **section 3.2 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for training and testing their models. Here, they mention a heterogeneous dataset consisting of questions both manually constructed and published by TREC and USC. This dataset contains 5,500 training questions and 500 test questions, classified into a two-level hierarchy.

The authors provide a detailed description of the dataset, including the number of questions and the classification structure, which is crucial for understanding its application in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as being published by TREC and USC, but they do not provide a specific citation for it in the references. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is derived from these sources, but I will need to look up the original publications or datasets from TREC and USC to provide accurate citations.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: TREC and USC Question Dataset
   - **Description**: A heterogeneous dataset consisting of 5,500 training questions and 500 test questions, classified into a two-level hierarchy with 50 different labels.
   - **Citation**: Since the authors do not provide a specific citation, I will note that the dataset is based on works from TREC and USC, and I will need to find the appropriate references for these sources.

Finally, I will ensure that I have all the necessary details to create a structured output for the dataset, ready for further processing or review.
