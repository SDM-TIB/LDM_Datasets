To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Video Inpainting Detection" by Peng Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on video inpainting detection, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using the **DAVIS 2016 Dataset** and the **Free-form Video Inpainting Dataset**. I will take note of these datasets and look for more details about them.

In the paper, the authors describe the **DAVIS 2016 Dataset** as a common benchmark for video inpainting, consisting of 30 videos for training and 20 videos for testing. They also mention that they generate inpainted videos using state-of-the-art video inpainting approaches, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their evaluation.

For the **Free-form Video Inpainting Dataset**, the authors state that it provides 100 test videos, primarily targeting multi-instance object removal. This dataset is also significant for testing the generalization of their approach.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **DAVIS 2016 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Federico Perazzi, Jordi Pont-Tuset, Brian McWilliams, Luc Van Gool, Markus Gross, and Alexander Sorkine-Hornung. *A benchmark dataset and evaluation methodology for video object segmentation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2016, 2016.

- For the **Free-form Video Inpainting Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ya-Liang Chang, Zhe Yu Liu, Kuan-Ying Lee, and Winston Hsu. *Free-form video inpainting with 3D gated convolution and temporal patchgan*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2019.

Having gathered this information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
