To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Classification of 12-Lead ECG Signals with Bi-directional LSTM Network" by Ahmed Mostayed et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained and validated their classifier using the **Chinese physiological signal challenge dataset**, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the dataset. The introduction mentions that the dataset consists of recordings used for detecting various abnormalities in ECG signals, specifically noting that it is part of the 2018 China physiological signal challenge. This reinforces the importance of the dataset in their research.

In the **Materials and Methods** section, particularly in **section 2.3 (Data Preparation)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the **Chinese physiological challenge dataset**. They mention that it consists of 6,877 publicly available 12-lead ECG recordings, which include one normal class and eight abnormal classes. This section also notes the sampling rate and the duration of the recordings, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's characteristics.

I will also check the **Results** and **Discussion** sections to see if the authors refer to the dataset again, which they do when discussing the performance of their model on the validation set derived from this dataset.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Chinese physiological signal challenge dataset**. However, the dataset itself does not have a specific citation provided in the references. Instead, it is linked to the challenge website, which I will note as the source.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> Chinese Physiological Signal Challenge. Available at: http://www.icbeb.org/Challenge.html

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation. This will allow for a clear and comprehensive understanding of the dataset used in the research.

In summary, I have identified the **Chinese physiological signal challenge dataset** as the primary dataset used in this research, and I have gathered all necessary details to create a complete entry for it.
