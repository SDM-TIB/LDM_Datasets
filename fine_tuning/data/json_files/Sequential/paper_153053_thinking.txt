To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LSTM Networks Can Perform Dynamic Counting" by Mirac Suzgun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments conducted, which may include mentions of specific datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly sections 5 and 6, where the authors describe the tasks and the datasets used for training their models. In section 6, the authors discuss four different languages: Dyck-1, Shufﬂe-2, Shufﬂe-6, and Dyck-2. Each of these languages is associated with specific datasets generated for the experiments.

1. **Dyck-1 Language**: The authors generated 10,000 distinct Dyck-1 sequences for the training set, with lengths bounded to [2, 50]. They also created two test sets: a short test set with 5,000 distinct sequences and a long test set with 5,000 distinct sequences of lengths [52, 100].

2. **Shufﬂe-2 Language**: The training set for this language contained 10,000 distinct sequences, with similar length constraints as the Dyck-1 language. The authors also created short and long test sets with 5,000 distinct sequences each.

3. **Shufﬂe-6 Language**: For this language, the authors generated a training set of 30,000 samples, again with the same length constraints. The short and long test sets were also composed of 5,000 distinct sequences each.

4. **Dyck-2 Language**: The authors generated 10,000 distinct Dyck-2 sequences for the training set, with the same length constraints as the previous languages. They also created two test sets with 5,000 distinct sequences each.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. However, since the datasets are synthetically generated for the experiments, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will document the details of how these datasets were created as described in the paper.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant details about each dataset, such as the number of sequences, length constraints, and any specific characteristics mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary information is clearly presented.
