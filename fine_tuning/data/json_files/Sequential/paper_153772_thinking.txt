To extract datasets from the research paper titled "High-Performance Long-Term Tracking with Meta-Updater" by Jianhua Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on several benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the shift from short-term to long-term tracking and mention specific long-term tracking benchmarks. This indicates that there are datasets relevant to their research.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for a dedicated subsection on datasets or any mention of datasets used for evaluation. The authors specifically mention the following datasets:

1. **VOT2018LT**: This dataset is referenced multiple times throughout the paper, indicating its significance in the experiments. It contains 35 challenging sequences of diverse objects, with a total length of 146,817 frames.

2. **VOT2019LT**: This dataset is also highlighted, containing 50 videos with 215,294 frames in total. It is noted for its increased difficulty compared to VOT2018LT.

3. **OxUvALT**: The authors describe this dataset as containing 366 object tracks in 337 videos, selected from YTBB, with an average video length of 2.4 minutes.

4. **LaSOT**: This dataset is mentioned as a large-scale dataset with 1,400 challenging sequences and high-quality annotations.

5. **TLP**: The authors refer to this dataset, which contains 50 HD videos from real-world scenarios.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **VOT2018LT**, the citation is:
  > Matej Kristan, Ales Leonardis, Jiri Matas, Michael Felsberg, Roman Pfugfelder, Luka Cehovin Zajc, Tomas Vojir, Goutam Bhat, Alan Lukezic, Abdelrahman Eldesokey, Gustavo Fernandez, and et al. *The sixth visual object tracking VOT2018 challenge results*. In ECCVW, 2018.

- For **VOT2019LT**, the citation is:

- For **LaSOT**, the citation is:
  > Heng Fan, Liting Lin, Fan Yang, Peng Chu, Ge Deng, Sijia Yu, Hexin Bai, Yong Xu, Chunyuan Liao, and Haibin Ling. *LaSOT: A high-quality benchmark for large-scale single object tracking*. In CVPR, 2019.

- For **TLP**, the citation is:
  > Abhinav Moudgil and Vineet Gandhi. *Long-term visual object tracking benchmark*. In ACCV, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited for future reference or analysis.
