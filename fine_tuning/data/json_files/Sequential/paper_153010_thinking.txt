To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks" by Mingxing Tan and Quoc V. Le, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on various datasets, including ImageNet and several transfer learning datasets. This indicates that there are datasets that need to be identified.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** section, particularly in **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors evaluate their models. Here, they discuss the performance of their EfficientNet models on ImageNet and several transfer learning datasets. 

In **Table 6**, the authors provide a list of transfer learning datasets, which includes:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images across 10 classes.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, containing 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
3. **Birdsnap**: A dataset with 47,386 training images and 2,443 test images, consisting of 500 classes.
4. **Stanford Cars**: Contains 8,144 training images and 8,041 test images across 196 classes.
5. **Flowers**: A dataset with 2,040 training images and 6,149 test images across 102 classes.
6. **FGVC Aircraft**: Contains 6,667 training images and 3,333 test images across 100 classes.
7. **Oxford-IIIT Pets**: A dataset with 75,750 training images and 3,369 test images across 37 classes.
8. **Food-101**: Contains 101 classes with 50,000 training images and 25,250 test images.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
