To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transfer Learning for Autonomous Chatter Detection in Machining" by Melih C. Yesilli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental procedure sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges in chatter detection and mentions the use of data from turning and milling experiments, indicating that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental procedure section** where the authors describe the data collection methods for both turning and milling processes. Here, they provide specific details about the experimental setups, including the types of data collected, the parameters used, and the conditions under which the data was gathered.

In the **experimental procedure**, the authors mention:

1. **Turning Dataset**: Data collected from turning experiments with varying overhang distances (5.08 cm, 6.35 cm, 8.89 cm, and 11.43 cm). The dataset includes time series data tagged based on stability conditions (stable, intermediate, unstable).

2. **Milling Dataset**: Data collected from milling experiments using an aluminum workpiece. The dataset includes time series data sampled at 25 kHz, with specific cutting parameters provided.

I will also check the **results section** to confirm that these datasets were used in the experiments and to see if any additional datasets are mentioned.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or methodologies referenced in the paper. This may include foundational datasets or methods that the authors built upon.

For the **Turning Dataset**, the citation is:
> Yesilli, M. C., Khasawneh, F. A., & Otto, A. (2020). On transfer learning for chatter detection in turning using wavelet packet transform and ensemble empirical mode decomposition. *CIRP Journal of Manufacturing Science and Technology*, 28, 118-135.

For the **Milling Dataset**, the citation is:
> Yesilli, M. C., Khasawneh, F. A., & Otto, A. (2020). Chatter detection in milling using machine learning and similarity measures of time series via dynamic time warping. *Unpublished results*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
