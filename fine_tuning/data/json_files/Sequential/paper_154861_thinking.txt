To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Incorporating Reachability Knowledge into a Multi-Spatial Graph Convolution Based Seq2Seq Model for Traffic Forecasting" by Jiexia Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the model is evaluated on **two real-world traffic datasets**, which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they describe the datasets as follows:

1. **METR Dataset**: This dataset collects traffic speed data from 207 sensors on the highways of Los Angeles County, covering a time period from March 1st to June 30th, 2012.

2. **PEMS Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from California Transportation Agenciesâ€™ Performance Measurement System (PeMS), containing data from over 39,000 sensors across major metropolitan areas in California. The specific data used in this paper spans six months from January to May 2017, with 325 sensors selected for analysis.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the datasets are typically not cited in the same way as academic papers, so I will summarize the information provided in the paper itself.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions, ensuring to include the relevant details such as the number of sensors, the time period of data collection, and the geographical context.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined with its respective details for further processing or review.
