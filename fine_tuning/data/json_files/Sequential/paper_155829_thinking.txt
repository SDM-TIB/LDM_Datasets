To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Time Series Analysis in American Stock Market Recovering in Post COVID-19 Pandemic Period" by Weilin Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions using data for ETFs of the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, and Dow Jones Industrial Average, which indicates that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Data)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. In this section, they specifically mention the stock indices analyzed, including:

1. **S&P 500**: A stock index comprised of the 500 largest U.S. publicly traded companies by market capitalization.
2. **QQQ**: An exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index, which includes the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq.
3. **DJIA**: A stock market index that tracks 30 large, publicly owned blue-chip companies trading on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.
4. **IXIC**: A stock market index that includes almost all stocks listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange.

The authors clarify that the S&P 500 was selected for the final model due to its comprehensive representation of the U.S. stock market.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are widely recognized financial indices, I will provide the standard references for them:

- For **S&P 500**, the citation is:
  > Standard & Poor's. *S&P 500 Index*. Available at: https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-500/

- For **Nasdaq-100 (QQQ)**, the citation is:
  > Invesco. *Invesco QQQ Trust*. Available at: https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/qqq

- For **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)**, the citation is:
  > S&P Dow Jones Indices. *Dow Jones Industrial Average*. Available at: https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/dow-jones-industrial-average/

- For **NASDAQ Composite (IXIC)**, the citation is:
  > NASDAQ. *NASDAQ Composite Index*. Available at: https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/quotes/nasdaq-ixic

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
