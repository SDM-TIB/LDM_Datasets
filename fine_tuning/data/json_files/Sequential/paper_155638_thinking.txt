To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "PoseIt: A Visual-Tactile Dataset of Holding Poses for Grasp Stability Analysis" by Shubham Kanitkar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the PoseIt dataset, which is a multi-modal dataset aimed at studying grasp stability in various holding poses. This indicates that the dataset is central to the paper's contributions.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** or **data collection** sections, specifically section III, where the authors describe the PoseIt dataset in detail. Here, they mention that PoseIt consists of 1840 grasp datapoints collected from 26 distinct objects, with 16 different holding poses for each object. This section provides essential details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **experiments** and **results** sections to see if the authors reference any other datasets or provide additional context about the PoseIt dataset's use in their experiments. However, it appears that the primary focus is on the PoseIt dataset itself.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the PoseIt dataset. Since the dataset is publicly released, I will note the URL provided in the paper for access.

The full citation for the PoseIt dataset is:
> Shubham Kanitkar, Helen Jiang, Wenzhen Yuan. *PoseIt: A Visual-Tactile Dataset of Holding Poses for Grasp Stability Analysis*. Available at: https://github.com/CMURoboTouch/PoseIt.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary details for future reference or processing.
