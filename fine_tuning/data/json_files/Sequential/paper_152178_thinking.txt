To extract datasets from the research paper titled "English Conversational Telephone Speech Recognition by Humans and Machines" by George Saon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of speech recognition systems on the Switchboard conversational corpus, which suggests that this dataset is relevant.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention the human word error rates (WER) on the Switchboard and CallHome subsets of the NIST Hub5 2000 evaluation testset. This indicates that both the Switchboard and CallHome datasets are significant for their research.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any specific details about the datasets used for training and evaluation. The authors mention using "hours of Switchboard 1 audio with transcripts provided by Mississippi State University" and "1698 hours from the Fisher data collection and 15 hours of CallHome audio." This provides clear information about the datasets involved.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. **Switchboard Dataset**: The citation is:
   > J. Fiscus, W. M. Fisher, A. F. Martin, M. A. Przybocki, and D. S. Pallett. "2000 NIST evaluation of conversational speech recognition over the telephone: English and Mandarin performance results." In Proc. Speech Transcription Workshop, 2000, pp. 1â€“5.

2. **CallHome Dataset**: The citation is:
   > A. P. Black, M. J. Black, and J. Fiscus. "CallHome American English Speech: LDC97S42." Linguistic Data Consortium, 1997.

3. **Fisher Dataset**: The citation is:
   > G. Saon, H.-K. Kuo, S. Rennie, and M. Picheny. "The IBM 2016 English conversational speech recognition system." In Seventeenth Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
