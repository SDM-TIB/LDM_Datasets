To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to forecast vegetation greenness at fine resolution over Africa with ConvLSTMs" by Claire Robin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors use **Sentinel-2 satellite NDVI**, **ERA5 weather reanalysis**, **SMAP satellite measurements**, and **topography (DEM of SRTMv4.1)** as variables for their predictions. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the **dataset description** part, which is likely to provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, the authors describe their dataset as containing **over 40,000 samples**, referred to as **minicubes**, which consist of high-resolution satellite imagery and various environmental variables. They specify that the data spans from **2016 to 2021** and includes multiple sources.

The key datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery**: This dataset includes reflectance bands (red, blue, green, and near-infrared) used to compute the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The authors note that this dataset is crucial for vegetation health monitoring.

2. **ERA5 Weather Reanalysis**: This dataset provides various weather variables such as surface pressure, net solar radiation, temperature, and precipitation, which are used to guide the predictions.

3. **SMAP Satellite Measurements**: This dataset includes soil moisture data, which is essential for understanding vegetation dynamics.

4. **Topography from SRTMv4.1 DEM**: This dataset provides elevation data, which is used to inform the model about the terrain.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The relevant citations are:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
