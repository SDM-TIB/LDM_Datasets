To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Label-Efficient Audio Classification Through Multitask Learning and Self-Supervision" by Tyler Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experimental setup, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of various datasets for audio classification tasks, which indicates that there are specific datasets I need to identify.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of training deep neural networks with limited labeled data and the potential of using self-supervised tasks. This section may provide context for the datasets used but may not name them directly.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors describe the supervised tasks. Here, they mention three distinct supervised tasks: audio tagging, speaker identification, and speech command recognition. Each task is likely associated with a specific dataset.

1. **FSDKaggle2018 Dataset**: This dataset is used for the audio tagging task. The authors describe it as containing 11,073 audio files, which are uncompressed PCM 16 bit, 44.1 kHz, monaural audio. 

2. **VoxCeleb-1 Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for the speaker identification task. It consists of 336 hours of data from 1,251 speakers, sourced from interviews with celebrities.

3. **Speech Commands Dataset**: This dataset is used for the speech command recognition task. It contains 65,000 utterances of 30 short words, formatted in one-second WAVE files.

Additionally, the authors mention that the self-supervised tasks were trained on the **Librispeech Dataset**, which is used for auxiliary tasks and is not a primary dataset for the supervised tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **FSDKaggle2018 Dataset**, the citation is:

Channing Moore, Manoj Plakal, and Marvin Ritter. *Audio set: An ontology and human-labeled dataset for audio events*. 2017 IEEE ICASSP, Mar 2017. doi: 10.1109/icassp.2017.7952261.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
