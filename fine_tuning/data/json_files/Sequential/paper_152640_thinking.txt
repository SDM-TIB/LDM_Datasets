To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating the Ability of LSTMs to Learn Context-Free Grammars" by Luzi Sennhauser and Robert C. Berwick, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to delve deeper into the introduction and methods to find specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of LSTMs for a bracket completion problem, but they do not mention any datasets directly. I will then proceed to the **corpus section** (section 3), where the authors describe the synthetic corpus they used for their experiments. They mention that the corpus consists of a Dyck language with two types of brackets and that they generated 1 million sentences according to a specific grammar.

Next, I will look for any references to existing datasets or corpora in the **related work section** or the **experiments section**. However, it appears that the authors created their own synthetic dataset rather than using established datasets from previous research.

Now, I will compile the details of the synthetic dataset:

1. **Synthetic Dyck Language Corpus**: This dataset consists of 1 million generated sentences based on a Dyck language grammar with two types of brackets (square brackets `[]` and curly brackets `{}`). The sentences are generated with specific probabilities for the rules, and the length of each sentence is capped at 100 characters.

Since this is a synthetic dataset created by the authors, I will note that it does not have a formal citation like established datasets. However, I will still document it as follows:

- **Synthetic Dyck Language Corpus**: Generated for the purpose of this study, consisting of 1 million sentences based on a Dyck language grammar.

Finally, I will check the **References section** to ensure that I have captured any relevant citations for the methodologies or theories that underpin the dataset creation, but since this is a synthetic dataset, it will not have a traditional citation.

Now, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset information clearly, ensuring that I include the context of the dataset's creation and its relevance to the study.
