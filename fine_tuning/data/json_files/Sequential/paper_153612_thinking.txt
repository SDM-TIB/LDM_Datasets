To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MixPath: A Unified Approach for One-shot Neural Architecture Search" by Xiangxiang Chu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments and evaluated their method on a subset of **NAS-Bench-101**. This indicates that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on **NAS-Bench-101**. They describe it as a common benchmark for neural architecture search, which confirms its relevance as a dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for **NAS-Bench-101**. The citation is as follows:
> Ying, C., Klein, A., Christiansen, E., Real, E., Murphy, K., & Hutter, F. (2019). *Nas-bench-101: Towards reproducible neural architecture search*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), pp. 7105–7114.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. In section 4.2, the authors mention conducting experiments on the **CIFAR-10** dataset. This is a well-known dataset for image classification tasks. I will also retrieve its citation from the references section:
> Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Tech. rep., Citeseer.

In section 4.3, the authors mention searching on the **ImageNet** dataset, which is another significant dataset in the field of computer vision. The citation for ImageNet is:
> Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 248–255.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. The datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **NAS-Bench-101**
   - Citation: Ying, C., Klein, A., Christiansen, E., Real, E., Murphy, K., & Hutter, F. (2019). *Nas-bench-101: Towards reproducible neural architecture search*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), pp. 7105–7114.

2. **CIFAR-10**
   - Citation: Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Tech. rep., Citeseer.

3. **ImageNet**
   - Citation: Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 248–255.

With this information, I am ready to present the dataset entries in the required format for any further analysis or documentation.
