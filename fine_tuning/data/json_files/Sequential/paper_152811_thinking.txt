To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AntisymmetricRNN: A Dynamical System View on Recurrent Neural Networks" by Bo Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experiments section typically details the datasets employed in the study.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and mention that they will showcase their new architecture through extensive simulations and experiments. However, they do not specify any datasets here.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their evaluation on various tasks. They mention using the **MNIST dataset** for pixel-by-pixel classification and the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for a similar task. They also introduce a modified version of CIFAR-10 called **noise padded CIFAR-10** to create long-range dependencies.

I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is used for classifying handwritten digits. The authors mention it was proposed by Le et al. (1998) and is a standard benchmark for evaluating models on long-term dependencies.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 32x32 color images across 10 classes, as referenced by Krizhevsky & Hinton (2009). The authors use it for pixel-by-pixel classification tasks.

3. **Noise Padded CIFAR-10**: This is a modified version of the CIFAR-10 dataset where noise is introduced after the first 32 time steps to test the model's ability to remember long-range dependencies.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
