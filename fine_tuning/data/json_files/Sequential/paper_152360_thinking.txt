To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Grid Long Short-Term Memory" by Nal Kalchbrenner, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions the application of the Grid LSTM to algorithmic tasks and empirical tasks, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section** (Section 4). This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. I will pay close attention to any tables, figures, or text that explicitly name datasets or provide context about their use.

In Section 4.1, the authors discuss their experiments with a 15-digit integer addition task, but they do not mention a dataset here. However, in Section 4.3, they refer to the **Wikipedia character prediction benchmark**, which is a dataset they used for evaluating their model. I will note this dataset down.

In Section 4.4, they mention using the **IWSLT BTEC Chinese-to-English corpus** for their translation task. This is another dataset that I need to document.

I will also check the **appendix** for any additional datasets mentioned, particularly in the context of the MNIST dataset, which is referenced in the experiments on image classification.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For the **Wikipedia dataset**, the citation is:
   > Hutter, Marcus. *The human knowledge compression context*. 2012. URL: http://prize.hutter1.net.

2. For the **IWSLT BTEC Chinese-to-English corpus**, the citation is:
   > Kalchbrenner, Nal and Blunsom, Phil. *Recurrent continuous translation models*. In Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), Seattle, October 2013.

3. For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
   > LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., and Haffner, P. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278â€“2324, 1998.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
