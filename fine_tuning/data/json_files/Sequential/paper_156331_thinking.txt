To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Realizing Stabilized Landing for Computation-Limited Reusable Rockets: A Quantum Reinforcement Learning Approach" by Gyu Seon Kim, JaeHyun Chung, and Soohyun Park, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the integration of quantum reinforcement learning into control systems for reusable rockets but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction primarily discusses the significance of reusable rockets and the challenges in their landing but does not provide specific dataset names.

Moving on to the **methodology and experiments sections**, I will look for any mention of datasets used for training or evaluation. In the **performance evaluation section**, the authors mention using the **Lunar-Lander** environment provided by OpenAI Gym for their experiments. This indicates that the Lunar-Lander dataset is relevant to their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Lunar-Lander dataset. The citation for the OpenAI Gym is typically referenced in the following manner:

- For the **Lunar-Lander dataset**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., & Schulman, J. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

In summary, I have identified the **Lunar-Lander dataset** as the primary dataset used in this research, and I will ensure to include its full citation in the final output.
