To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BayesNAS: A Bayesian Approach for Neural Architecture Search" by Hongpeng Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, including any datasets used for experiments. 

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** section, as this is where the authors usually describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. I will pay close attention to any dataset names, descriptions, and the context in which they are used.

In this paper, I will specifically look for sections that detail the experiments conducted, as they often include information about the datasets. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names, the number of samples, and any relevant characteristics (e.g., types of data, annotations).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, I would look for its citation in the references. The citation for CIFAR-10 is typically:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2009.

If the paper also mentions another dataset, such as **ImageNet**, I would find its citation as well:
> Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Examine the experiments section for detailed descriptions of datasets used.
3. Note the names, characteristics, and context of each dataset.
4. Check the references section for full citations of each dataset.
5. Compile the information into a clear and organized format for future reference.
