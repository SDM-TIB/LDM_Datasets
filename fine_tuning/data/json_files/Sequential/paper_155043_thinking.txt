To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Opacus: User-Friendly Differential Privacy Library in PyTorch" by Ashkan Yousefpour et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the library and its capabilities, but it may not detail specific datasets. The introduction may provide context about the datasets used for benchmarking the library.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 3 (Benchmarks)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using several datasets for benchmarking the performance of Opacus. Specifically, I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments, including their names and descriptions.

Upon reviewing the experiments section, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class.
3. **IMDb Dataset**: A dataset consisting of movie reviews used for sentiment classification, which is commonly used in natural language processing tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. 1998. URL: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

- For the **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. University of Toronto, 2009. URL: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

- For the **IMDb Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andrew Maas, Raymond E Daly, Peter T Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis*. In: Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies - Volume 1. 2011, pp. 142â€“150.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and attributed in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
