To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Hybrid Model for Forecasting Short-Term Electricity Demand" by Maria Eleni Athanasopoulou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the HYENA model and its performance in forecasting electricity demand, which suggests that datasets are involved, particularly related to electricity demand and weather data.

Next, I will focus on the **input data and sources section** (2.1) where the authors describe the datasets used in their model. Here, they mention:

1. **Load Data**: This dataset consists of national demand consumption for the UK, spanning from January 2018 to February 2020, obtained from the BM Reports API. This dataset is crucial for understanding electricity demand patterns.

2. **Weather Data**: The weather data was sourced from the CEDA website, specifically using the Land Synop data. This dataset is essential for correlating weather conditions with electricity demand.

3. **Embedded Generation Data**: The authors collected daily estimations of embedded solar and wind installed capacity reported by the National Grid. This dataset helps in understanding the impact of renewable energy on electricity demand.

4. **Holiday Data**: The exact dates of holidays were obtained from the UK government website, which is used as an auxiliary feature in the forecasting model.

In the **conclusions section**, the authors summarize the effectiveness of their model based on the datasets used, reinforcing the importance of these datasets in their analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **BM Reports API**, while the paper does not provide a formal citation, I can reference it as:
  > BM Reports. *BM Reports API*. Retrieved from https://www.bmreports.com/

- For the **Land Synop data**, the citation is:
  > Centre NCAS. *LAND SYNOP reports from land stations collected by the Met Office MetDB system*. Retrieved from https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/9f80d42106ba708f92ada730ba321831, 2020.

- For the **National Grid data**, the citation is:

- For the **holiday data**, the citation is:
  > UK Government. *Public Holidays in the UK*. Retrieved from https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
