To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Previsão dos Preços de Abertura, Mínima e Máxima de Índices de Mercados Financeiros Usando a Associação de Redes Neurais LSTM" by Gabriel de Oliveira Guedes Nogueira and Marcel Otoboni de Lima, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the dataset consists of historical data from over 10 indices from the world's largest stock exchanges, which suggests that specific datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Material e métodos)**, particularly **subsection 3.1 (Obtenção dos dados)**, where the authors describe the data sources. They mention that the historical trading data for the indices was extracted from Yahoo! Finance, which is a crucial detail for identifying the dataset.

In **Table 1**, the authors list the market indices used in their experiments. The indices include:

1. **Índice BOVESPA (BVSP)** - Brazil
2. **NYSE Composite (NYA)** - USA
3. **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI)** - USA
4. **NASDAQ Composite (IXIC)** - USA
5. **Russell 2000 Index (RUT)** - USA
6. **CAC 40 (FCHI)** - France
7. **Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index (FTSE)** - UK
8. **SSE Composite Index (000001.SS)** - China
9. **Hang Seng Index (HSI)** - Hong Kong
10. **Nikkei Stock Average (N225)** - Japan
11. **S&P Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index (BSESN)** - India

This list confirms the specific datasets used in the research.

Now, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to the datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from Yahoo! Finance and do not have formal citations like traditional datasets, I will note that the data source is Yahoo! Finance and provide the URL for reference.

The citation for the data source is:
> Yahoo! Finance. "Market Index." Available at: https://finance.yahoo.com/. Accessed on December 13, 2020.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant details and citations for each dataset used in the research paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the study.
