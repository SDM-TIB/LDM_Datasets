To extract datasets from the research paper titled "N-GRAM LANGUAGE MODELING USING RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK ESTIMATION" by Ciprian Chelba, Mohammad Norouzi, and Samy Bengio, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions experiments on a small corpus (UPenn Treebank) and the One Billion Words benchmark, indicating that these are datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look specifically in **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. They mention:

1. **UPenn Treebank**: This dataset consists of one million words of training data and a vocabulary of 10,000 words. The validation/test data contains 73,760/82,430 words, respectively.

2. **One Billion Words Benchmark**: This dataset is referenced in relation to the experiments conducted and is noted to be the same as in the work by Chelba et al. (2013).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **UPenn Treebank**, the citation is:
  > M. Abadi and et al. Recurrent neural networks tutorial (language modeling), 2015a. URL https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/tutorials/recurrent/index.html.

- For **One Billion Words Benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Ciprian Chelba, Tomas Mikolov, Mike Schuster, Qi Ge, Thorsten Brants, and Phillipp Koehn. *One billion word benchmark for measuring progress in statistical language modeling*. CoRR, abs/1312.3005, 2013. URL http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.3005.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research along with their proper citations.
