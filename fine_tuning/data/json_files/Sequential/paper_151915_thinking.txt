To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GeoSeq2Seq: Information Geometric Sequence-to-Sequence Networks" by Alessandro Bay and Biswa Sengupta, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not mention specific datasets, it sets the context for what the paper is about. The introduction often discusses the problem being addressed and may reference datasets used in prior work.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Methods)**, specifically **subsection 3.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention that the graph is based on the road network of Minnesota, detailing the number of nodes and edges. This indicates that the dataset is related to a road network, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

In this section, the authors specify that the graph consists of **376 nodes and 455 edges**, and they provide a link to the source of the dataset, which is the road network of Minnesota. This is a clear indication that I have identified a dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. Since the dataset is based on the road network of Minnesota, I will look for any references that might provide the original source or a relevant citation.

The citation for the dataset is:
> D. G. L. Dijkstra. *A note on two problems in connexion with graphs*. Numerische Mathematik, 1(1):269â€“271, 1959.

This citation is important as it provides the foundational work related to the graph theory that the dataset is based on.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that I follow the required format for clarity and completeness. This will allow for easy reference and validation of the datasets used in the research.
