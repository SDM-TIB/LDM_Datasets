To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Keyphrase Generation with Fine-Grained Evaluation-Guided Reinforcement Learning" by Yichao Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions experiments on keyphrase generation benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three public scientific keyphrase generation datasets: **Inspec**, **Krapivin**, and **KP20k**. I will take note of these names and any details provided about them.

I will then look for any additional information about these datasets in the **related work** or **methodology sections** to gather more context on how they were used in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

The citations I need to extract are as follows:

1. **Inspec Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Anette Hulth and Béata Megyesi. *A study on automatically extracted keywords in text categorization*. In ACL 2006, 21st International Conference on Computational Linguistics and 44th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, Proceedings of the Conference, Sydney, Australia, 17-21 July 2006, page 537–544. The Association for Computer Linguistics.

2. **Krapivin Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Mikalai Krapivin, Aliaksandr Autaeu, and Maurizio Marchese. *Large dataset for keyphrases extraction*. Technical report, University of Trento, 2009.

3. **KP20k Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Rui Meng, Sanqiang Zhao, Shuguang Han, Daqing He, Peter Brusilovsky, and Yu Chi. *Deep keyphrase generation*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL 2017, Vancouver, Canada, July 30 - August 4, Volume 1: Long Papers, pages 582–592. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
