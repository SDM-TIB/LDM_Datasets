To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fashion-IQ 2020 Challenge 2nd Place Team’s Solution" by Minchul Shin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to gather initial insights about any datasets referenced. The abstract mentions the Fashion-IQ challenge, which suggests that the dataset used is likely the Fashion-IQ dataset itself.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **method section**. Here, the authors describe their approach and mention that they used the **DeepFashion dataset** for training their image retrieval model. This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved: the Fashion-IQ dataset and the DeepFashion dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss their performance metrics and how they achieved their results using the Fashion-IQ dataset. They also provide an overview of the dataset in the appendix, which confirms its significance in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

1. **Fashion-IQ Dataset**: The authors do not provide a specific citation for the Fashion-IQ dataset in the references, but it is implied to be the dataset used for the challenge. I will note that it is a dataset specifically designed for the Fashion-IQ challenge.

2. **DeepFashion Dataset**: The citation for the DeepFashion dataset is:
   > Yuying Ge, Ruimao Zhang, Xiaogang Wang, Xiaoou Tang, and Ping Luo. *Deepfashion2: A versatile benchmark for detection, pose estimation, segmentation and re-identification of clothing images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 5337–5345, 2019.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Fashion-IQ Dataset**: Used for the Fashion-IQ challenge, details about the dataset can be found in the challenge documentation.
- **DeepFashion Dataset**: A comprehensive dataset for fashion-related tasks, providing rich annotations for various applications.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
