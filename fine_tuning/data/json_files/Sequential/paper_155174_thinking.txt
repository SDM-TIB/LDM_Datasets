To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data Processing Matters: SRPH-Konvergen AI’s Machine Translation System for WMT’21" by Lintang Sutawika and Jan Christian Blaise Cruz, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in the WMT’21 Large Scale Multilingual Translation Task, which suggests that they likely used specific datasets for their experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the languages involved in their multilingual machine translation system, which hints at the datasets used. They refer to the **FLORES-101 devtest set** as a benchmark for evaluation, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for their work.

Next, I will look into the **data preprocessing section** (Section 2) where the authors describe various datasets they utilized. They mention several sources of parallel text, including:

1. **FLORES-101**: This dataset is explicitly mentioned as the evaluation benchmark for their models. It is essential to note its significance in their experiments.

2. **CCAligned**: A massive collection of cross-lingual web-document pairs, which is also referenced in the context of their preprocessing techniques.

3. **MultiCCAligned**: Another dataset mentioned alongside CCAligned, indicating its relevance in their data processing.

4. **ParaCrawl**: This dataset is noted as a source of parallel text, which is important for multilingual translation tasks.

5. **TED2020**: Cited as a dataset used for training, which is significant for understanding the context of their machine translation system.

6. **WikiMatrix**: Mentioned as a source of parallel sentences mined from Wikipedia, which is relevant for their multilingual approach.

7. **OpenSubtitles**: This dataset is included as part of their preprocessing, indicating its role in the training data.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The citations I will extract include:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for further processing or review.
