To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-stream CNN based Video Semantic Segmentation for Automated Driving" by Ganesh Sistu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on several datasets, specifically highlighting the **SYNTHIA-CVPR’16 dataset**, **KITTI**, **DAVIS**, and **SegTrack V2**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments discussed in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. They explicitly mention:

1. **SYNTHIA**: A synthetic dataset for semantic segmentation in urban scenes, which is used for training and evaluation. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Ros, G., Sellart, L., Materzynska, J., Vazquez, D., and Lopez, A. M. (2016). *The SYNTHIA dataset: A large collection of synthetic images for semantic segmentation of urban scenes*. In The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

2. **KITTI**: A well-known dataset for autonomous driving tasks, used for evaluating the proposed methods. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Geiger, A., Lenz, P., and Urtasun, R. (2012). *Are we ready for Autonomous Driving? The KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

3. **DAVIS**: A dataset for video object segmentation, which provides consecutive frames for evaluation. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Pont-Tuset, J., Perazzi, F., Caelles, S., Arbeláez, P., Sorkine-Hornung, A., and Van Gool, L. (2017). *The 2017 DAVIS Challenge on Video Object Segmentation*. arXiv:1704.00675.

4. **SegTrack V2**: Another dataset used for video segmentation tasks, which also provides consecutive frames. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Li, F., Kim, T., Humayun, A., Tsai, D., and Rehg, J. M. (2013). *Video segmentation by tracking many figure-ground segments*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the context in which each dataset is used within the paper, particularly in the experiments section where their relevance is discussed.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
