To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Show and Speak: Directly Synthesize Spoken Descriptions of Images" by Xinsheng Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed model is evaluated on the **Flickr8k** dataset, which is a strong indicator that this dataset is crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3 (Experimental Setting)**, where the authors discuss the database used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly state that they used the **Flickr8k** dataset, which contains 8,000 images, each with 5 textual descriptions. This section confirms the dataset's significance in their research.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Flickr8k** dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- For **Flickr8k**, the citation is:
  > M. Hodosh, P. Young, and J. Hockenmaier. *Framing image description as a ranking task: Data, models and evaluation metrics*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, vol. 47, pp. 853â€“899, 2013.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets used for evaluation or training, I will conclude that **Flickr8k** is the only dataset relevant to this research.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and concise summary of the dataset used in the research paper.
