To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Signal Denoising with Encoder-Decoder Networks" by Leslie Casas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on **electrocardiogram (ECG) and motion signals**, which suggests that these may be the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluations. In **section III (Experiments)**, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **European Robotics Challenge (EuroC) MAV dataset**: This dataset consists of 11 sequences of inertial measurement unit sensors and motion capture data, specifically focusing on angular velocity and acceleration measured at 200Hz. The authors note that the noise in this signal is primarily Gaussian and random walk noise.

2. **Physionet ECG-ID database**: This dataset contains 310 ECG records from 90 subjects, with each record comprising the raw ECG signal and a manually filtered ground-truth version. The authors mention that this signal is often corrupted by power line interference, contact noise, and motion artifacts.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **EuroC MAV dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Burri, J. Nikolic, P. Gohl, T. Schneider, J. Rehder, S. Omari, M. W. Achtelik, and R. Siegwart. *The EuroC Micro Aerial Vehicle Datasets*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, 2016.

- For the **Physionet ECG-ID database**, the citation is:
  > A. L. Goldberger, L. A. Amaral, L. Glass, J. M. Hausdorff, P. C. Ivanov, R. G. Mark, J. E. Mietus, G. B. Moody, C.-K. Peng, and H. E. Stanley. *Physiobank, Physiotoolkit, and Physionet: Components of a New Research Resource for Complex Physiologic Signals*. Circulation, vol. 101, no. 23, pp. e215â€“e220, 2000.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
