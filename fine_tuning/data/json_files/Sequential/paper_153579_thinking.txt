To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Multi-cascaded Model with Data Augmentation for Enhanced Paraphrase Detection in Short Texts" by Muhammad Haroon Shakeel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the approach on **three benchmark datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section (Section 5)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Quora Questions Pairs Dataset**: This dataset contains pairs of questions with their annotations (paraphrase or non-paraphrase). The authors note that it consists of 517,968 unique questions, and they also mention correcting some incorrect annotations.

2. **Microsoft Research Paraphrase (MSRP) Corpus**: This dataset includes pairs of sentences extracted from news articles, with a total of 7,814 unique sentences. The authors highlight that there are no conflicting annotations in this dataset.

3. **SemEval-2015 Twitter Paraphrase Dataset**: This dataset contains pairs of tweets with their paraphrase/non-paraphrase annotations. The authors specify that it includes 13,231 unique tweets and that they ignore debatable annotations.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Quora Questions Pairs Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Quora. *Quora Question Pairs Dataset*. Available at: https://github.com/zhiguowang/BiMPM.

- For the **Microsoft Research Paraphrase (MSRP) Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Dolan, B., Quirk, C., & Brockett, C. (2004). *Unsupervised construction of large paraphrase corpora: Exploiting massively parallel news sources*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING), 350-357.

- For the **SemEval-2015 Twitter Paraphrase Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xu, W., Callison-Burch, C., & Dolan, B. (2015). *SemEval-2015 Task 1: Paraphrase and Semantic Similarity in Twitter (PIT)*. In Proceedings of the International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval), 1-11.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
