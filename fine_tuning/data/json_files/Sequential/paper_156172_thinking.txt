To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Point to the Hidden: Exposing Speech Audio Splicing via Signal Pointer Nets" by Denise Moussa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a pointer network framework for audio splicing detection, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.3 (Datasets and Training Strategy)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training their model. Here, they mention the use of the **anechoic ACE dataset** as a source set for generating samples. This dataset is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **experiments section** or in the references. The authors refer to the **Hi-Fi TTS set** for generating test sets, which is another important dataset to note.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Anechoic ACE Dataset**: The citation is:
   > J. Eaton, N. D. Gaubitch, A. H. Moore, and P. A. Naylor. "Estimation of Room Acoustic Parameters: The ACE Challenge." *IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing*, vol. 24, no. 10, pp. 1681–1693, 2016.

2. **Hi-Fi TTS Dataset**: The citation is:
   > E. Bakhturina, V. Lavrukhin, B. Ginsburg, and Y. Zhang. "Hi-Fi Multi-Speaker English TTS Dataset." In *INTERSPEECH 2021*, pp. 2776–2780, 2021.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details about each dataset, including their purpose and any specific characteristics mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all citations are correctly formatted and included.
