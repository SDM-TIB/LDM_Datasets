To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Sequence-to-Sequence Models for Abstractive Text Summarization Using Meta Heuristic Approaches" by Aditya Saxena and Ashutosh Ranjan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on the **CNN/DailyMail dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. Here, the authors discuss the challenges of summarization and reference the CNN/DailyMail dataset as a widely accepted benchmark for training models. This confirms its significance in their work.

In the **methodology section**, the authors provide details about their data preprocessing steps, specifically mentioning the **CNN/DailyMail dataset** again. They describe how this dataset contains approximately 90,000 documents, each consisting of an article and its corresponding summary. This reinforces the importance of this dataset in their experiments.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any additional context or details about the dataset used. They confirm that the CNN/DailyMail dataset was utilized for evaluating their models, which further solidifies its role in their research.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the CNN/DailyMail dataset. The dataset is commonly cited as follows:

- **CNN/DailyMail Dataset**: 
  > Abigail See, Peter J. Liu, and Christopher D. Manning. "Get To The Point: Summarization with Pointer-Generator Networks." In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1073â€“1083, 2017.

With this information, I will create an entry for the dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
