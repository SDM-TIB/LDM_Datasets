To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AdaEnsemble Learning Approach for Metro Passenger Flow Forecasting" by Shaolong Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and empirical study sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses smart card data from the Shenzhen metro system, which suggests that this is a primary dataset for the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Data description and evaluation criteria)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used. Here, they mention that the data was collected from three specific metro stations: Hui-Zhan-Zhong-Xin (HZZX), Fu-Ming (FM), and Gang-Xia (GX) stations. The data is aggregated into 15-minute intervals from transit smart cards between October 14, 2013, and November 30, 2013.

I will also note that the authors mention the division of the dataset into weekdays and weekends, which is important for understanding how the data is structured and used in their analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from the Shenzhen metro system and does not have a specific publication associated with it, I will note that the dataset is based on smart card data collected from the Shenzhen metro system, but it may not have a formal citation like other datasets.

To summarize the datasets extracted:

1. **Shenzhen Metro Smart Card Data**: This dataset includes passenger flow data collected from the HZZX, FM, and GX stations, aggregated into 15-minute intervals from October 14, 2013, to November 30, 2013. The data is divided into weekdays and weekends for analysis.

Since this dataset does not have a formal citation, I will document it as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Shenzhen Metro Smart Card Data
- **Description**: Passenger flow data collected from Hui-Zhan-Zhong-Xin (HZZX), Fu-Ming (FM), and Gang-Xia (GX) stations, aggregated into 15-minute intervals from October 14, 2013, to November 30, 2013. The data is divided into weekdays and weekends.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
