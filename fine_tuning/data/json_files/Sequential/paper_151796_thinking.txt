To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analyzing and Exploiting NARX Recurrent Neural Networks for Long-Term Dependencies" by Robert DiPietro et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention various tasks that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are applied to, but I need to look for specific datasets. I will pay close attention to any mentions of datasets in the context of experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions.

Upon reviewing the experiments section, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Sequential MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is used for the sequential MNIST classification task, which involves classifying images of handwritten digits presented in a sequential manner. The authors reference the original MNIST dataset (LeCun et al., 1998) as the source.

2. **MISTIC-SL Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for recognizing surgical maneuvers. The authors cite the work by Gao et al. (2014) and DiPietro et al. (2016) as the source of this dataset.

3. **TIMIT Corpus**: This dataset is used for phoneme recognition tasks. The authors reference the original TIMIT dataset (Garofolo et al., 1993) for this task.

4. **MobiAct Dataset**: This dataset is used for activity classification from smartphone motion data. The authors cite the work by Chatzaki et al. (2016) as the source of this dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **Sequential MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For the **MISTIC-SL Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yixin Gao, S. Swaroop Vedula, Carol E. Reiley, Narges Ahmidi, Balakrishnan Varadarajan, Henry C. Lin, Lingling Tao, Luca Zappella, Benjamn Bejar, David D. Yuh, Chi Chiung Grace Chen, Rene Vidal, Sanjeev Khudanpur, and Gregory D. Hager. *Language of surgery: A surgical gesture dataset for human motion modeling*. Modeling and Monitoring of Computer Assisted Interventions (M2CAI), 2014.

- For the **TIMIT Corpus**, the citation is:
  > John S. Garofolo, Lori F. Lamel, William M. Fisher, Jonathon G. Fiscus, and David S. Pallett. *DARPA TIMIT acoustic-phonetic continuous speech corpus CD-ROM*. NIST speech disc 1-1.1. NASA STI/Recon technical report, 1993.

- For the **MobiAct Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Charikleia Chatzaki, Matthew Pediaditis, George Vavoulas, and Manolis Tsiknakis. *Human daily activity and fall recognition using a smartphone’s acceleration sensor*. International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies for Ageing Well and e-Health, 2016.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited for future reference. This structured approach ensures that I capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
