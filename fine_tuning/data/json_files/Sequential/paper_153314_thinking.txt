To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Social and Scene-Aware Trajectory Prediction in Crowded Spaces" by Matteo Lisotto, Pasquale Coscia, and Lamberto Ballan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the construction of an LSTM-based model for trajectory prediction, but it does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they utilize two datasets: **ETH** and **UCY**. I will look for more details about these datasets in this section.

The paper describes the **ETH dataset** as containing two scenes (ETH and HOTEL) and the **UCY dataset** as comprising three scenes (UNIV/UCY, ZARA-01, ZARA-02). Both datasets are captured from a bird’s-eye view and involve various challenging scenarios, such as interacting pedestrians and nonlinear trajectories.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

The citations I find are:

- For the **ETH dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pellegrini, S., Ess, A., Schindler, K., & Gool, L. V. (2009). You'll never walk alone: Modeling social behavior for multi-target tracking. In 2009 IEEE 12th International Conference on Computer Vision (pp. 261–268).

- For the **UCY dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lerner, A., Chrysanthou, Y., & Lischinski, D. (2007). Crowds by example. Computer Graphics Forum, 26(3), 655–664.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, which is essential for proper academic referencing.
