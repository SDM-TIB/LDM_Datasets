To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RTbust: Exploiting Temporal Patterns for Botnet Detection on Twitter" by Michele Mazza et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected a dataset of **10 million retweets**, which is a significant dataset for their analysis.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data Collection and Annotation)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they used. They mention that their dataset consists of all Italian retweets shared over a two-week period, specifically from **June 17 to June 30, 2018**. The dataset includes **9,989,819 retweets** from **1,446,250 distinct users**, which is a crucial detail for understanding the scale of their research.

In this section, the authors also describe the data collection process, stating that they used the **Twitter Premium Search API** to gather the data, which is important for citing the dataset's source. They clarify that their dataset is limited to tweets in the Italian language, but the methodology can be adapted for other languages.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the dataset is primarily based on data collected from Twitter, I will note that the citation for the Twitter API is as follows:

- **Twitter Premium Search API**: 
  > Twitter Developer. *Twitter Premium Search API*. Available at: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/api-reference/premium-search.html

Additionally, the authors mention that they performed manual annotation on a subset of their dataset, which is useful for evaluating their bot detection technique. However, they do not provide a separate citation for this annotated dataset, as it is derived from their main dataset.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

1. **Dataset of Retweets**: Composed of **9,989,819 retweets** shared by **1,446,250 distinct users** in Italy from **June 17 to June 30, 2018**. The dataset was collected using the **Twitter Premium Search API**.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
