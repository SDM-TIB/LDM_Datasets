To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LSTMs with Attention for Aggression Detection" by Nishant Nikhil et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the system and its performance but does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 3**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used.

In **section 3 (Experiments)**, the authors describe the datasets constructed for the English and Hindi sub-tasks. They mention that the training datasets consist of **11,999 Facebook posts and comments for English** and **12,000 for Hindi**, with testing sets of **3,001 and 3,000**, respectively. This indicates that there are two primary datasets used for their experiments.

Next, I will look for any specific names or identifiers for these datasets. The authors state that these datasets were collected and manually annotated by the organizers of the shared task on aggression identification. They also reference a paper by Kumar et al. (2018b) for the data collection methods, which suggests that this paper may contain more details about the datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned in the context of the shared task. The relevant citation is:

- For the dataset used in the aggression identification task:
  > Ritesh Kumar, Aishwarya N. Reganti, Akshit Bhatia, and Tushar Maheshwari. *Aggression-annotated Corpus of Hindi-English Code-mixed Data*. In Proceedings of the 11th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC), Miyazaki, Japan, 2018.

This citation provides the necessary details about the dataset used for the experiments.

Now, I will summarize the datasets extracted:

1. **English Aggression Dataset**: Consists of 11,999 Facebook posts and comments, annotated for aggression detection.
2. **Hindi Aggression Dataset**: Consists of 12,000 Facebook posts and comments, annotated for aggression detection.

Both datasets were part of the shared task on aggression identification, and their details can be found in the paper by Kumar et al. (2018b).

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.
