To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WaveCycleGAN2: Time-domain Neural Post-filter for Speech Waveform Generation" by Kou Tanaka et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of an internal Japanese speech dataset and a public domain English speech dataset, which indicates that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In **section 5.1.1**, the authors describe the internal Japanese speech dataset, which consists of utterances by one professional female narrator, with about 6,500 sentences used for training and 30 sentences for evaluation. The sampling rate is noted as 22.05 kHz.

In **section 5.2.1**, the authors mention the use of the **LJ Speech Dataset**, which contains 13,100 utterances and is used for evaluating the performance of their proposed method. The sampling rate for this dataset is also 22.05 kHz.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **internal Japanese speech dataset**, since it is not a publicly available dataset, it may not have a formal citation. However, I will note its description as provided in the paper.

2. For the **LJ Speech Dataset**, the citation is:
   > K. Ito, “The LJ Speech dataset,” 2017. Available: https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information:

- **Internal Japanese Speech Dataset**: Contains utterances by one professional female narrator, used for training and evaluation in the experiments. Specific citation details are not available as it is an internal dataset.

- **LJ Speech Dataset**: A public domain English speech dataset containing 13,100 utterances, used for performance evaluation.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I include the full citations as required.
