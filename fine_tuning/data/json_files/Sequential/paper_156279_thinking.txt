To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Epileptic seizure forecasting with long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks" by Daniel E. Payne et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used **long-term intracranial EEG recordings from eight patients from the NeuroVista dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods section**, specifically the **Datasets subsection**. Here, the authors provide detailed information about the NeuroVista dataset, including its characteristics and how it was utilized in their study. They mention that the dataset consists of long-term intracranial EEG recordings from 15 patients, but only eight were used due to specific criteria. This section confirms that the NeuroVista dataset is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the NeuroVista dataset. The authors reference the original clinical trial that generated the dataset, which is crucial for providing a complete citation. The citation for the NeuroVista dataset is:

- **NeuroVista dataset**: 
  > Kuhlmann L, Karoly P, Freestone DR, Brinkmann BH, Temko A, Barachant A, et al. *Epilepsyecosystem.org: crowd-sourcing reproducible seizure prediction with long-term human intracranial EEG*. Brain. 2018;141(9):2619-30. doi: 10.1093/brain/awy210. 

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and ensure that I include the full citation in the final output. The NeuroVista dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, and it is critical to provide its citation accurately.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for review or further processing.
