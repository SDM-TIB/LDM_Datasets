To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MICE: Mining Idioms with Contextual Embeddings" by Tadej Škvorc et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a new dataset of multi-word expressions with literal and idiomatic meanings, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluation. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In **section 4.1 (Monolingual dataset)**, the authors introduce the **SloIE dataset**, which consists of 29,400 sentences extracted from the Gigaﬁda corpus and contains 75 different idiomatic expressions (IEs). This dataset is significant as it is specifically designed for idiom detection in the Slovene language.

In **section 4.2 (PARSEME datasets)**, the authors discuss the **PARSEME dataset**, which consists of 280,838 annotated sentences across 20 languages, focusing on verbal multi-word expressions, including idioms. This dataset is crucial for evaluating cross-lingual capabilities.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For the **SloIE dataset**, the citation is:
   > Škvorc, T., Gantar, P., & Robnik-Šikonja, M. (2021). *SloIE: A large dataset of idioms in less-resourced, morphologically rich Slovene language*. Available at: http://hdl.handle.net/11356/1335.

2. For the **PARSEME dataset**, the citation is:
   > Savary, A., Ramisch, C., Cordeiro, S., Sangati, F., Vincze, V., QasemiZadeh, B., Candito, M., Cap, F., Giouli, V., Stoyanova, I., Doucet, A. (2017). *The PARSEME shared task on automatic identification of verbal multiword expressions*. In Proceedings of the 13th Workshop on Multiword Expressions (MWE 2017), Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 31–47.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that I include all relevant details and citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
