To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PoinT-5: Pointer Network and T-5 based Financial Narrative Summarisation" by Abhishek Singh, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions the methodology used in the Financial Narrative Summarisation (FNS) 2020 task, which suggests that there is a dataset involved, but I need to confirm the details.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data Description)**, where the author explicitly describes the dataset used for the experiments. Here, I find that the dataset consists of **3,863 annual reports for firms listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE)**, covering the period from **2002 to 2017**. This section provides essential details about the dataset, including its size and the time frame it covers.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The dataset is referenced in the paper as being associated with the works of El-Haj et al. Here are the relevant citations:

- For the dataset of annual reports, the citation is:
  > Mahmoud El-Haj, Paul Rayson, Paulo Alves, Carlos Herrero-Zorita, and Steven Young. *Multilingual financial narrative processing: Analysing annual reports in English, Spanish and Portuguese*. In Multilingual Text Analysis: Challenges, Models, And Approaches, page 441, 2019.

Additionally, the dataset is mentioned in the context of previous works, which may also provide useful citations. However, the primary dataset citation is sufficient for my needs.

Now, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Financial Narrative Summarisation Dataset**: This dataset contains 3,863 annual reports for firms listed on the LSE, covering the period from 2002 to 2017.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary information and citations for the dataset mentioned in the paper.
