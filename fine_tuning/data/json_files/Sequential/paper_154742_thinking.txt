To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Time Series Long Short-term Memory RNN" by Adrian Kj√¶rran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or applications** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the context of LSTM applications.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **current applications sections**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the relevance of LSTMs in time series forecasting and mention various applications, which may hint at specific datasets used in those applications.

In the **current applications section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of how LSTMs were implemented in forecasting solar power production and natural language processing (NLP). The authors mention using weather data from power plants and the ELMo model for NLP, which suggests that there are datasets associated with these applications.

I will pay special attention to any **tables or figures** that summarize results, as they often include references to the datasets used. For example, the results for solar power forecasting might reference the specific dataset used for training and testing the LSTM model.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **bibliography** for full citations. For instance, if the authors refer to a dataset from a previous study, I will ensure to capture the complete citation from the references section.

From my reading, I anticipate finding the following datasets:

1. **Weather Data for Solar Power Forecasting**: This dataset is likely aggregated from multiple power plants over a specified time period. I will need to find the exact citation for the source of this dataset.

2. **SQuAD Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of NLP applications and is well-known in the field. I will ensure to include its full citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper.
