To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Experimental Evaluation of Deep Learning models for Marathi Text Classification" by Atharva Kulkarni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their models on two publicly available Marathi text classification datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data Resources)**, specifically **subsection 3.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors summarize the datasets used for experimentation. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **IndicNLP News Article Dataset**: This dataset consists of news articles in Marathi categorized into three classes: sports, entertainment, and lifestyle. It contains 4,779 records with predefined splits for training, testing, and validation (3,823 for training, 479 for testing, and 477 for validation). The average length of a record is approximately 250 words.

2. **iNLTK Headline Dataset**: This dataset consists of Marathi news article headlines categorized into three classes: entertainment, sports, and state. It contains 12,092 records, with 9,672 for training, 1,210 for testing, and 1,210 for validation. The average length of a record is 7 words.

To ensure accuracy, I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **IndicNLP News Article Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Divyanshu Kakwani, Anoop Kunchukuttan, Satish Golla, Avik Bhattacharyya, Mitesh M Khapra, and Pratyush Kumar. *Indicnlpsuite: Monolingual corpora, evaluation benchmarks and pre-trained multilingual language models for Indian languages*. Findings of EMNLP, 2020.

- For the **iNLTK Headline Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gaurav Arora. *inltk: Natural language toolkit for Indic languages*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.12534, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
