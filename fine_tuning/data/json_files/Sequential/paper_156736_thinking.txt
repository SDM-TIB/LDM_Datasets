To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Combination Model for Time Series Prediction using LSTM via Extracting Dynamic Features Based on Spatial Smoothing and Sequential General Variational Mode Decomposition" by Jianyu Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or analysis.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that the authors might have used to validate their proposed methods. This section often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include dataset descriptions.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsection titled **3.1 Datasets**. Here, the authors describe how they constructed their datasets for the experiments. They mention using a market sales time series of 1000 points as a window with a length of 100 to form the corresponding trajectory matrix. This indicates that the dataset is related to market sales data.

The authors also specify that they used sales volume data from a certain online store from May 5th, 2000, to April 6th, 2003. This is a crucial detail that helps identify the dataset.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors mention any additional datasets or provide further details about the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The citations are essential for proper attribution and for readers to locate the datasets.

1. **Market Sales Time Series Dataset**: The dataset consists of sales volume data from a certain online store from May 5th, 2000, to April 6th, 2003. The citation for this dataset is not explicitly provided in the paper, so I will note that it is based on the authors' own data collection.

2. **Beer Sales Dataset**: The authors mention using the monthly beer sales volume of Steel Australia as a research object. The citation for this dataset is also not explicitly provided, but it is important to note that it is a publicly available dataset.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the necessary citations for each dataset, even if they are based on the authors' own data collection or publicly available datasets.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are included.
