To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-Linguistic Syntactic Evaluation of Word Prediction Models" by Aaron Mueller et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets introduced by the authors. The abstract mentions the introduction of **CLAMS (Cross-Linguistic Assessment of Models on Syntax)**, which is a syntactic evaluation suite for various languages. This indicates that CLAMS is a key dataset to focus on.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe CLAMS in detail, including its purpose and the languages it covers. They mention that CLAMS includes subject-verb agreement challenge sets for **English, French, German, Hebrew, and Russian**. This confirms that CLAMS is indeed a dataset of interest.

I will also check the **results** and **discussion** sections to see if the authors provide any additional insights or variations of the dataset used in their experiments. They discuss the performance of language models on the CLAMS dataset, which reinforces its significance.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide separate citations for CLAMS since it is a new dataset introduced by the authors themselves. However, I will note that the authors reference the original work that inspired the construction of CLAMS, specifically the work by Marvin and Linzen (2018), which is crucial for understanding the context of CLAMS.

The citation for the foundational work is:
> Marvin, R., & Linzen, T. (2018). Targeted syntactic evaluation of language models. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 1192â€“1202). Association for Computational Linguistics.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and the relevant citations. The key dataset extracted from this paper is:

1. **CLAMS (Cross-Linguistic Assessment of Models on Syntax)**: A syntactic evaluation suite for monolingual and multilingual models, including challenge sets for subject-verb agreement in English, French, German, Hebrew, and Russian.

The citation for the foundational work that inspired CLAMS is also noted for completeness.

After this, I will prepare the dataset entry for CLAMS, ensuring that it is ready for any further processing or review.
