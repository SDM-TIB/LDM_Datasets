To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic detection of microsleep episodes with deep learning" by Alexander Malafeev et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions analyzing MWT data from 76 patients, which indicates that there is a dataset involved. The introduction further elaborates on the need for objective evaluation of sleepiness and mentions the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) as a method used in the study.

Next, I will look into the **Materials and Methods** section, specifically the **Data** subsection. Here, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used for their analysis. They state that MWT data from 76 patients with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) were analyzed, including EEG, EOG, and video recordings. This section confirms the existence of a dataset and provides context about its contents.

The authors also mention that the data is available in a Zenodo repository, which is crucial for citation purposes. I will note the specific link provided for accessing the dataset.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the dataset:

1. **MWT Dataset**: This dataset consists of recordings from 76 patients, including EEG, EOG, and video recordings. The data was used for training, validation, and testing of the deep learning algorithms developed in the study.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference their own previous work that discusses the MWT data and its scoring criteria, which is essential for proper citation.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Malafeev, A., Hertig-Godeschalk, A., Skorucak, J., Achermann, P., Mathis, J., & Schreier, D. R. (2020). Automatic detection of microsleep episodes with feature-based machine learning. *Sleep*, 43(1), zsz225. DOI: 10.1093/sleep/zsz225.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is critical for proper acknowledgment in any further research or applications.

In conclusion, I will prepare the dataset entry with the necessary details and citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
