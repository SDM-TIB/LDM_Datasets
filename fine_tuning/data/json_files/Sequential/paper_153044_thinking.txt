To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-objective Optimization" by Kaiwen Li, Tao Zhang, and Rui Wang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setups section** to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. This section typically contains information about the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any specific configurations used during the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention two types of instances used for testing: **Euclidean instances** and **Mixed instances**. I will note the details provided about these instances, such as their dimensions and how they are generated.

For the **Euclidean instances**, the authors describe them as commonly used test instances for solving the multi-objective traveling salesman problem (MOTSP). They mention that the first cost is defined by the distance between the real coordinates of two cities, while the second cost is defined by another set of virtual coordinates.

For the **Mixed instances**, the authors explain that these instances have a three-dimensional input structure, where the first cost function is based on the Euclidean distance, and the second cost function is defined by a one-dimensional input representing the altitude of the cities.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or papers that are referenced in relation to the datasets used in the experiments. This is crucial for providing proper attribution.

The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

1. For the **Euclidean instances**:
   > Reinelt, G. (1991). *TSPLIB: A traveling salesman problem library*. ORSA Journal on Computing, 3(4), 376-384.

2. For the **Mixed instances**:
   > Lust, T., & Teghem, J. (2010). *The multiobjective traveling salesman problem: A survey and a new approach*. In Advances in Multi-Objective Nature Inspired Computing (pp. 119-141). Springer.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited according to the findings in the paper. This will allow for a structured representation of the datasets used in the research.
