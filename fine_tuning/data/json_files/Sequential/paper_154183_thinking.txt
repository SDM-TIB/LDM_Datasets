To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatial-Temporal Block and LSTM Network for Pedestrian Trajectories Prediction" by Fan Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on two public datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they refer to two datasets: **ETH** and **UCY**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and the specific scenes they encompass.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the datasets as follows:
1. **ETH Dataset**: This dataset includes two scenes named ETH and HOTEL, which consist of real-world human trajectories with rich human-human interaction scenarios.
2. **UCY Dataset**: This dataset includes three scenes named ZARA1, ZARA2, and UNIV, also featuring real-world human trajectories.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **ETH Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pellegrini, S., Ess, A., Schindler, K., & Van Gool, L. (2009). You’ll never walk alone: Modeling social behavior for multi-target tracking. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 261–268.

- For the **UCY Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lerner, A., Chrysanthou, Y., & Lischinski, D. (2007). Crowds by example. In Computer Graphics Forum, volume 26, pages 655–664.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its full citation. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or reference.
