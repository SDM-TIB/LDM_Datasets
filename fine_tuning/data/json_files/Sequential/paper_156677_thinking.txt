To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AraSpell: A Deep Learning Approach for Arabic Spelling Correction" by Mahmoud Salhab and Faisal Abu-Khzam, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their models on "more than 6.9 Million Arabic sentences," which suggests a significant dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Methodology section**, specifically **section 3.1 (Data)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention using the **Arabic Wikipedia 2021 dump**, which contains 711,230 articles in various domains. This is a clear indication of a dataset that is central to their research.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Arabic Wikipedia dataset. However, since the dataset is a publicly available dump, it may not have a formal citation like a typical research paper. Instead, I will note the source as the Kaggle link provided in the paper.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> Arabic Wikipedia 2021 dump. Available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/z3rocool/arabic-wikipedia-dump-2021

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Arabic Wikipedia 2021 dump**: This dataset consists of 711,230 articles in various domains, which were used for training the spelling correction models.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have a complete record of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for any further processing or review.
