To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Temporal Graph Neural Network for Cyber Attack Detection and Localization in Smart Grids" by Seyed Hamed Haghshenas et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I will need to look deeper into the methodology and results for specific dataset information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of measurement data in smart grids and mention that they will evaluate their model using data generated from simulations of power system states and attack scenarios. This indicates that there may be specific datasets used for these simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsection titled "Data Generation and Data Processing." Here, the authors mention that the time-series power system measurements are obtained by running power flow simulations in MATPOWER 7.0 on the IEEE 118 bus system. This is a crucial piece of information as it identifies the dataset used for their experiments.

The authors specify that they vary load demands according to a load pattern obtained from the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO). This indicates that the dataset is not only based on the IEEE 118 bus system but also incorporates real-world load patterns from NYISO.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics based on the datasets generated, confirming that the datasets are indeed used for evaluating the proposed model.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **IEEE 118 Bus System**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > IEEE 118-Bus System, Illinois Center for a Smarter Electric Grid (ICSEG), https://icseg.iti.illinois.edu/ieee-118-bus-system/, accessed July 15, 2022.

2. **NYISO Load Data**: The citation for the load data is:
   > New York Independent System Operator, https://www.nyiso.com/load-data, accessed September 9, 2022.

With these citations, I have successfully identified and documented the datasets used in the research paper. I will now prepare to format this information according to the required structure for further processing.
