To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accelerating Distributed Deep Learning using Lossless Homomorphic Compression" by Haoyu Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions empirical validation across diverse DNN models, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors describe the models and datasets used for testing their algorithm. In this section, they mention four models: NCF, LSTM, VGG19, and BERT-base, along with the datasets associated with each model:

1. **ml-25m Dataset**: Used for the NCF model, which is a recommendation system.
2. **GBW Dataset**: Used for the LSTM model, which is focused on language modeling.
3. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: Used for the VGG19 model, which is for image classification.
4. **SQuAD Dataset**: Used for the BERT-base model, which is for question answering.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the experiments.

- For the **ml-25m Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS), 5(4):1â€“19, 2015.

- For the **GBW Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ciprian Chelba, Tomas Mikolov, Mike Schuster, Qi Ge, Thorsten Brants, Philipp Koehn, and Tony Robinson. *One Billion Word Benchmark for Measuring Progress in Statistical Language Modeling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.3005, 2013.

- For the **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For the **SQuAD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ Questions for Machine Comprehension of Text*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.05250, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
