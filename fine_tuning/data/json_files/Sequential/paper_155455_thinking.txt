To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Biometric Signature Verification Using Recurrent Neural Networks" by Ruben Tolosana et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors used the **BiosecurID database** for their experiments, which is a clear indication that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look into **section III (On-Line Signature Database)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the **BiosecurID database**. They mention that it consists of 400 users, with each user providing 16 original signatures and 12 skilled forgeries across 4 acquisition sessions. This section gives me the necessary details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm that the **BiosecurID database** is indeed the dataset used for the experimental work. The authors explicitly state that they used the first 300 users for development and the remaining 100 users for evaluation, which further validates the dataset's relevance.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the **BiosecurID database**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> J. Fierrez, J. Galbally, J. Ortega-Garcia, et al. "BiosecurID: A Multimodal Biometric Database." *Pattern Analysis and Applications*, vol. 13, no. 2, pp. 235â€“246, May 2010.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **BiosecurID Database**: A comprehensive dataset used for on-line signature verification, consisting of 400 users, each providing 16 original signatures and 12 skilled forgeries across 4 acquisition sessions.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
