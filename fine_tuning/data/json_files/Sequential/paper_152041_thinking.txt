To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Drug-Drug Interaction Extraction from Biomedical Text Using Long Short Term Memory Network" by Sunil Kumar Sahu and Ashish Anand, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset description sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of a dataset for evaluating the proposed models, which suggests that there is a specific dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. They state that they obtained the dataset from the **SemEval-2013 Task-9** challenge, which is a clear indication of the dataset's name and source.

In this section, the authors describe the dataset as containing annotated sentences from two sources: **Medline abstracts** and the **DrugBank database**. They provide details about the types of interactions annotated in the dataset, which include Advice, Effect, Mechanism, and Interaction (Int). This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's purpose and structure.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the SemEval-2013 Task-9 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the SemEval-2013 Task-9 dataset, the citation is:
  > I. Segura-Bedmar, P. Martínez, and M. Herrero Zazo. *SemEval-2013 Task 9: Extraction of Drug-Drug Interactions from Biomedical Texts (DDIExtraction 2013)*. In Second Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (*SEM*), Volume 2: Proceedings of the Seventh International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2013), pages 341–350, Atlanta, Georgia, USA, June 2013. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
