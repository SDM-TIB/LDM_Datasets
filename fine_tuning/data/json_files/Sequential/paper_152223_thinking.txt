To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Turing Machines: Convergence of Copy Tasks" by Janez Ale≈°, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections discussing the copy and repeat copy tasks**. The abstract provides a general overview of the research focus but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the introduction and subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the paper discusses the architecture of Neural Turing Machines (NTMs) and their training challenges, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned. I will continue to the sections that detail the experiments.

In the **Copy Task section**, the author describes the training of an NTM on sequences of random binary vectors of length 8, with sequence lengths chosen randomly between 1 and 20. However, this does not refer to an external dataset but rather to the generation of synthetic data for the experiments.

Next, in the **Repeat Copy Task section**, the author mentions training the NTM on sequences of 6-bit vectors with specific lengths and repetition numbers. Similar to the previous section, this describes the experimental setup rather than a dataset sourced from an external repository.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the author did not utilize any publicly available datasets for their experiments. Instead, they generated synthetic data for the copy and repeat copy tasks. Therefore, there are no datasets to cite or document in this case.

Since no datasets are mentioned, I will not need to look for citations or references for datasets. The focus of the paper is on the methodology and results of the experiments conducted with generated data rather than on external datasets.

In conclusion, I will summarize that this paper does not provide any datasets for citation, as the experiments were conducted using synthetic data generated by the authors themselves.
