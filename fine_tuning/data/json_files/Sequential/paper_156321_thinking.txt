To extract datasets from the research paper titled "1D-CapsNet-LSTM: A Deep Learning-Based Model for Multi-Step Stock Index Forecasting" by Cheng Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the model's performance is evaluated on real-world stock market indices, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section (Section 4)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Data description and preprocessing)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention four stock indices: **S&P 500, DJIA, IXIC, and NYSE**. This is a clear indication of the datasets utilized in their study.

I will then look for the **full citations** for these datasets in the **References section**. Since these datasets are commonly used financial indices, I will provide the standard references for them:

1. **S&P 500**: 
   > Standard & Poor's. (n.d.). S&P 500 Index. Retrieved from https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-500/

2. **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)**: 
   > Dow Jones & Company. (n.d.). Dow Jones Industrial Average. Retrieved from https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/dow-jones-industrial-average/

3. **Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC)**: 
   > Nasdaq. (n.d.). Nasdaq Composite Index. Retrieved from https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/indexes/ixic

4. **New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)**: 
   > New York Stock Exchange. (n.d.). NYSE Composite Index. Retrieved from https://www.nyse.com/index

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
