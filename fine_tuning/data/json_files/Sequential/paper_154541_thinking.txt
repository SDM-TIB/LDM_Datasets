To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sparse Attention Guided Dynamic Value Estimation for Single-Task Multi-Scene Reinforcement Learning" by Jaskirat Singh and Liang Zheng, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Experiments," "Evaluation," or "Datasets."** In this paper, the authors mention using the **OpenAI ProcGen environments** for their experiments. I will need to gather details about these environments, including their characteristics and how they are utilized in the study.

In the **Results section**, the authors provide performance metrics for various environments, which confirms that these environments are indeed datasets used for evaluation. I will note down the names of these environments as they are crucial for the dataset extraction.

Now, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets. The paper mentions the **OpenAI ProcGen environments** and cites the following reference for it:

- For **OpenAI ProcGen**, the citation is:
  > Cobbe, K., Klimov, O., Hesse, C., Kim, T., and Schulman, J. *Quantifying generalization in reinforcement learning*. In International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 1282â€“1289, 2019.

Additionally, the paper references the **AI2-THOR environment** for visual navigation tasks, which is another dataset of interest. The citation for this environment is:
- For **AI2-THOR**, the citation is:
  > Kolve, E., Mottaghi, R., Han, W., VanderBilt, E., Weihs, L., Herrasti, A., Gordon, D., Zhu, Y., Gupta, A., and Farhadi, A. *AI2-THOR: An interactive 3D environment for visual AI*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1712.05474, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as they are critical for proper attribution and further research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and future use.
