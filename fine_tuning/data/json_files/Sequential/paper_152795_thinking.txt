To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Real-time Eyeblink Detection in The Wild: Dataset, Theory and Practices" by Guilei Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that a new dataset called **HUST-LEBW** has been established, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** in the paper, which is often where authors describe the datasets they have created or used. In this case, I find that the authors provide a detailed description of the **HUST-LEBW dataset** in **Section III**. Here, they mention that it consists of 673 eyeblink video samples, including 381 positive samples and 292 negative samples, captured from unconstrained movies.

I will also check for any comparisons made with existing datasets in the **related work** section. The authors reference several other datasets, including **ZJU**, **Eyeblink8**, **Talking face**, **Silesian5**, and **Researchers’ nights**. Each of these datasets is discussed in terms of their limitations compared to HUST-LEBW.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The citations can typically be found in the **References section**. For the datasets referenced, I will compile the following citations:

1. **HUST-LEBW Dataset**:

   > K. Radlak, M. Bozek, and B. Smolka. *Silesian deception database: Presentation and analysis*. In Proc. ACM Multimodal Deception Detection Workshop (MDDW), 2015, pp. 29–35.

6. **Researchers’ Nights Dataset**:
   > “Researchers’ night,” https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/european-researchers-night_en.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets discussed in the paper, which can be useful for further research or analysis.
