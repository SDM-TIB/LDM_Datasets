To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A New Amharic Speech Emotion Dataset and Classification Benchmark" by Ephrem Afele Retta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the **Amharic Speech Emotion Dataset (ASED)**, which is a key dataset in this paper. It describes the dataset's characteristics, including the number of recordings and emotions covered.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (ASED Dataset for Amharic)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the ASED dataset. This section outlines the dataset's structure, including the number of recordings, the dialects represented, and the emotions classified. It also discusses the methodology used for data collection and quality control, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's reliability.

In **subsection 2.1 (Existing SER datasets)**, the authors mention two well-known datasets used in their experiments: **RAVDESS** and **EMO-DB**. I will extract details about these datasets, including their characteristics and how they compare to ASED.

1. **Amharic Speech Emotion Dataset (ASED)**: This dataset includes 2,474 sound samples recorded by 65 native speakers of Amharic, covering four dialects and five emotions (neutral, fearful, happy, sad, and angry). The dataset is freely available for download.

2. **RAVDESS (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song)**: This dataset contains audio and video recordings of English sentences spoken by 24 actors in eight emotions. The total number of utterances is 1,440, and the recordings are three seconds long at a sampling rate of 48 kHz.

3. **EMO-DB (Berlin Emo-DB)**: This dataset consists of audio recordings of German sentences made by ten speakers in seven different emotions. It contains about 535 sentences, with recordings lasting two to three seconds at a sampling rate of 16 kHz.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Amharic Speech Emotion Dataset (ASED)**, the citation is:
  > Ephrem Afele Retta, Eiad Almekhlaﬁ, Richard Sutcliffe, Mustafa Mhamed, Haider Ali, Jun Feng. *A New Amharic Speech Emotion Dataset and Classification Benchmark*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].

- For **RAVDESS**, the citation is:
  > Livingstone, S. R., & Russo, F. A. (2018). *The Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS): A dynamic, multimodal set of facial and vocal expressions in North American English*. PloS one, 13(5), e0196391.

- For **EMO-DB**, the citation is:
  > Burkhardt, F., Paeschke, A., Rolfes, M., Sendlmeier, W. F., & Weiss, B. (2005). *A database of German emotional speech*. In Ninth European Conference on Speech Communication and Technology.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or downstream processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant information and citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper.
