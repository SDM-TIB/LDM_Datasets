To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revisiting Attention Weights as Explanations from an Information Theoretic Perspective" by Bingyang Wen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and the section titled "Tasks and Datasets"** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the "Tasks and Datasets" section is likely to contain specific details about the datasets used in the experiments.

In the **"Tasks and Datasets" section**, the authors mention several datasets used for different NLP tasks. I will list these datasets along with their descriptions:

1. **SST (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis, containing 3,034 training samples and 3,321 test samples. The task is to classify the sentiment as positive or negative.
   
2. **IMDB (Internet Movie Database)**: This dataset consists of 12,500 training samples and 12,500 test samples, also for sentiment analysis.

3. **ADR Tweets (Adverse Drug Reaction Tweets)**: This dataset includes 14,446 training samples and 1,939 test samples, focusing on identifying mentions of adverse drug reactions in tweets.

4. **20 Newsgroups**: This dataset has 716 training samples and 710 test samples, where the task is to classify news articles into categories like hockey or baseball.

5. **AG News**: This dataset contains 30,000 training samples and 30,000 test samples, used to classify news articles into world or business categories.

6. **Diabetes (MIMIC)**: This dataset has 6,381 training samples and 1,353 test samples, focusing on determining whether a patient is diabetic.

7. **Anemia (MIMIC)**: This dataset includes 1,847 training samples and 3,251 test samples, used to classify the type of anemia (Chronic or Acute).

8. **bAbI (Task 1 / 2 / 3)**: This dataset consists of 10,000 samples, where each sample contains a triplet of paragraph-question-answer.

9. **SNLI (Stanford Natural Language Inference)**: This dataset is used for natural language inference tasks, containing pairs of sentences with labels indicating entailment, contradiction, or neutrality.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality over a Sentiment Treebank*.

- For **Diabetes (MIMIC)**, the citation is:
  > Alistair E.W. Johnson et al. *MIMIC-III, a Freely Accessible Critical Care Database*. Scientific Data, 3:160035, 2016.

- For **Anemia (MIMIC)**, the citation is the same as for Diabetes since both datasets are part of the MIMIC-III database.

- For **bAbI**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective references from the paper.
