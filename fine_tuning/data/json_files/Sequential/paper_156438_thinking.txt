To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Forecasting Lithium-Ion Battery Longevity with Limited Data Availability: Benchmarking Different Machine Learning Algorithms" by Hudson Hilal and Pramit Saha, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the comparison of machine learning algorithms for battery cycle life prediction, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Material and Methods)**, where the authors describe their dataset. They mention that their dataset is based on the information collected and published along with Severson et al. (2019). This indicates that the dataset is derived from a previously published source, which is crucial for citation.

In this section, the authors provide details about the dataset, stating that it contains extensive information about 124 LiFePO4 batteries tested from maximum capacity until they reached 80% of their initial charge/discharge capacity. The dataset includes various features such as temperature, internal resistance, discharge capacity, and charge capacity.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the dataset mentioned, which is based on the work of Severson et al. (2019). I will locate this citation in the **References section** of the paper. The citation for the dataset is:

> Severson, K.A., Attia, P.M., Jin, N., Perkins, N., Jiang, B., Yang, Z., Chen, M.H., Aykol, M., Herring, P.K., Fraggedakis, D., et al. (2019). Data-driven prediction of battery cycle life before capacity degradation. *Nature Energy*, 4, 383–391.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extracted from the paper:

1. **Dataset Name**: LiFePO4 Battery Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset containing extensive information about 124 LiFePO4 batteries tested from maximum capacity until they reached 80% of their initial charge/discharge capacity, including features such as temperature, internal resistance, discharge capacity, and charge capacity.
   - **Citation**: Severson, K.A., Attia, P.M., Jin, N., Perkins, N., Jiang, B., Yang, Z., Chen, M.H., Aykol, M., Herring, P.K., Fraggedakis, D., et al. (2019). Data-driven prediction of battery cycle life before capacity degradation. *Nature Energy*, 4, 383–391.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper referencing.
