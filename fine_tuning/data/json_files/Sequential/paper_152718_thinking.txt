To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SNAS: Stochastic Neural Architecture Search" by Sirui Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments that follow.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3), as this is where datasets are typically discussed in detail. In this section, the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for their architecture search and evaluation. They describe it as a basic dataset for image classification, consisting of 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. This is a clear indication that CIFAR-10 is a primary dataset used in their experiments.

Additionally, the authors mention evaluating their architecture on **ImageNet**, which is another significant dataset in the field of computer vision. They describe the mobile setting for ImageNet, indicating that the size of the input images is 224 × 224 and that the model's multiply-add operations are restricted to be less than 600M. This suggests that ImageNet is also a crucial dataset for their evaluation.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

2. For the **ImageNet dataset**, the citation is:
   > Christian Szegedy, Wei Liu, Yangqing Jia, Pierre Sermanet, Scott Reed, Dragomir Anguelov, Dumitru Erhan, Vincent Vanhoucke, and Andrew Rabinovich. *Going deeper with convolutions*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 1–9, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
