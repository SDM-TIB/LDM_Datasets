To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Big Data Analytics for Network Level Travel Time Prediction with Hierarchical LSTM" by Tianya Terry Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a "large-scale travel time dataset from Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS)," indicating that this dataset is crucial for the research. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of travel time data for predictive modeling, which suggests that the dataset will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **case study** sections. In the **case study** section, the author describes the dataset collected from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS), specifying that it covers a four-year period from August 1st, 2017, to October 31st, 2021, at a 5-minute time frequency. This section provides essential details about the dataset, including its temporal scope and the geographical area it covers (the San Francisco Bay Area).

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The PeMS dataset is widely recognized, and I will ensure to provide the correct citation for it. The citation for the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) is as follows:

- **Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS)**:
  > California Department of Transportation. *Performance Measurement System (PeMS)*. [Online]. Available: https://pems.dot.ca.gov/

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the PeMS dataset is the primary dataset used in this research.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset, including its name, description, and citation, ensuring that the citation is formatted correctly and is complete. This will allow for proper attribution and facilitate reproducibility in future research.

In summary, the steps I followed include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction to identify the dataset.
2. Locating the case study section for detailed information about the dataset.
3. Finding the full citation in the references section.
4. Compiling the dataset information for documentation.

This structured approach ensures that I accurately extract and document the dataset used in the research paper.
