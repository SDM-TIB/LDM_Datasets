To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bootstrapping Named Entity Recognition in E-Commerce with Positive Unlabeled Learning" by Hanchu Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors present a novel dataset of product descriptions, which suggests that there is a specific dataset being used for their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details. The introduction discusses the challenges of Named Entity Recognition (NER) in e-commerce and mentions the lack of annotated datasets, hinting at the significance of the dataset they created.

In **section 3 (Dataset)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset they used for evaluation. They mention that they utilized the **Amazon review dataset** (McAuley et al., 2015), which is a collection of product metadata and customer reviews from Amazon. They specify that they focused on entries in the Electronics/Computers subcategory and created a dataset of 24,272 training documents and 100 test documents, which were manually annotated.

I will also check the **References section** to gather the full citation for the Amazon review dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Julian J. McAuley, Christopher Targett, Qinfeng Shi, and Anton van den Hengel. *Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes*. Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, 2015.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format. The dataset extracted is:

1. **Amazon Review Dataset**: A dataset containing product metadata and customer reviews from Amazon, specifically focusing on the Electronics/Computers subcategory. It includes 24,272 training documents and 100 test documents, which were manually annotated.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the full citation for the dataset included in my output. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their citations as required.
