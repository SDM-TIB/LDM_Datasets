To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An End-to-end Video Text Detector with Online Tracking" by Hongyuan Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on existing video text benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section A (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **ICDAR 2013 Video**: This dataset consists of 28 videos lasting from 10 seconds to 1 minute, with 13 videos used for training and 15 for testing. The frame sizes range from 720 x 480 to 1280 x 960.

2. **Minetto Dataset**: This dataset includes 5 videos set in outdoor scenes, with a frame size of 640 x 480, and all videos are used for testing.

3. **YVT**: This dataset contains 30 videos, with 15 for training and 15 for testing. It differs from the other two datasets as it includes web videos, and the frame size is 1280 x 720.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **ICDAR 2013 Video**, the citation is:
  > D. Karatzas, F. Shafait, S. Uchida, M. Iwamura, L. G. i Bigorda, S. R. Mestre, J. Mas, D. F. Mota, J. A. Almazan, and L. P. De Las Heras. *ICDAR 2013 Robust Reading Competition*. In ICDAR, pages 1484–1493. IEEE, 2013.

- For **Minetto Dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Minetto, N. Thome, M. Cord, N. J. Leite, and J. Stolfi. *Snoopertrack: Text detection and tracking for outdoor videos*. In ICIP, pages 505–508. IEEE, 2011.

- For **YVT**, the citation is:
  > P. X. Nguyen, K. Wang, and S. Belongie. *Video text detection and recognition: Dataset and benchmark*. In WACV, pages 776–783. IEEE, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
