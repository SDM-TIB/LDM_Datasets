To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncertainty estimation in spatial interpolation of satellite precipitation with ensemble learning" by Georgia Papacharalampous et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their methods to "large precipitation datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets and application)**, as this section is likely to contain the most comprehensive information about the datasets used in the study. In this section, the authors mention that they sourced data from four databases, which are summarized in Table 2. I will extract the names and descriptions of these datasets:

1. **Global Historical Climatology Network monthly database, version 2 (GHCNm)**: This dataset contains gauge-measured precipitation data.
2. **Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN)**: This dataset provides remote-sensed precipitation data.
3. **GPM Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals late precipitation L3 1 day 0.1 degree x 0.1 degree V06 (IMERG)**: Another source of remote-sensed precipitation data.
4. **Amazon Web Services Terrain Tiles (AWSTT)**: This dataset includes elevation data.

I will also check **Table 3** for the sources of these databases and **Table 4** for data retrieval details, which will help me compile the necessary citations.

Now, I will look for the full citations for each dataset in the **References section**. The citations I need to extract are:

- For **GHCNm**:
  > Peterson, T.C., & Vose, R.S. (1997). An overview of the Global Historical Climatology Network temperature database. *Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society*, 78(12), 2837–2849. https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0477(1997)078<2837:AOOTGH>2.0.CO;2.

- For **PERSIANN**:
  > Hsu, K.-L., Gao, X., Sorooshian, S., & Gupta, H.V. (1997). Precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks. *Journal of Applied Meteorology*, 36(9), 1176–1190. https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0450(1997)036<1176:PEFRSI>2.0.CO;2.

- For **IMERG**:
  > Huffman, G.J., Stocker, E.F., Bolvin, D.T., Nelkin, E.J., & Tan, J. (2019). GPM IMERG Late Precipitation L3 1 day 0.1 degree x 0.1 degree V06. Edited by Andrey Savtchenko, Greenbelt, MD, Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC). https://doi.org/10.5067/GPM/IMERGDL/DAY/06.

- For **AWSTT**: There is no specific citation provided in the references, but it is mentioned that the data is accessible via Amazon Web Services.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study.
