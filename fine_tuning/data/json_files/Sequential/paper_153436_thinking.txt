To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Device-Circuit-Architecture Co-Exploration for Computing-in-Memory Neural Accelerators" by Weiwen Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of datasets for evaluating their proposed framework, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in this section.

Next, I will examine the **experimental setup section** (which is often where datasets are detailed) to find explicit mentions of the datasets used in their experiments. In this paper, the authors refer to two datasets: **CIFAR-10** and **Nuclei**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their purpose and any specific characteristics mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

For the **Nuclei dataset**, the citation is:
> N. Kumar, R. Verma, S. Sharma, S. Bhargava, A. Vahadane, and A. Sethi. *A dataset and a technique for generalized nuclear segmentation for computational pathology*. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, vol. 36, no. 7, pp. 1550â€“1560, 2017.

Now that I have the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation.

This process ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research and provide proper references for future readers or researchers interested in the same datasets.
