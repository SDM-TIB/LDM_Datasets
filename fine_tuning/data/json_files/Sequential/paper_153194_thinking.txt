To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Show Me Your Account: Detecting MMORPG Game Bot Leveraging Financial Analysis with LSTM" by Kyung Ho Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention the dataset used for training and testing the model.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of MMORPGs and the challenges of bot detection, which may hint at the data sources used. I will look for any specific references to datasets or data collection methods.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the **Data Collection** subsection, where the authors describe the dataset they used. Here, they mention that they collected gameplay data from **Aion**, a popular MMORPG, during the first week of May 2010. This is a crucial piece of information as it identifies the primary dataset used in their research.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors provide further details about the Aion dataset, such as its size or specific characteristics.

After identifying the dataset, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the Aion dataset. Since the dataset is derived from gameplay logs of Aion, I will look for the original source or any relevant publications that describe the dataset in detail.

The citation for the Aion dataset is not explicitly provided in the paper, but I can reference the game itself as follows:
> NCSOFT. *Aion*. [Online]. Available: https://www.aiononline.com/

Now, I will compile the dataset entry based on the information gathered, ensuring to include the full citation for the Aion dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ready for review or further processing.
