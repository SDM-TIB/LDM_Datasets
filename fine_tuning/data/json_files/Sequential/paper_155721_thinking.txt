To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heat Demand Forecasting with Multi-Resolutional Representation of Heterogeneous Temporal Ensemble" by Satyaki Chatterjee et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a forecasting framework for heat demand and mentions using real-world data acquired from Denmark, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors describe the data used for their experiments. They mention using **meter-level heat consumption data from 2015 to 2018** from a Danish utility, which is crucial for identifying the dataset.

In this section, the authors also specify that the data is aggregated at a zonal level and includes **weather data** represented by feel-like temperature, along with information on public holidays and the day of the week. This indicates that there are multiple components to the dataset.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets directly, but it does reference other works that may have used similar data or methodologies.

1. **Meter-level heat consumption data**: While the paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset, it is implied that it is sourced from a Danish utility. Therefore, I will note it as:
   > Meter-level heat consumption data from a Danish utility (2015-2018).

2. **Weather data**: The authors mention using feel-like temperature data, but again, no specific citation is provided. I will note it as:
   > Weather data (feel-like temperature) from the same Danish town.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for these datasets, I will summarize the information as follows:

- **Dataset 1**: Meter-level heat consumption data from a Danish utility (2015-2018).
- **Dataset 2**: Weather data (feel-like temperature) from the same Danish town.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I highlight the importance of the datasets used in the research while acknowledging the lack of formal citations in the paper. This will help in understanding the context and sources of the data utilized in the study.
