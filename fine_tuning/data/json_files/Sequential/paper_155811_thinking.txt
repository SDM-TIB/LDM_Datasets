To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning-based Vulnerability Detection in Binary Executables" by Andreas Schaad and Dominik Binder, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize a dataset with **50,651 samples of vulnerable code** in LLVM Intermediate Representation, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data Gathering and Preprocessing)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they mention the **Software Assurance Reference Dataset (SARD)**, which contains over **170,000 programs** across various programming languages, and the **Juliet Suite**, which consists of **64,099 artificially generated test cases**. This section provides essential details about the datasets used in their experiments.

In addition, I will look for any references to other datasets or sources that may have been used in their analysis. The authors reference the SARD dataset multiple times, indicating its significance in their work.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Software Assurance Reference Dataset (SARD)**, the citation is:
   > P. E. Black et al., "SARD: Thousands of Reference Programs for Software Assurance," *J. Cyber Secur. Inf. Syst. Tools Test. Tech. Assur. Softw. Dod Softw. Assur. Community Pract.*, vol. 2, no. 5, 2017.

2. For the **Juliet Suite**, the citation is:
   > T. Boland and P. E. Black, "Juliet 1.1 C/C++ and Java Test Suite," *Computer*, vol. 45, no. 10, pp. 88â€“90, 2012.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, which is essential for any further analysis or replication of the study.
