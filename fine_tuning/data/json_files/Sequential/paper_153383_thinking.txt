To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepVS: An Efficient and Generic Approach for Source Code Modeling Usage" by Yasir Hussain et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on "ten real-world open-source software systems," which suggests that these systems may be the datasets of interest.

Next, I will focus on **section 13 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the codebase used for training and testing their method. They mention that the codebase consists of ten open-source software systems: **ant, cassandra, db40, jgit, poi, batik, antlr, itext, jts, and maven**. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including the total number of code tokens and the vocabulary size.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the codebase anticipated in references [6] and [7]. I will extract the full citations for these references to ensure I have the correct attribution for the datasets.

The citations are as follows:

- For the dataset referenced in [6]:
  > Abram Hindle, Earl T Barr, Zhendong Su, Mark Gabel, and Premkumar Devanbu. *On the naturalness of software*. In 2012 34th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE), pages 837–847. IEEE, 2012.

- For the dataset referenced in [7]:
  > Anh Tuan Nguyen, Trong Duc Nguyen, Hung Dang Phan, and Tien N Nguyen. *A deep neural network language model with contexts for source code*. In 2018 IEEE 25th International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER), pages 323–334. IEEE, 2018.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Codebase of ten open-source software systems**: This dataset includes the following systems: ant, cassandra, db40, jgit, poi, batik, antlr, itext, jts, and maven, containing over 13 million code tokens.

Next, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and accuracy in the dataset extraction process.
