To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rain-Code Fusion: Code-to-code ConvLSTM Forecasting Spatiotemporal Precipitation" by Takato Yasuno et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their method to a dam region using hourly precipitation data from 2006 to 2019, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Applied Results)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention using the **Radar/Rain gauge Analysed Precipitation data** provided by the Japan Meteorological Agency, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's characteristics.

In this section, the authors specify that they used approximately **127,000 hours of hourly precipitation data** from 2006 to 2019, focusing on the rainy season from May to October. They also mention that the data is updated every 10 minutes with a spatial resolution of 1 km, which provides important details about the dataset's temporal and spatial resolution.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Radar/Rain gauge Analysed Precipitation data. The citation is as follows:
> Japan Meteorological Agency: Radar/Rain gauge-Analysed Precipitation data, web accessed at 30 September 2020, https://www.jma.go.jp/en/kaikotan/.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Radar/Rain gauge Analysed Precipitation data**: This dataset includes hourly precipitation data from 2006 to 2019, covering approximately 127,000 hours of data during the rainy season in Japan. The data is updated every 10 minutes and has a spatial resolution of 1 km.

With this information, I will prepare to create structured entries for the dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Radar/Rain gauge Analysed Precipitation data as it is essential for proper referencing.

After compiling the dataset entries, I will ensure they are ready for review or further processing.
