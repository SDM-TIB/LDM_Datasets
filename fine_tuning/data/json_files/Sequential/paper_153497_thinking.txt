To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Economy Statistical Recurrent Units for Inferring Nonlinear Granger Causality" by Saurabh Khanna and Vincent Y. F. Tan, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of a time series prediction model for inferring Granger causality, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction may provide more context or specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors describe multiple experiments, including simulations based on the **Lorenz-96 model**, **VAR simulations**, and **in silico estimation of brain connectivity using BOLD signals**. Each of these experiments likely corresponds to specific datasets.

1. **Lorenz-96 Simulations**: The authors mention generating time series measurements according to the Lorenz-96 model, which is a well-known model in climate science. However, they do not provide a specific dataset citation here, as the data is generated through simulations.

2. **VAR Simulations**: Similar to the Lorenz-96, the VAR simulations involve generating time series data based on a linear VAR model. Again, no specific dataset citation is provided, as the data is synthetically created.

3. **In Silico Estimation of Brain Connectivity**: The authors refer to simulated BOLD signals for estimating brain connectivity, specifically mentioning the **Sim-3.mat** file shared at the University of Oxford's FMRIB website. This is a clear dataset reference.

Next, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the following:

- For the **Lorenz-96 model**, they cite Schneider et al. (2017) for the model dynamics.
- For the **Sim-3 dataset**, they cite Smith et al. (2011) for the generation of the BOLD time series measurements.

Now, I will compile the dataset information along with their full citations:

1. **Lorenz-96 Simulations**: 
   - Citation: 
     > Schneider, T., Lan, S., Stuart, A., & Teixeira, J. (2017). Earth system modeling 2.0: A blueprint for models that learn from observations and targeted high-resolution simulations. *Geophysical Research Letters*, 44(24), 12,396–12,417.

2. **Sim-3 Dataset**: 
   - Citation: 
     > Smith, S. M., Miller, K. L., Salimi-Khorshidi, G., Webster, M., Beckmann, C. F., Nichols, T. E., Ramsey, J. D., & Woolrich, M. W. (2011). Network modelling methods for FMRI. *NeuroImage*, 54(2), 875–891.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are structured correctly for any further processing or review. This systematic approach allows me to accurately extract and cite datasets from the research paper.
