The dataset consists of 100k images and 1 million question/answer pairs and has been carefully calibrated to avoid exploitable biases. Over 850k of these questions are unique. Images are high quality 3D Blender renders of scenes containing geometric objects of various shapes, sizes, colors, textures, and materials.",
