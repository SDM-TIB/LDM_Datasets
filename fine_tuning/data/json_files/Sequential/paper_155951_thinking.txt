To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine Learning based prediction of Glucose Levels in Type 1 Diabetes Patients with the use of Continuous Glucose Monitoring Data" by Jakub J. Dylag, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) data, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper. The introduction will provide context on the importance of the datasets in the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or data acquisition, which is often included in research papers. In this case, I will focus on **section 3.1 (Data Acquisition)**, where the author discusses the identification of suitable CGM datasets for Type 1 Diabetes. Here, I will look for specific dataset names and descriptions.

In **section 3.1**, the author lists several datasets, including:

1. **CITY Dataset**: This dataset is highlighted as featuring data from 153 patients over a period of 22 months. It is specifically noted for its relevance to the study, as it includes data collected from similar CGM devices (Dexcom G4/G5/G6).

2. **OhioT1DM Dataset**: This dataset includes 8 weeks of data collected from 12 anonymous Type 1 Diabetes patients, which is also mentioned in the context of other studies.

The author also references other datasets in a tabular format, but the focus will be on the two datasets that are most relevant to the study's methodology.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **CITY dataset**, the citation is:
> Jaeb Center for Health Research. (n.d.). Continuous Glucose Monitoring on Glycemic Control in Adolescents and Young Adults With Type 1 Diabetes Dataset - PUBLIC STUDY WEBSITES. Available at: https://public.jaeb.org/datasets/diabetes

For the **OhioT1DM dataset**, the citation is:
> Marling, C., & Bunescu, R. (2020). The OhioT1DM Dataset for Blood Glucose Level Prediction: Update 2020. Available at: http://smarthealth.cs.ohio.edu/bglp/OhioT1DM-dataset-paper.pdf

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations for future use or analysis.
