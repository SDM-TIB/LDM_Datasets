To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Designing and Interpreting Probes with Control Tasks" by John Hewitt and Percy Liang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of probes and control tasks but does not specify datasets. The introduction discusses the context of the research but does not provide dataset names either.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 3.3 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they state that they use the **Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset** for their tasks, which is a well-known dataset in natural language processing.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Penn Treebank dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Mitchell P Marcus, Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz, and Beatrice Santorini. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2):313â€“330, 1993.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset**: This dataset is used for part-of-speech tagging and dependency edge prediction tasks. It is a large annotated corpus of English.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset.
