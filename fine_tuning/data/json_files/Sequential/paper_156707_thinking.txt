To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Multi-scale Quaternion CNN and BiGRU with Cross Self-attention Feature Fusion for Fault Diagnosis of Bearing" by Huanbai Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on **three public datasets (CWRU, MFPT, and Ottawa)**, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for the study.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors provide a clear description of each dataset:

1. **CWRU Dataset**: This dataset includes 12k Drive End Bearing Fault Data and Normal Baseline Data, collected under various load conditions and fault states. It is used for a twelve-classification task.

2. **MFPT Dataset**: Collected by the Society for Mechanical Failure Prevention Technology, this dataset includes three healthy states and is used for a 3-classification task.

3. **Ottawa Dataset**: This dataset contains vibration signals of rolling bearings collected under different load conditions, used for a 5-classification task.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **CWRU Dataset**:
  > Wade A. Smith and Robert B. Randall. *Rolling element bearing diagnostics using the case western reserve university data: A benchmark study*. Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 64:100â€“131, 2015.

- For **MFPT Dataset**:
  > Huan Huang. *Bearing vibration data under time-varying rotational speed conditions*, 2019.

- For **Ottawa Dataset**:
  > Dean Lee, Vincent Siu, Rick Cruz, and C. J. Yetman. *Convolutional neural net and bearing fault analysis*, 2016.

Now that I have the dataset names and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
