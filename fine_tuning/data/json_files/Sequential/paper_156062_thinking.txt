To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quran Recitation Recognition using End-to-End Deep Learning" by Ahmad Al Harere and Khloud Al Jallad, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a public dataset called **Ar-DAD**, which is a significant clue that I need to explore further.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **dataset** sections, specifically section 3, where the authors provide detailed information about the **Ar-DAD dataset**. Here, they describe it as a large dataset containing 15,810 audio clips from 30 reciters reading 37 chapters of the Holy Quran, along with additional audio clips from imitators and text files. This section provides essential details about the dataset's structure and content.

I will also check the **results** and **discussion** sections to see if the authors mention any other datasets used for comparison or validation. However, the paper primarily focuses on the **Ar-DAD dataset** for their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the **Ar-DAD dataset** from the references section. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **Ar-DAD Dataset**: 
  > M. Lataifeh and A. Elnagar, “Ar-DAD: Arabic diversified audio dataset,” *Data Brief*, vol. 33, p. 106503, Dec. 2020, doi: 10.1016/j.dib.2020.106503.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the **Ar-DAD dataset** in the specified format, ensuring that it is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
