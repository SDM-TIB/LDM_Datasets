To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VIBE: Video Inference for Human Body Pose and Shape Estimation" by Muhammed Kocabas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a "large-scale motion capture dataset (AMASS)" for training, which indicates that this dataset is significant for the research. I will also look for any other datasets mentioned in the introduction or experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of estimating 3D human motion from video and highlight the importance of training data. They specifically mention leveraging the AMASS dataset, which I will note down.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors provide a detailed summary of the datasets used for training and evaluation. They mention several datasets:

1. **AMASS**: This dataset is used for adversarial training to obtain real samples of 3D human motion. It is crucial for the model's performance.
2. **3DPW**: This dataset is used for evaluation and contains in-the-wild videos with SMPL body pose captured using IMU sensors.
3. **MPI-INF-3DHP**: A multi-view dataset used for training and evaluation, primarily indoors.
4. **Human3.6M**: Another dataset used for training, which contains 3D annotations in a controlled environment.
5. **PennAction**: This dataset includes video sequences with 2D human keypoint annotations.
6. **InstaVariety**: A dataset curated from Instagram videos with 2D annotations.
7. **PoseTrack**: A benchmark for multi-person pose estimation and tracking in videos.

I will now check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The citations I will extract are:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries along with their full citations for clarity and completeness. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their sources from the paper.
