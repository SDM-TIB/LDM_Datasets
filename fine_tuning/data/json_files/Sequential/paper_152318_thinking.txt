To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Incorporating Copying Mechanism in Sequence-to-Sequence Learning" by Jiatao Gu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets, indicating that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors describe their empirical studies. Here, they mention three specific tasks that utilize different datasets:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset is generated with transformation rules and is used to study the behavior of COPYNET on handling simple patterns. The authors describe how they created this dataset, including the number of rules and instances.

2. **LCSTS Dataset**: This is a large-scale dataset for short text summarization, collected from news media on Sina Weibo. The authors provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of pairs and the scoring system used for evaluation.

3. **Dialogue Dataset**: The authors describe how they built a simple dialogue dataset based on collected patterns from Baidu Tieba, detailing the number of instances used for training and testing.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **LCSTS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Baotian Hu, Qingcai Chen, and Fangze Zhu. *LCSTS: A Large Scale Chinese Short Text Summarization Dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.05865, 2015.

The synthetic dataset does not have a formal citation since it is generated by the authors for the purpose of their study. The dialogue dataset is also created by the authors and does not have a separate citation.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: A dataset created with transformation rules for studying COPYNET's performance on simple patterns. No formal citation.
  
2. **LCSTS Dataset**: A large-scale dataset for short text summarization collected from Sina Weibo.
  
3. **Dialogue Dataset**: A dataset built from patterns collected from Baidu Tieba for single-turn dialogue tasks. No formal citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
