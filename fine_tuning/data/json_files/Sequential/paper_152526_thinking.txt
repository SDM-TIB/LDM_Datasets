To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Bimodal network architectures for automatic generation of image annotation from text" by Mehdi Moradi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates a need for large annotated datasets in medical image analysis, which suggests that datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their work. Here, I will find two datasets mentioned:

1. **Dataset 1**: This dataset is from Indiana University Hospital and includes chest X-ray images from approximately 3500 unique patients. The authors performed image-level annotations on a subset of 494 images, focusing on findings such as cardiomegaly and nodules. 

2. **Dataset 2**: This is the Chest-Xray14 dataset released by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which contains 112,120 frontal-view X-rays, with various findings labeled. The authors note that this dataset does not include image-level annotations.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Dataset 1**, the citation is:
  > Demner-Fushman, D., et al. "Preparing a collection of radiology examinations for distribution and retrieval." *Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association* 23(2), 304â€“310 (2015).

- For **Dataset 2**, the citation is:
  > Wang, X., Peng, Y., Lu, L., Lu, Z., Bagheri, M., Summers, R.M. "ChestX-ray8: Hospital-scale chest x-ray database and benchmarks on weakly-supervised classification and localization of common thorax diseases." *CoRR* abs/1705.02315 (2017), http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02315.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset, including their descriptions and full citations.
