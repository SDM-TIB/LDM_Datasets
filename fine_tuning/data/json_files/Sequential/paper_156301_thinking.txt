To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Students Success Modeling: Most Important Factors" by Sahar Voghoei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study involves a deep learning model trained with features extracted from the records of 60,822 postsecondary students. This suggests that a dataset related to these students is central to the research.

Next, I will examine the **data gathering** section, which provides detailed information about the sources of data used in the study. The authors mention three primary resources from which data was extracted:

1. **Banner**: An Oracle-based ERP software used to gather various types of student data, including personal, family, pre-college, financial, and academic data. The paper states that this data includes information on 60,822 postsecondary students from 2006 to 2019.

2. **Brightspace (D2L)**: A learning management system from which data on students' online engagement and performance was collected. This includes grades, attendance, and activity indices.

3. **National Student Clearinghouse (NSC)**: A nonprofit organization that provides comprehensive enrollment and graduation data for students across U.S. institutions. This data helps track students' educational paths, including transfers and graduation statuses.

In the **resources** subsection, the authors specify that the data from these three sources was stored in a central database, which is crucial for the model's training.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** for these datasets in the **references section**. While the datasets themselves may not have formal citations like traditional datasets, I will note the relevant papers or sources that describe the datasets:

- For **Banner**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is a widely used ERP system in educational institutions. I will note that it is commonly referenced in educational data research.

- For **Brightspace (D2L)**, similarly, the citation is not provided, but it is a well-known learning management system used in many educational settings.

- For **National Student Clearinghouse (NSC)**, the citation is also not explicitly mentioned, but it is a recognized source for student enrollment and graduation data in the U.S.

Since the paper does not provide specific citations for these datasets, I will summarize the information as follows:

1. **Dataset from Banner**: Data extracted from the Banner ERP system, covering 60,822 postsecondary students from 2006 to 2019. (No formal citation available)

2. **Dataset from Brightspace (D2L)**: Data collected from the Brightspace learning management system, including student engagement and performance metrics. (No formal citation available)

3. **Dataset from National Student Clearinghouse (NSC)**: Comprehensive enrollment and graduation data for students across U.S. institutions. (No formal citation available)

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the datasets and their descriptions, ensuring that I clearly indicate the lack of formal citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper.
