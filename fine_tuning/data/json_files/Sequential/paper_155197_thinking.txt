To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parameter Efficient Deep Probabilistic Forecasting" by Olivier Sprangers et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on "four real-world datasets," which indicates that I should look for these datasets in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section (Section 4)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention four datasets:

1. **Electricity Dataset**: This dataset contains hourly electricity consumption data for 370 clients over a 3-year period, with the task of forecasting electricity consumption for the next 24 hours based on the previous 7 days.

2. **Traffic Dataset**: This dataset consists of 15 months of hourly data describing the occupancy rate of different car lanes in the San Francisco Bay Area. The goal is to forecast the occupancy rate for the next 24 hours based on the previous 7 days.

3. **Favorita Dataset**: Sourced from Kaggle, this dataset includes 4 years of daily sales data for store-product combinations from a retail chain. The task is to forecast log sales for the next 30 days based on the previous 90 days.

4. **WebTraffic Dataset**: This dataset contains 145,000 time series of daily Wikipedia pageviews from 2015 to 2017. The objective is to forecast the number of pageviews for the next 30 days based on the previous 90 days.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Electricity Dataset**, the citation is:
  > UCI Machine Learning Repository: Electricity Load Diagrams 2011-2014 Data Set, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ElectricityLoadDiagrams20112014.

- For the **Traffic Dataset**, the citation is:
  > UCI Machine Learning Repository: PEMS-SF Data Set, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/PEMS-SF.

- For the **Favorita Dataset**, the citation is:
  > CorporaciÃ³n Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting, https://kaggle.com/c/favorita-grocery-sales-forecasting.

- For the **WebTraffic Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Web Traffic Time Series Forecasting, https://kaggle.com/c/web-traffic-time-series-forecasting.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
