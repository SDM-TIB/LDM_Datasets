To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sensor-based Data Acquisition via Ubiquitous Device to Detect Muscle Strength Training Activities" by Elizabeth Wianto et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it mentions data from 25 participants performing nine types of motion, it does not specify any dataset names. 

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any existing datasets or provide context for their own data collection. The introduction discusses the importance of physical activity and the use of smartphones for Human Activity Recognition (HAR), but it does not mention specific datasets.

Moving on to the **methods section**, I will look for details about the data collection process. The authors describe collecting data from 25 students performing nine specific motions, but they do not refer to any pre-existing datasets. Instead, they mention that the data was collected using a custom application developed for this study.

In the **results section**, the authors provide statistics about the collected data, including the total number of rows and average rows per student. They mention that a total of 69,088 rows of data were gathered, but again, there are no references to external datasets.

Finally, I will check the **discussion and conclusion sections** for any mention of datasets. The authors discuss the implications of their findings and the potential for future work, but they do not cite any datasets.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the data collected by the authors themselves and does not reference any external datasets, I will note that the dataset created for this study is unique to their research. The dataset consists of sensor data from the participants performing strength training activities, but it does not have a formal citation like established datasets.

In summary, I will document the dataset created in this study as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Custom dataset for muscle strength training activities
- **Description**: Data collected from 25 participants performing nine types of strength training motions using smartphone sensors.
- **Citation**: Wianto, E., Toba, H., Malinda, M., & Chen, C.-H. (2023). Sensor-based Data Acquisition via Ubiquitous Device to Detect Muscle Strength Training Activities. *AHFE 2023: Vol. XX, 2023*. doi: 10.54941/ahfeXXXX.

Since there are no other datasets referenced in the paper, I will conclude my extraction process here. The focus remains on the unique dataset generated by the authors for their specific research purposes.
