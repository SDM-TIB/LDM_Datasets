To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Negation detection in Dutch clinical texts: an evaluation of rule-based and machine learning methods" by Bram van Es et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used the **Erasmus Medical Center Dutch Clinical Corpus** for their experiments, which is a strong indication that this is a primary dataset.

Next, I will examine the **data section** (section 2) in detail, as it is likely to contain specific information about the datasets used. In this section, the authors describe the **Erasmus Medical Center Dutch Clinical Corpus (DCC)**, which consists of 7,490 Dutch anonymized medical records annotated with medical terms and contextual properties. They also mention that after excluding certain records, they were left with 5,365 usable records containing 12,551 annotated medical terms.

I will also check the **methodology section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors reference any other datasets used for comparison or validation purposes. However, the primary focus remains on the DCC.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the Erasmus Medical Center Dutch Clinical Corpus. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Afzal, Zubair et al. (2014). “ContextD: an algorithm to identify contextual properties of medical terms in a Dutch clinical corpus”. In: BMC bioinformatics 15.1, pp. 1–12.

This citation is crucial for proper attribution and should be included in the dataset extraction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation in a structured format for clarity.

In summary, the key steps I will take are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial dataset mentions.
2. Focus on the data section for detailed descriptions of the datasets.
3. Check the methodology for any additional datasets.
4. Retrieve the full citation from the references section.
5. Compile the dataset information clearly and accurately.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I extract the relevant datasets from the paper effectively and provide the necessary citations.
