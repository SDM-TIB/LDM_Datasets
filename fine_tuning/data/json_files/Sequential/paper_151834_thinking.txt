To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention, Learn to Solve Routing Problems!" by Wouter Kool et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses improvements in heuristics for combinatorial optimization problems, which suggests that datasets may be involved, particularly in the context of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and other routing problems.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention several routing problems, including the TSP, Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), Orienteering Problem (OP), and Prize Collecting TSP (PCTSP). I will look for specific datasets or benchmarks associated with these problems.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors refer to datasets generated for the TSP, VRP, OP, and PCTSP. They mention that instances for these problems are generated uniformly at random in the unit square, which indicates that they may not be using pre-existing datasets but rather creating their own for the purpose of their experiments.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** for any relevant papers or datasets that may have been used as benchmarks or comparisons. The authors reference several foundational works related to the TSP and VRP, but they do not cite specific datasets since they generated their own instances.

Here are the key datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)**: Instances are generated uniformly at random in the unit square. The authors do not provide a specific dataset citation since they created their own instances.

2. **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)**: Similar to TSP, instances are generated uniformly at random. Again, no specific dataset citation is provided.

3. **Orienteering Problem (OP)**: Instances are generated with nodes sampled uniformly at random in the unit square, with prizes assigned based on different distributions. No specific dataset citation is provided.

4. **Prize Collecting TSP (PCTSP)**: Instances are generated with nodes sampled uniformly at random in the unit square, with prizes and penalties assigned. No specific dataset citation is provided.

Since the authors generated their own datasets for the experiments, I will note that while specific dataset citations are not available, the methodology for generating the instances is described in detail in the paper.

Now, I will summarize the findings and prepare to format them according to the required structure, ensuring to highlight that the datasets are generated instances rather than pre-existing datasets with formal citations.
