To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-Time Monitoring and Forecasting of COVID–19 Cases using an Adjusted Holt–based Hybrid Model embedded with Wavelet–based ANN" by Agniva Das and Kunnummal Muralidharan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on COVID-19 case forecasting, which suggests that relevant datasets will be discussed.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Real-Time Monitoring & Forecasting)**, specifically **subsection 2.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the data sources used for their analysis. Here, they mention that they sourced data from **covid19india.org**, a crowdfunded operation that aggregates data from various official sources. This indicates that the dataset is related to COVID-19 cases in India.

The authors specify that they considered data for the total confirmed cases in India and six hotspot states: **Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh**. They mention that the dataset includes daily confirmed cases from **March 14, 2020, to January 10, 2021**, with a total of **272 observations** for each state.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is sourced from a website rather than a traditional publication, I will note the citation as follows:

- For the dataset from **covid19india.org**, the citation is:
  > covid19india.org. *COVID-19 India Data*. Accessed January 10, 2021. URL: https://covid19india.org.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, including the name, description, and citation, ensuring that the citation is complete and properly formatted.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
