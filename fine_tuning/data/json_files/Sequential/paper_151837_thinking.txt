To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Dynamic Memory Networks for Object Tracking" by Tianyu Yang and Antoni B. Chan, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed tracker is evaluated on "large scale datasets OTB and VOT," which indicates that these datasets are likely important for the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors state that they evaluate their tracker on three datasets: **OTB-2013**, **OTB-2015**, and **VOT-2016**. I will note down these datasets and any relevant details provided about them.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

1. **OTB-2013 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Wu, Y., Lim, J., & Yang, M.H. (2013). *Online Object Tracking: A Benchmark*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 2411-2418.

2. **OTB-2015 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Wu, Y., Lim, J., & Yang, M.H. (2015). *Object Tracking Benchmark*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI), 37(9), 1834-1848.

3. **VOT-2016 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Kristan, M., Leonardis, A., Matas, J., & Felsberg, M. (2016). *The Visual Object Tracking VOT2016 Challenge Results*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) Workshop on Visual Object Challenge.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that I provide accurate citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
