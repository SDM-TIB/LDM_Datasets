To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of the Forget Gate" by Jos van der Westhuizen and Joan Lasenby, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed model, JANET, outperforms the standard LSTM on multiple benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments and results section**. In this section, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is widely known for handwritten digit recognition and is referenced as having been used in the experiments. 

2. **Permuted MNIST (pMNIST) Dataset**: This dataset is described as a variant of the MNIST dataset where the pixels of each image have been permuted, creating longer-term dependencies.

3. **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset**: The authors describe how they extracted single heartbeats from this dataset for their experiments.

Now, I will verify the details of each dataset mentioned in the paper to ensure accuracy. The paper provides sufficient context and details about how each dataset was used, including the number of samples and the specific tasks they were applied to.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y. A. (1998). The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

- For the **Permuted MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Arjovsky, M., Shah, A., and Bengio, Y. (2016). Unitary evolution recurrent neural networks. In International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 1120–1128.

- For the **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Moody, G. B., and Mark, R. G. (2001). The impact of the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine, 20(3):45–50.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
