To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "A Novel Deep Parallel Time-Series Relation Network for Fault Diagnosis" by Chun Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed model is validated on four datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiment)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for performance comparison. They explicitly list four datasets:

1. **Tennessee-Eastman (TE) Dataset**: This dataset simulates a real chemical production process and includes one normal state and 20 fault states. The authors reference a source for more details.

2. **KDD-CUP99 Dataset**: This dataset contains 7 million network traffic connection records labeled as normal or attacked data. The authors also provide a reference for additional details.

3. **Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) Dataset**: This dataset simulates a real fuel cell system and includes various fault conditions. The authors describe the features and conditions of this dataset.

4. **Wheelset Bearing Dataset (WHELL)**: This dataset simulates high-speed rail wheelset bearings and includes multiple fault states. The authors provide a brief description of the dataset's features and conditions.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For the **Tennessee-Eastman (TE) Dataset**:
  > Downs, J. J., & Vogel, E. F. (1993). A plant-wide industrial process control problem. *Computers & Chemical Engineering*, 17(3), 245-255.

- For the **KDD-CUP99 Dataset**:
  > Lippmann, R., Haines, J. W., Fried, D. J., Korba, J., & Das, K. (2000). The 1999 DARPA off-line intrusion detection evaluation. *Computer Networks*, 34(4), 579-595.

- For the **PEMFC Dataset**: The paper does not provide a specific citation, but it describes the dataset in detail, indicating that it is based on experimental data collected from a fuel cell system.

- For the **Wheelset Bearing Dataset (WHELL)**: Similar to the PEMFC dataset, the paper describes the dataset but does not provide a specific citation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets where available. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or reference.
