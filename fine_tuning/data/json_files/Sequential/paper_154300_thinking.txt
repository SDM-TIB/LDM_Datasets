To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parallel Waveform Synthesis Based on Generative Adversarial Networks with Voicing-Aware Conditional Discriminators" by Ryuichi Yamamoto et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed method and its performance but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Experimental setup)**, where the authors describe the data used for their experiments. Here, they mention that the experiments utilized four phonetically and prosodically rich speech corpora recorded by two female and two male Japanese professional speakers. They specify that each corpus included 5,000 utterances, with a breakdown of training, validation, and evaluation samples.

The paper does not provide specific names for these datasets, but it does indicate that they are speaker-dependent and consist of recordings from professional speakers. This suggests that the datasets are likely proprietary or not publicly available, which is common in speech synthesis research.

Since the paper does not provide full citations for these datasets, I will note that the datasets are described in terms of their characteristics (e.g., number of utterances, speaker information) but lack formal citations. 

I will also check the **References section** to see if any of the cited works correspond to the datasets used. However, the references primarily discuss methods and previous works rather than specific datasets.

In summary, I will document the following:

1. **Dataset Description**: Four phonetically and prosodically rich speech corpora recorded by two female and two male Japanese professional speakers, each containing 5,000 utterances.
2. **Citation**: Since specific dataset names and citations are not provided in the paper, I will note that there are no formal citations available for these datasets.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I highlight the lack of specific dataset citations as a key point.
