To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating Natural Language Inference Chains" by Vladyslav Kolesnyk et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. In the abstract, the authors discuss using the **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus** for their experiments, which indicates that this is a key dataset.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.1 (Entailment Generation)**, where the authors describe how they created their entailment generation dataset by filtering the SNLI corpus for sentence pairs of the entailment class. They provide specific details about the dataset sizes: a training set of 183,416 sentence pairs, a development set of 3,329 pairs, and a test set of 3,368 pairs. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides quantitative details.

In the **experiments section**, the authors reiterate their use of the SNLI corpus, which further solidifies its importance in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SNLI corpus. The relevant citation is:

- For the **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus**, the citation is:
  > Sam Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 632â€“640, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the SNLI corpus, ensuring that the full citation is included as required. This will allow for proper documentation and referencing in any subsequent analysis or processing.
