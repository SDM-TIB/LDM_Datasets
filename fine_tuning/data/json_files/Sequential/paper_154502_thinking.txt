To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Coloring the Black Box: What Synesthesia Tells Us about Character Embeddings" by Katharina Kann and Mauro M. Monsalve-Mercado, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's aims and methods, which may include dataset references.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (A Character Similarity Task)**, where the authors describe their character similarity task. Here, they mention using a dataset collected by Witthoft et al. (2015), which consists of letter-to-color mappings from 4269 synesthetes. This dataset is crucial for understanding how characters are perceived by synesthetes and is likely to be one of the primary datasets used in their analysis.

I will also check **section 5 (Models and Tasks)**, where the authors describe the tasks and datasets used for training different character embeddings. They mention training on the **wikitext-103 dataset** for language modeling, which is another important dataset for their experiments.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations I need to retrieve are:

1. For the dataset from Witthoft et al. (2015):
   > Nathan Witthoft, Jonathan Winawer, and David M. Eagleman. *Prevalence of learned grapheme-color pairings in a large online sample of synesthetes*. PLoS One, 10(3), 2015.

2. For the wikitext-103 dataset:
   > Alec Radford, Karthik Narasimhan, Tim Salimans, and Ilya Sutskever. *Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training*. OpenAI, 2018. (Note: This citation is often associated with the dataset, but the original dataset is from the Wikitext project.)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for understanding the study's context and findings.
