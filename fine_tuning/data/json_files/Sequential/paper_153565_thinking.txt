To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fingerprint Spoof Detection: Temporal Analysis of Image Sequence" by Tarang Chugh and Anil K. Jain, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a database of live and spoof frames, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about the datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of fingerprint recognition and mentions the use of a large-scale fingerprint database, which reinforces the idea that datasets are central to the research.

I will then focus on the **experimental results** section, particularly **section 3.1 (Database)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they specify that they utilized:

1. **Live Frames Dataset**: This dataset consists of 26,650 live frames collected from 685 subjects, with a total of 1,333 unique fingers.

2. **Spoof Frames Dataset**: This dataset includes 32,910 spoof frames created from 7 different spoof materials, with 14 variants.

The paper also mentions that the live and spoof datasets were collected from two sources, including a Government Controlled Test (GCT-3) conducted at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHUAPL).

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the IARPA ODIN program, which is relevant for the dataset collection. However, it does not provide a specific citation for the datasets themselves, as they are likely proprietary or part of the research conducted by the authors.

Since the datasets are derived from the authors' own experiments and are not publicly available, I will note that the datasets are described in detail but do not have formal citations like publicly available datasets.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

- **Live Frames Dataset**: 26,650 live frames from 685 subjects (1,333 unique fingers).
- **Spoof Frames Dataset**: 32,910 spoof frames from 7 spoof materials (14 variants).

While I cannot provide formal citations for these datasets, I will acknowledge their significance in the context of the research and note that they were collected as part of the IARPA ODIN program.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
