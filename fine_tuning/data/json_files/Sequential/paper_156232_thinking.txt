To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Effects of Daily News Sentiment on Stock Price Forecasting" by R. Satish Srinivas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the creation of a news database consisting of almost half a million news articles and the collection of stock price information over a timeline of 3.7 years. This indicates that there are significant datasets involved.

Next, I will examine **section III (Data and Methodology)**, which is likely to provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, the authors describe their data collection process, including stock price data collected from Yahoo Finance for the NIFTY50 stocks and news articles scraped from the Economic Times. 

1. **NIFTY50 Stock Price Data**: The paper states that stock price data was collected for the NIFTY50 stocks from January 2019 to August 2022, totaling 904 data points. This dataset is crucial for the analysis and modeling performed in the study.

2. **Economic Times News Articles**: The authors mention scraping almost half a million news articles from the Economic Times over the same timeline. This dataset is essential for the sentiment analysis conducted in the research.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but I can infer the following:

- For the **NIFTY50 Stock Price Data**, the citation can be attributed to Yahoo Finance as the source of the stock price data:
  > Yahoo Finance. "NIFTY 50 Index." [Online]. Available: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ENSEI?p=%5ENSEI

- For the **Economic Times News Articles**, the citation can be attributed to the Economic Times as the source of the news articles:
  > Economic Times. "Economic Times News Archive." [Online]. Available: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/archive.cms

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
