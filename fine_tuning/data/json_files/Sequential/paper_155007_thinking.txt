To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HELIX: A data-driven characterization of Brazilian land snails" by Marcelo N. Almeida et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves a dataset of shells used for characterizing Brazilian land snails, which suggests that a specific dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges of identifying land snails and mention the importance of shells in this process. They introduce the HELIX dataset, which is explicitly stated to contain shells gathered from the Juiz de Fora/MG area. This is a clear indication that the HELIX dataset is the primary dataset used in the study.

In the **methods section**, the authors provide detailed information about how the HELIX dataset was curated, including the collection process, the number of instances, and the species represented. They mention that the dataset includes 518 instances labeled as five different species of land snails, which further confirms the significance of the HELIX dataset.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the HELIX dataset. The paper states that the HELIX dataset is available at a specific URL (zenodo.org/record/5500215), which I will include in the citation.

The citation for the HELIX dataset is as follows:
> Almeida, M. N., Oliveira, R. A. de, Olmes, L., Semaan, G. S., de Oliveira, D., Santos, L., & Bedo, M. (2021). HELIX: A data-driven characterization of Brazilian land snails. In Proceedings of the XXXVI Brazilian Symposium on Databases (SBBD’21) – Short Papers. Available at: https://zenodo.org/record/5500215.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and organized representation of the HELIX dataset, ready for further analysis or integration into a larger dataset repository.
