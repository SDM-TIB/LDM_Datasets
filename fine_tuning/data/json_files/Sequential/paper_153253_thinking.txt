To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bi-Directional ConvLSTM U-Net with Densely Connected Convolutions" by Reza Azad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed model is evaluated on three datasets related to medical image segmentation, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **DRIVE Dataset**: This dataset is used for retinal blood vessel segmentation and consists of 40 color retina images, with 20 for training and 20 for testing. The authors provide details about the image size and the number of patches generated for training.

2. **ISIC 2018 Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for skin lesion segmentation and includes 2594 dermoscopy images. The authors specify how the dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets, along with the preprocessing steps taken.

3. **Lung Segmentation Dataset**: This dataset is introduced in the Lung Nodule Analysis (LUNA) competition and consists of 2D and 3D CT images. The authors describe how they split the dataset into training and testing sets and provide details about the image size.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **DRIVE Dataset**:

- For the **ISIC 2018 Dataset**:
  > N. C. Codella, D. Gutman, M. E. Celebi, B. Helba, M. A. Marchetti, S. W. Dusza, A. Kalloo, K. Liopyris, N. Mishra, H. Kittler, et al.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
