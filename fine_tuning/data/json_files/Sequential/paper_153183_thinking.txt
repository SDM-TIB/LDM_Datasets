To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LSTM Based Music Generation System" by Sanidhya Mangal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's objectives but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for a system that can generate music using existing music data but do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **methodology section**, where they describe the model and its training process. Here, they mention using MIDI files as the format for the dataset, which is crucial for the model's training.

Next, I will look for any specific references to datasets in the **implementation section**. The authors state that they used a "large and varied dataset" with different variations in the structural composition of musical notes, specifically mentioning the use of MIDI files. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name or citation here.

In the **results section**, the authors refer to training their model on "Pop Music" MIDI files, but again, they do not provide a specific dataset name. They do mention a future intention to test their model on the "Million Song Dataset," which is a well-known dataset in the music information retrieval community.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **MIDI files**: While the authors do not cite a specific dataset for the MIDI files, they refer to a general use of MIDI files for music generation. Therefore, I will note that MIDI files are used but will not provide a citation since no specific dataset is mentioned.

2. **Million Song Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Bertin-Mahieux, T., Whitman, B., Ellis, D. P. W., & Lamere, P. (2011). *The Million Song Dataset*. In Proceedings of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR), 2011.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets identified in the paper, ensuring to include the full citations where applicable. 

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
