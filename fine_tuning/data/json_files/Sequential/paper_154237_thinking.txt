To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-Attentive Tacotron: Robust and Controllable Neural TTS Synthesis" by Jonathan Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the work, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments and the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets, particularly in sections that detail the experimental setup.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they trained their models on a proprietary dataset with 66 speakers across four English accents, totaling 354 hours of data. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find out if it has a specific name or if it is referred to in a particular way.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to datasets. The authors may reference other works that describe the datasets they used, which is crucial for providing full citations.

From my review, I identify the following datasets:

1. **LibriTTS**: This dataset is mentioned as a benchmark for evaluating the robustness of the models. It is derived from LibriSpeech and consists of 354K sentences from various train subsets.

   Full citation:
   > Zen, H., Dang, V., Clark, R., Zhang, Y., Weiss, R. J., Jia, Y., Chen, Z., and Wu, Y. *LibriTTS: A Corpus Derived from LibriSpeech for Text-to-Speech*. In Proceedings of Interspeech, pages 1526â€“1530, 2019.

2. **Web-long**: This dataset consists of 100K long sentences mined from the web, which includes a small amount of irregular text.

   Full citation:
   > The dataset is not explicitly cited in the references, but it is described in the context of the experiments. If it were to be referenced, it would need to be cited according to the source from which it was derived.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
