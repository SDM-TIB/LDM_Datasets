To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Conversational Shaping for Intelligent Agents" by Piotr Tarasiewicz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses enhancing intelligent conversational agents, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction provides context about the models used but does not mention datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results and Discussions)**, where the authors evaluate their methods. Here, they mention using the **Daily Dialogue dataset** for their experiments. This is a crucial finding, as it indicates a specific dataset used in their research.

I will then look for a detailed description of the **Daily Dialogue dataset** within the paper. The authors reference it in the context of evaluating their models, but I need to ensure I have the complete citation. I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Daily Dialogue dataset.

Upon reviewing the references, I find the citation for the Daily Dialogue dataset:
> Li, Y., Su, H., Shen, X., Li, W., Cao, Z., and Niu, S. (2017). Dailydialog: A manually labelled multi-turn dialogue dataset.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Daily Dialogue Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed models in the paper. It is described as a manually labeled multi-turn dialogue dataset.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset and its citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or processing.
