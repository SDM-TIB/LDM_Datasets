To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RACE: Retrieval-Augmented Commit Message Generation" by Ensheng Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions conducting experiments on a "large public dataset with five programming languages," which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide details about the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they specifically mention the **MCMD dataset**. I will extract the relevant details about this dataset, including its purpose, size, and the programming languages it covers.

The authors describe the MCMD dataset as follows:
- It collects commits from the top-100 starred repositories on GitHub, filtering out redundant and noisy messages.
- The dataset contains approximately 450,000 commits for each of the five programming languages: Java, C#, C++, Python, and JavaScript.
- Each commit includes the code diff, commit message, repository name, and timestamp.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MCMD dataset. The authors cite the following paper for the dataset:
> Wei Tao, Yanlin Wang, Ensheng Shi, Lun Du, Shi Han, Hongyu Zhang, Dongmei Zhang, and Wenqiang Zhang. *On the evaluation of commit message generation models: An experimental study*. In ICSME, 2021.

With this information, I will summarize the dataset details and ensure to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that captures all the necessary information, including the dataset name, description, and citation.
