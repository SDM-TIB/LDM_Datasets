To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Character-Based Text Classification using Top Down Semantic Model for Sentence Representation" by Zhenzhou Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the model was applied across **seven different datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, particularly **subsection 4.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a table (Table 1) listing the datasets used in their experiments. This table includes the following datasets:

1. **AG News**: A dataset with 120,000 training samples and 7,600 classes, with an average text length of 38 words.
2. **Sogou News**: Contains 450,000 training samples and 60,000 test samples, with an average text length of 566 words.
3. **DBP**: Comprises 560,000 training samples and 70,000 test samples, with an average text length of 48 words.
4. **Yelp Polarity**: Includes 560,000 training samples and 38,000 test samples, with an average text length of 133 words.
5. **Yelp Full**: Contains 650,000 training samples and 50,000 test samples, with an average text length of 134 words.
6. **Amazon Full**: A larger dataset with 3,000,000 training samples and 650,000 test samples, with an average text length of 80 words.
7. **Amazon Polarity**: Comprising 400,000 training samples and 2 test samples, with an average text length of 78 words.

I will then look for the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The authors mention that the datasets were prepared by Zhang et al. (2015), which indicates that I should refer to that paper for the complete citation.

The citation for the dataset preparation is:
> Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, and Yann LeCun. *Character-level convolutional networks for text classification*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28: Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems 2015, pp. 649â€“657, 2015.

Now, I will compile the dataset information along with the citations into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its respective citation.

After completing this process, I will have a comprehensive list of datasets used in the paper, along with their full citations, ready for further processing or review.
