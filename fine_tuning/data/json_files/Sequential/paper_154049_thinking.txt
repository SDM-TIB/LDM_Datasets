To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "BAKSA at SemEval-2020 Task 9: Bolstering CNN with Self-Attention for Sentiment Analysis of Code Mixed Text" by Ayush Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data description sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved F1 scores on two datasets, **Hinglish** and **Spanglish**, which suggests that these are the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **data description section (Section 4)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets. They mention that the datasets were provided by the organizers of Task-9 of SemEval 2020, and they include statistics about the training and validation data for both Hinglish and Spanglish. This section confirms the datasets' names and provides context about their use.

The paper states that the **Hinglish dataset** is balanced, while the **Spanglish dataset** is highly unbalanced. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' characteristics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. The paper cites the SemEval-2020 task overview, which is the authoritative source for the datasets used. The citation for the SemEval-2020 Task 9 is:

- For **Hinglish and Spanglish datasets**:
  > Parth Patwa, Gustavo Aguilar, Sudipta Kar, Suraj Pandey, Srinivas PYKL, Björn Gambäck, Tanmoy Chakraborty, Thamar Solorio, and Amitava Das. *Semeval-2020 task 9: Overview of sentiment analysis of code-mixed tweets*. In Proceedings of the 14th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2020), Barcelona, Spain, December. Association for Computational Linguistics.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets:

1. **Hinglish Dataset**: A balanced dataset used for sentiment analysis of code-mixed tweets, containing various sentiment classes (positive, neutral, negative).

2. **Spanglish Dataset**: An unbalanced dataset used for sentiment analysis of code-mixed tweets, also containing multiple sentiment classes.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.
