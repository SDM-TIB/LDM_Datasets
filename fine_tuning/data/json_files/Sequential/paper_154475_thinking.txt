To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Contract Element Extraction Revisited: Letters from Sesame Street" by Ilias Chalkidis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss the datasets**. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to delve deeper into the main body of the paper to find specific datasets.

In **section 3 (Task Definition and Datasets)**, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used for their experiments. I will summarize each dataset based on the details provided in this section:

1. **Contract Header / Preamble**: This dataset consists of contract headers from previous work by Chalkidis et al. It includes instances for identifying contract titles, parties, start dates, and effective dates, with specific counts for training and testing.

2. **Applicable Law**: This dataset focuses on sections of contracts where the governing law and jurisdiction need to be identified. The authors provide the number of training and testing instances for these elements.

3. **Lease Particulars**: This dataset contains sections from lease agreements, detailing various elements such as the address of the leased property, landlord, tenant, start date, effective date, end date, term of the lease, and agreed rent amount, along with their respective instance counts.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are based on the original works referenced in the paper:

- For the **Contract Header / Preamble** and **Applicable Law** datasets, the citation is:
  > I. Chalkidis and I. Androutsopoulos. *A deep learning approach to contract element extraction*. In Proceedings of the 30th International Conference on Legal Knowledge and Information Systems (JURIX), pages 155–164, Luxembourg, 2017.

- For the **Lease Particulars** dataset, the citation is:
  > I. Chalkidis, I. Androutsopoulos, and A. Michos. *Extracting contract elements*. In Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law (ICAIL), pages 19–28, London, UK, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets along with their authoritative references.
