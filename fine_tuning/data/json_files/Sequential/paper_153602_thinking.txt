To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Performance-Oriented Neural Architecture Search" by Andrew Anderson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimentation sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of neural architecture search to keyword spotting in audio, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to this task.

Next, I will focus on the **experimentation section** where the authors describe their methodology. In this section, they mention using the **Google Speech Commands dataset** for their experiments. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized, and I will need to gather more details about it.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **results sections**. Here, the authors provide specifics about the dataset, stating that it contains 65,000 audio samples of 30 keywords, and they selected 10 keywords for their experiments. This information is crucial for accurately describing the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Google Speech Commands dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Pete Warden. *Speech commands: A dataset for limited-vocabulary speech recognition*. CoRR, abs/1804.03209, 2018.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset details:

1. **Google Speech Commands Dataset**: This dataset consists of 65,000 audio samples of 30 keywords, specifically used for keyword spotting tasks. The authors selected 10 keywords for their experiments, and the dataset is publicly available.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is essential for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent work or analysis.
