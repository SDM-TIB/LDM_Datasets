To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Summarization Driven Deep Remote Sensing Image Captioning" by Gencer Sumbul et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset description sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on multiple datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **Section III (Datasets and Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three primary datasets:

1. **Sydney-Captions Dataset**: This dataset consists of 613 images, each with five captions, totaling 3065 captions. The images are of size 500x500 pixels with a spatial resolution of 0.5 meters.

2. **UCM-Captions Dataset**: This dataset includes 2100 aerial images, each with five captions, resulting in a total of 10,500 captions. Each image has a size of 256x256 pixels with a spatial resolution of one foot.

3. **RSICD Dataset**: The RSICD is the largest dataset mentioned, containing 10,921 images with varying spatial resolutions. Each image is described with a different number of captions, leading to a total of 54,605 captions.

Additionally, the authors mention using the **Annotated Gigaword dataset** for the second step of their proposed approach, which consists of nearly 10 million documents.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Sydney-Captions Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **UCM-Captions Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Annotated Gigaword Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Graff, D., Kong, J., Chen, K., & Maeda, K. (2003). English Gigaword. Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
