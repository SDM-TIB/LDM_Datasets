To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Story Cloze Ending Selection Baselines and Data Examination" by Todor Mihaylov and Anette Frank, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses baseline systems for the Story Cloze Test, which suggests that datasets related to this task may be included.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Task description and data construction)**, where the authors describe the evaluation data. They mention that the evaluation data consists of a Dev set and a Test set, each containing 1,871 instances. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used.

The authors also reference the **ROC Stories corpus** (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016a), which consists of around 100,000 crowd-sourced short stories. This corpus is crucial as it is used to generate training data for the Story Cloze task.

In **section 2**, they detail how they constructed the training dataset from the Dev set and the ROC Stories corpus, which further confirms the datasets involved.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **Story Cloze Test**, the citation is:
   > Mostafazadeh, N., Chambers, N., He, X., Parikh, D., Batra, D., Vanderwende, L., Kohli, P., & Allen, J. (2016a). A Corpus and Evaluation Framework for Deeper Understanding of Commonsense Stories. In Proceedings of the 30th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), pages 2398–2404.

2. For the **ROC Stories corpus**, the citation is the same as above since it is part of the same work:
   > Mostafazadeh, N., Chambers, N., He, X., Parikh, D., Batra, D., Vanderwende, L., Kohli, P., & Allen, J. (2016a). A Corpus and Evaluation Framework for Deeper Understanding of Commonsense Stories. In Proceedings of the 30th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), pages 2398–2404.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the names, descriptions, and citations of each dataset. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for future reference or analysis.
