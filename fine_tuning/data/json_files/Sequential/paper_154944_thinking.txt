To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Event2Graph: Event-driven Bipartite Graph for Multivariate Time-series Anomaly Detection" by Yuhang Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three public datasets: SMAP, MSL, and SMD. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for understanding the research findings.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used in their experiments in **section 5 (Experiment)**. They specifically mention:

1. **SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive)**: This dataset is used for anomaly detection in time series data related to soil moisture measurements.
2. **MSL (Mars Science Laboratory)**: This dataset pertains to data collected from the Mars rover, which is also used for anomaly detection.
3. **SMD (Server Machine Dataset)**: This dataset consists of server machine metrics and is utilized for detecting anomalies in server performance.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide additional context about the datasets, including their characteristics and the specific metrics used for evaluation. This information is essential for understanding how the datasets contribute to the research.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are typically formatted according to the publication standards, and I will ensure to capture them accurately. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

- For **SMAP**:
  > NASA. *Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Data*. [Online]. Available: https://smap.jpl.nasa.gov/data/
  
- For **MSL**:
  > NASA. *Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Data*. [Online]. Available: https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/
  
- For **SMD**:
  > Ahmed, M., Mahmood, A. N., and Hu, J. (2016). *Anomaly Detection for Time Series: A Survey*. In Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 2828â€“2837.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
