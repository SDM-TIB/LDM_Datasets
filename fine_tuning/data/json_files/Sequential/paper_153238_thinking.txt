To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling Graph Structure in Transformer for Better AMR-to-Text Generation" by Jie Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimentation sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved significant results on "English AMR benchmark datasets," which indicates that datasets are involved. I need to identify the specific datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experimentation section** (Section 3), where the authors describe their experimental settings. Here, they specifically mention using two datasets: **LDC2015E86** and **LDC2017T10**. I will note these names as they are crucial for the dataset entries.

In the **experimental settings subsection (3.1)**, the authors provide details about the datasets, stating that LDC2015E86 contains 16,833 training AMRs and LDC2017T10 contains 36,521 training AMRs. They also mention that both datasets share development and testing AMRs. This information is essential for describing the datasets.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **LDC2015E86**, the citation is:
  > Banarescu, L., Bonial, C., Cai, S., Georgescu, M., Grifﬁtt, K., Hermjakob, U., Knight, K., Koehn, P., Palmer, M., & Schneider, N. (2013). Abstract meaning representation for sembanking. In Proceedings of the 7th Linguistic Annotation Workshop & Interoperability with Discourse, pages 178–186.

- For **LDC2017T10**, the citation is:
  > Banarescu, L., Bonial, C., Cai, S., Georgescu, M., Grifﬁtt, K., Hermjakob, U., Knight, K., Koehn, P., Palmer, M., & Schneider, N. (2013). Abstract meaning representation for sembanking. In Proceedings of the 7th Linguistic Annotation Workshop & Interoperability with Discourse, pages 178–186.

Since both datasets are part of the same project, they share the same citation.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are captured accurately.
