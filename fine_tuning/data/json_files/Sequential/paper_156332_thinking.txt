To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Get the Gist? Using Large Language Models for Few-Shot Decontextualization" by Benjamin Kane and Lenhart Schubert, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a few-shot method and preliminary results, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the evaluation of the proposed method.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Decontext Dataset**: This dataset is created by Choi et al. (2021) and is oriented towards text summarization. It consists of sentences from the Wikipedia corpus embedded within context paragraphs, each annotated with decontextualized sentences by up to 5 annotators.

2. **Switchboard Corpus**: This is a subset of the validation split from the Switchboard corpus (Godfrey et al., 1992), used to evaluate the performance of the method in a conversational context.

I will then verify the details of these datasets by checking the **References section** for full citations:

- For the **Decontext Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Eunsol Choi, Jennimaria Palomaki, Matthew Lamm, Tom Kwiatkowski, Dipanjan Das, and Michael Collins. *Decontextualization: Making sentences stand-alone*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 9:447–461, 2021.

- For the **Switchboard Corpus**, the citation is:
  > J. Godfrey, E. Holliman, and J. McDaniel. *Switchboard: telephone speech corpus for research and development*. In IEEE International Conference on Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP-92, volume 1, pages 517–520, 1992.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
