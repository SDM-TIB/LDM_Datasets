To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluation of contextual embeddings on less-resourced languages" by Matej Ulƒçar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted an empirical comparison using **14 tasks in nine languages**, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and evaluation metrics)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for various tasks. This section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their names, languages, and specific characteristics.

In **subsection 4.1.1 (Named entity recognition)**, the authors mention several datasets used for NER tasks across different languages. I will note the following datasets:

1. **hr500k**: A dataset for Croatian with 24,794 sentences and 28,902 tags.
2. **CoNLL-2003 NER**: An English dataset with 20,744 sentences and 43,979 tags.
3. **Estonian NER corpus**: Contains 14,287 sentences and 20,965 tags.
4. **FiNER data**: A Finnish dataset with 14,484 sentences and 16,833 tags.
5. **LV Tagger train data**: A Latvian dataset with 9,903 sentences and 11,599 tags.
6. **TildeNER**: A Lithuanian dataset with 5,500 sentences and 7,000 tags.
7. **factRuEval-2016**: A Russian dataset with 4,907 sentences and 9,666 tags.
8. **ssj500k**: A Slovene dataset with 9,489 sentences and 9,440 tags.
9. **Swedish NER**: A Swedish dataset with 9,369 sentences and 7,292 tags.

Next, I will check **section 4.1.2 (POS-tagging and Dependency parsing)** for additional datasets. The authors mention using datasets from the Universal Dependencies 2.3 and 2.8 for various languages, including Croatian, English, Estonian, Finnish, Latvian, Lithuanian, Russian, Slovene, and Swedish. I will note the specific datasets mentioned here as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

For example, I will look for citations related to the **CoNLL-2003 NER** dataset, which is widely recognized in the NLP community, and ensure I include it in my dataset extraction.

Finally, I will compile all the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its relevant details and citations.

By following this structured approach, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all relevant datasets from the research paper.
