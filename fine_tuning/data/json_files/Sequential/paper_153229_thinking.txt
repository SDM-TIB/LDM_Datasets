To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Shallow Syntax in Deep Water" by Swabha Swayamdipta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used. In the introduction, the authors often discuss the context and significance of their work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that detail the tasks and datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention several downstream tasks, and I will look for any datasets associated with these tasks.

In the **experiments section**, I find that the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for various tasks:

1. **CoNLL 2003 NER Dataset**: This dataset is used for named entity recognition tasks and is referenced as providing named entity annotations on newswire data. 

2. **OntoNotes 5.0**: This dataset is used for fine-grained named entity recognition and includes various entity types.

3. **Penn Treebank**: This dataset is utilized for phrase-structure parsing and is a well-known corpus in NLP.

4. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank**: This dataset is used for sentiment classification tasks and contains sentiment labels for sentences.

I will now check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For the **CoNLL 2003 NER Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Erik F Tjong Kim Sang and Fien De Meulder. *Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 shared task: Language-independent named entity recognition*. In Proceedings of the NAACL, 2003.

- For **OntoNotes 5.0**, the citation is:
  > Ralph Weischedel, Martha Palmer, Mitchell Marcus, Eduard Hovy, Sameer Pradhan, Lance Ramshaw, Nianwen Xue, Ann Taylor, Jeff Kaufman, Michelle Franchini, et al. *OntoNotes release 5.0*. Linguistic Data Consortium, 2013.

- For the **Penn Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Mitchell P Marcus, Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz, and Beatrice Santorini. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 1993.

- For the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D Manning, Andrew Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of EMNLP, 2013.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
