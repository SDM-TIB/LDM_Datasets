To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stereotype and Skew: Quantifying Gender Bias in Pre-trained and Fine-tuned Language Models" by Daniel de Vassimon Manela et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses metrics for quantifying gender bias and mentions the WinoBias pronoun resolution task, which suggests that this dataset is relevant.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or references to datasets. The introduction discusses the problem of gender bias in language models and references previous work, which may include datasets used in those studies.

I will then look specifically at the **related work** section, where the authors discuss prior research on gender bias and may mention datasets used in those studies. Here, I find that the authors reference the **WinoBias dataset**, which is explicitly mentioned as a benchmark for measuring bias in coreference pronoun resolution.

In the **method** section, the authors describe how they analyze bias using the WinoBias dataset. They mention that the dataset consists of two files, Test Set 1 (T1) and Test Set 2 (T2), which are used for different gender pronoun resolution tasks. This confirms the relevance of the WinoBias dataset for their experiments.

I will also check the **results and discussion** sections to see if any other datasets are mentioned or if there are any modifications to the WinoBias dataset that are relevant to their findings.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the WinoBias dataset. The authors cite the original paper that introduced the WinoBias dataset, which is crucial for providing proper attribution.

The full citation for the WinoBias dataset is:
> Jieyu Zhao, Tianlu Wang, Mark Yatskar, Ryan Cotterell, Vicente Ordonez, and Kai-Wei Chang. *Gender bias in coreference resolution: Evaluation and debiasing methods*. In Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 15â€“20, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details, including the name, description, and citation, into a structured format for further use or analysis.
