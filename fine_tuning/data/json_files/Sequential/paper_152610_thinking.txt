To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learn to Code-Switch: Data Augmentation Using Copy Mechanism on Language Modeling" by Genta Indra Winata et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of building large-scale datasets for training code-switching language models, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the need for large-scale corpora for code-switching, indicating that they may have used specific datasets for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and experiments sections**. In **section 4.1 (Corpus)**, the authors specifically mention using a conversational Mandarin-English code-switching speech corpus called **SEAME Phase II**. They describe how this data was collected from spontaneously spoken interviews and conversations in Singapore and Malaysia by bilingual speakers. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also check the **data statistics** provided in Table 1, which outlines the number of speakers, utterances, and tokens in the SEAME Phase II dataset. This reinforces the significance of this dataset in their research.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the SEAME Phase II dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

> Universiti Sains Malaysia Nanyang Technological University, “Mandarin-English code-switching in south-east Asia LDC2015S04. Web download. Philadelphia: Linguistic Data Consortium,” 2015.

This citation is crucial for proper attribution and should be included in the dataset entry.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry for SEAME Phase II, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
