To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sparse-View CT Reconstruction using Recurrent Stacked Back Projection" by Wenrui Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of simulated data for training and testing, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look closely at the **implementation** section, particularly the **Dataset Generation** subsection. Here, the authors mention using the **ALERT Task Order 4 dataset**, which consists of 188 full-view sinograms and high-quality 3D reconstructions of packed suitcases. This dataset is crucial for understanding the training and testing processes described in the paper.

I will also check the **experiments** section to see if any additional datasets are mentioned. The authors refer to using real sinogram data from the **ALERT Task Order 3 dataset** for testing their methods. This indicates that there are multiple datasets involved in their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. For the **ALERT Task Order 4 dataset**, the citation is:
   > C. Crawford, “Advances in automatic target recognition (ATR) for CT-based object detection system—final report,” in Task Order HSHQDC–12–J–00429. Dept. Homeland Security Center of Excellence, ALERT, Boston, MA, USA, 2014.

2. For the **ALERT Task Order 3 dataset**, the citation is:
   > C. Crawford, H. Martz, and W. C. Karl, “Research and development of reconstruction advances in CT-based object detection systems – final report,” in Tech. Rep. HSHQDC-12-J-00056. Dept. Homeland Security Center of Excellence, ALERT, Boston, MA, USA, 2013.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset names, descriptions, and their full citations. This will allow me to create structured entries for each dataset, ready for further processing or review.
