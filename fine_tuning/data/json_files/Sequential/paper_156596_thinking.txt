To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CBGT-Net: A Neuromimetic Architecture for Robust Classification of Streaming Data" by Shreya Sharma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the model is evaluated on two image classification tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section V (Evaluation)**, where the authors describe the environments used for evaluation. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of images of handwritten digits, with ten target categories corresponding to each digit (0-9). It contains a total of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each image being greyscale and 28x28 pixels in size.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 50,000 color images for training and 10,000 color images for testing, with each image being 32x32 pixels in size. The ten categories include airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

To confirm the details of these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. LeCun, C. Cortes, and C. Burges. *MNIST Handwritten Digit Database*. ATT Labs, 2010. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist.

- For the **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. Available: https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18268744.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
