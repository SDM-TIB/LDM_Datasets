To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inside the black box: Neural network-based real-time prediction of US recessions" by Seulki Chung, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of LSTM and GRU models for predicting US recessions, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction provides context about recession forecasting but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **data section** (Section 2), as this is where the author is likely to describe the datasets used in the research. In this section, the author mentions utilizing **194 real-time vintages of macroeconomic and financial market variables** covering the period from February 1967 to October 2021. This indicates that the dataset consists of various macroeconomic indicators, but I need to extract more specific details.

The author lists **25 predictors** in Table 1, which includes variables such as the S&P 500 index, unemployment rate, and term spread. Each variable is categorized and described, which is essential for understanding the dataset's composition. I will note down the key variables and their descriptions as they are part of the dataset.

Additionally, the author mentions that the data is primarily obtained from **Archival Federal Reserve Economic Data (ALFRED)**, which is crucial for citation purposes. I will ensure to include this source in the dataset citation.

In the **references section**, I will look for any specific papers or sources that describe the datasets or the variables used. The author cites several studies and papers related to the predictors, which may provide authoritative references for the dataset.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the following datasets:

1. **Real-time vintages of macroeconomic and financial market variables**: This dataset consists of 194 vintages covering various macroeconomic indicators from February 1967 to October 2021. The source is ALFRED.

2. **Predictors listed in Table 1**: I will summarize the key predictors and their descriptions, ensuring to capture their relevance to the recession forecasting task.

For the full citations, I will reference the ALFRED data source and any relevant studies mentioned in the paper that pertain to the predictors. 

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted datasets are clearly documented with their respective citations, ready for further processing or review.
