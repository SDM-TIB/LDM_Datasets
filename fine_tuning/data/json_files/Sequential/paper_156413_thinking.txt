To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explaining Deep Learning Models for Age-related Gait Classification Based on Time Series Acceleration" by Xiaoping Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves gait analysis using data collected from subjects performing a walking task, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, specifically the subsection titled "Subjects, Equipment, and Data Collection." Here, the authors mention that the dataset consists of **386 subjects**, which were derived by merging data from existing datasets. They also specify that **244 subjects** were ultimately included in the analysis, divided into two groups: adults and older adults. This indicates that the dataset is related to gait analysis and includes time-series acceleration data.

The authors reference **existing datasets** in this section, but they do not provide specific names or citations for these datasets. I will need to look further into the **references section** to find the original sources of the datasets mentioned. The references are numbered, and I will check each reference that corresponds to the datasets used in the study.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite several studies (references [19] to [23]) that likely contain the datasets they merged. I will extract the full citations for these references to ensure proper attribution.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. Each dataset will be described with its citation to ensure proper attribution in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
