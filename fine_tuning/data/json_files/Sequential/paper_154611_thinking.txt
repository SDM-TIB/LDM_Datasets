To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Guided Training: A Simple Method for Single-channel Speaker Separation" by Hao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated using the **WSJ0-2mix datasets**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset used for evaluation. Here, they describe the **WSJ0-2mix dataset** in detail, explaining that it consists of two-speaker mixtures generated from the WSJ0 corpus. They mention specifics about the training set, validation set, and test set, including the number of speakers and the conditions under which the mixtures were created.

The authors also provide information about the dataset's structure, such as the number of sentences and the Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) used, which further confirms the dataset's relevance and application in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **WSJ0-2mix dataset**. The paper cites the original source of the WSJ0 corpus, which is essential for providing a complete reference. The citation is as follows:

- For **WSJ0 corpus**, the citation is:
  > J. Garofolo, D. Graff, D. Paul, and D. Pallett. *CSR-I (WSJ0) Complete LDC93S6A*. Web Download. Philadelphia: Linguistic Data Consortium, 1993.

Since the WSJ0-2mix dataset is derived from the WSJ0 corpus, I will use this citation to represent the dataset in my final output.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and the full citation in a structured format for clarity and completeness. This will ensure that the dataset extraction is thorough and properly documented for future reference or analysis.
