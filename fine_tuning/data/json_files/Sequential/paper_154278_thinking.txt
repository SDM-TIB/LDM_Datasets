To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Federated Learning Approach to Anomaly Detection in Smart Buildings" by Raed Abdel Sater and A. Ben Hamza, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the study. The abstract mentions that the effectiveness of the proposed federated learning approach is demonstrated on three real-world datasets generated by the IoT production system at General Electric Current smart building. This indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to identify.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. The paper states that they used the following datasets:

1. **Sensors Event Log Dataset**: This dataset consists of sensor data collected from 180 devices categorized into five different groups (lights, HVAC thermostats, occupancy sensors, water leakage sensors, and access sensors). The authors mention that they selected 1 million event logs over a window time of 4 months, specifically during the summer season.

2. **Energy Usage Dataset**: This dataset includes energy data gathered from sensors measuring electricity consumption per device, with the unit measured in kW/h. The data is aggregated every 15 minutes and merged into the Event Log dataset based on the sensor ID.

3. **Weather API Dataset**: This dataset is used in conjunction with the Energy Usage dataset to enrich model learning. It includes basic weather parameters such as temperature, barometric pressure, humidity, precipitation, solar radiation, and wind speed collected from May to August 2019.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. However, since the datasets are generated from the IoT production system at General Electric, they may not have formal citations like published datasets. Instead, I will document them as they are described in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their descriptions and any relevant details, ensuring that I maintain the importance of full citations where applicable.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
