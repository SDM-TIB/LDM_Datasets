To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Complex Human Action Recognition in Live Videos Using Hybrid FR-DL Method" by Fatemeh Serpush and Mahdi Rezaei, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method using the **UCF dataset**, which is a widely-used dataset in action recognition research. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experimental results** sections. In the methodology section, the authors mention using the **UCF101 dataset** and **AlexNet** for benchmarking. The UCF101 dataset is described as a collection of large and complex video clips containing 101 action classes, over 13,000 video clips, and 27 hours of video data.

In the **experimental results** section, the authors confirm that they evaluated their proposed method on the **UCF101 dataset**, which reinforces its significance in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the UCF101 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> K. Soomro, A. R. Zamir, and M. Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212 0402, 2012.

Since the UCF101 dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about it.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry with the necessary details, ensuring that the full citation is included, as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference in future research.
