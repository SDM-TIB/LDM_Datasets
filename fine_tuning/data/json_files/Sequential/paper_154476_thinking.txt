To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BERT-GT: Cross-sentence n-ary relation extraction with BERT and Graph Transformer" by Po-Ting Lai and Zhiyong Lu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions improvements in accuracy on "n-ary and chemical-protein relation datasets," indicating that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the need for extracting genomic variant information and mention the **BioCreative CDR dataset** and a dataset proposed by **Peng et al. (2017)** for cross-sentence n-ary relation extraction. This suggests that these datasets are relevant to their work.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their method on two datasets:
1. **Peng et al. (2017) n-ary dataset**: This dataset is used for the cross-sentence n-ary relation extraction task, which includes 6,987 drug-gene-mutation relation instances and 6,087 drug-mutation relation instances.
2. **BioCreative CDR dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,500 PubMed abstracts annotated with chemical-disease relations, including 3,116 positive pairs and 13,477 negative pairs.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The relevant citations are:

- For the **n-ary dataset**:
  > Peng, N., et al. "Cross-sentence n-ary relation extraction with graph LSTMs." In Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, MIT Press, 2017, pp. 101-115.

- For the **BioCreative CDR dataset**:
  > Li, J., et al. "BioCreative V CDR task corpus: a resource for chemical disease relation extraction." Database, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will include details such as the number of instances, types of relations, and any specific characteristics mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that the full citations are included for each dataset as required.
