To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BASS: Boosting Abstractive Summarization with Unified Semantic Graph" by Wenhao Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on two datasets: **BIGPATENT** and **WikiSUM**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for understanding the experiments and results presented in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section (Section 5)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention:

1. **BIGPATENT**: This dataset is described as a large-scale patent document summarization dataset with an average input length of 3572.8 words and an average reference length of 116.5 words. The authors follow the standard splits for training, validation, and testing as outlined by Sharma et al. (2019).

2. **WikiSUM**: This dataset is identified as a large-scale multi-document summarization dataset. The authors mention that they utilize preprocessed results from Liu and Lapata (2019a), which involve splitting source documents into multiple paragraphs and selecting the top 40 paragraphs based on their titles. The average length of each paragraph is 70.1 tokens, and the target summary length is 139.4 tokens.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **BIGPATENT**, the citation is:
  > Sharma, C., Li, C., & Wang, L. (2019). BIGPATENT: A large-scale dataset for abstractive and coherent summarization. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (pp. 1074–1084). Florence, Italy.

- For **WikiSUM**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Y., & Lapata, M. (2019a). Hierarchical transformers for multi-document summarization. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (pp. 5070–5081). Florence, Italy.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the datasets are clearly documented and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
