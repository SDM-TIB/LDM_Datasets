To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SpArSe: Sparse Architecture Search for CNNs on Resource-Constrained Microcontrollers" by Igor Fedorov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors demonstrate their method on "four popular IoT datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **results** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention using four datasets: **MNIST**, **CIFAR10**, **CUReT**, and **Chars4k**. I will note down the context in which these datasets are used, including their sizes and any specific configurations mentioned.

In the **results section**, the authors provide details about the datasets, including the number of training, validation, and test samples for each dataset. For example, they mention:
- **MNIST**: 55,000 training samples, 5,000 validation samples, and 10,000 test samples.
- **CIFAR10**: 45,000 training samples, 5,000 validation samples, and 10,000 test samples.
- **CUReT**: 3,704 training samples, 500 validation samples, and 1,408 test samples.
- **Chars4k**: 3,897 training samples, 500 validation samples, and 1,886 test samples.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and can typically be found in the references or footnotes. 

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations:
- **MNIST**: 
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, Patrick Haffner, et al. "Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition." Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.
  
- **CIFAR10**: 
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. "Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images." Technical report, 2009.
  
- **CUReT**: 
  > Manik Varma and Andrew Zisserman. "A statistical approach to texture classification from single images." International Journal of Computer Vision, 62(1-2):61–81, 2005.
  
- **Chars4k**: 
  > Teófilo Emídio de Campos, Bodla Rakesh Babu, and Manik Varma. "Character recognition in natural images." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 273–280, 2009.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the representation of each dataset's contribution to the research.
