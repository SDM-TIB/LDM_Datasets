To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Ensemble Model for Sentiment Analysis of Hindi-English Code-Mixed Data" by Madan Gopal Jhanwar and Arpita Das, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the sentiment analysis of code-mixed data, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. In **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, they mention a specific dataset:

1. **Dataset for Sentiment Analysis of Hi-En Code-Mixed Data**: This dataset was released by Joshi et al. (2016) and contains user comments from public Facebook pages of Salman Khan and Narendra Modi. It consists of 3,879 sentences, categorized into 15% negative, 50% neutral, and 35% positive classes. The authors also explain how they split the dataset into training, development, and test sets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The citation for the dataset is:

- For the dataset by Joshi et al. (2016):
  > Aditya Joshi, Ameya Prabhu, Manish Shrivastava, and Vasudeva Varma. *Towards sub-word level compositions for sentiment analysis of Hindi-English code mixed text*. In Proceedings of COLING 2016, the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers, pages 2482â€“2491, 2016.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their respective citations from the paper.
