To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequence-to-Sequence Learning as Beam-Search Optimization" by Sam Wiseman and Alexander M. Rush, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of their method to three different sequence-to-sequence tasks: word ordering, parsing, and machine translation. This indicates that there may be datasets associated with these tasks.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe the tasks they evaluated their method on. In **Section 5.3 (Tasks and Results)**, they mention specific datasets used for each task:

1. **Word Ordering**: The authors state they used the **PTB dataset** (Penn Treebank) for the word ordering task. This dataset is commonly used for evaluating syntactic capabilities in NLP tasks.

2. **Dependency Parsing**: They also mention using the **Penn Treebank dataset** for dependency parsing, which aligns with the previous task.

3. **Machine Translation**: For the machine translation task, the authors refer to a dataset from the **IWSLT 2014 machine translation evaluation campaign**, specifically using data from translated TED talks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Penn Treebank dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marcus, M. P., Santorini, B., & Marcinkiewicz, M. A. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313-330.

- For the **IWSLT 2014 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cettolo, M., Niehues, J., St√ºker, S., Bentivogli, L., & Federico, M. (2014). Report on the 11th IWSLT evaluation campaign. In *Proceedings of IWSLT 2014*.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Penn Treebank Dataset**: Used for both word ordering and dependency parsing tasks.
2. **IWSLT 2014 Dataset**: Used for the machine translation task.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
