To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast(er) Exact Decoding and Global Training for Transition-Based Dependency Parsing via a Minimal Feature Set" by Tianze Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions achieving the best unlabeled attachment score on the **Chinese Treebank** and the **English Penn Treebank**, indicating that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup, stating that they used the **Penn Treebank (PTB)** for English and the **Chinese Treebank (CTB)** for Chinese. This confirms that both datasets are integral to their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Penn Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Marcus, M., Santorini, B., & Marcinkiewicz, M. A. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313-330.

- For the **Chinese Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Xue, N., Chiou, F. D., & Palmer, M. (2002). Building a large-scale annotated Chinese corpus. In *Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Computational Linguistics*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
