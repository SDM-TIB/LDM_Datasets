To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Study on Stock Forecasting Using Deep Learning and Statistical Models" by Himanshu Gupta and Aditya Jaiswal, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors use a record of **S&P 500 index data** for training and testing their models, which suggests that this is a key dataset.

Next, I will look for more details in the **methodology section**. Here, the authors mention that they used **SPY 500 ETF data** obtained from Yahoo Finance, which includes information about date, open and close values, high and low prices, and the volume of stock data. This dataset is crucial for their analysis and model training.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors discuss the performance of various models using the same SPY 500 ETF data, confirming its significance in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the SPY 500 ETF data, but I can reference the source from which it was obtained, which is Yahoo Finance. Therefore, I will note the following citation:

- For **SPY 500 ETF data**, the citation is:
  > Yahoo Finance. *SPY 500 ETF Historical Data*. Retrieved from https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/history/

Since the dataset is derived from Yahoo Finance, I will ensure to include this citation in my final output.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that highlights the dataset name, description, and citation, ready for further processing or review.
