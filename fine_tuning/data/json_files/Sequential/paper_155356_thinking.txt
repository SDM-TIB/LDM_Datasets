To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bridging Pre-trained Language Models and Hand-crafted Features for Unsupervised POS Tagging" by Houquan Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on the **Penn Treebank** and **multilingual Universal Dependencies treebank v2.0**, indicating that these are the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on the **Wall Street Journal (WSJ)** data from the Penn Treebank, and they describe two settings: **WSJ-All** and **WSJ-Split**. They also mention the **multilingual Universal Dependencies treebank v2.0 (UD)**, which consists of 10 languages.

In the **experiments section**, they provide details about the datasets used:
1. **Penn Treebank (PTB)**: Specifically, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) data, which is a well-known dataset for POS tagging.
2. **Multilingual Universal Dependencies treebank v2.0 (UD)**: This dataset includes multiple languages and is used for evaluating the model's performance across different linguistic contexts.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Penn Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Marcus, M. P., Santorini, B., & Marcinkiewicz, M. A. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313-330.

- For the **Universal Dependencies treebank**, the citation is:
  > McDonald, R., Nivre, J., Quirmbach-Brundage, Y., Goldberg, Y., Das, D., Ganchev, K., Hall, K., Petrov, S., Zhang, H., Täckström, O., Bedini, C., Bertomeu Castelló, N., & Lee, J. (2013). Universal Dependency annotation for multilingual parsing. In *Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)*, pages 92-97.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its corresponding citation.
