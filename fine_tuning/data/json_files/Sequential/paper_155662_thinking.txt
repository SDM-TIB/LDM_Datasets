To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Image Classification using Sequence of Pixels" by Gajraj Kuldeep, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the author discusses comparing sequential image classification methods and mentions using the **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10** datasets for experiments. This indicates that these datasets are central to the research.

Next, I will look into **section IV (Performance Evaluation)**, where the author explicitly mentions the datasets used for the experiments. The author provides details about both datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The paper states that the MNIST dataset contains images of digits from 0 to 9, with 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each of size 28x28 pixels.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The CIFAR-10 dataset is described as containing 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images across 10 classes, with each image being 32x32 pixels in size.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. "Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition." *Proceedings of the IEEE*, vol. 86, no. 11, pp. 2278–2324, 1998.

- For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. "Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images." Tech Report, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research along with their proper citations.
