To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reaching Human-Level Performance in Automatic Grammatical Error Correction: An Empirical Study" by Tao Ge, Furu Wei, and Ming Zhou, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention achieving state-of-the-art performance on the **CoNLL-2014** and **JFLEG** datasets, indicating that these are key datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. They mention several datasets for training and evaluation:

1. **Lang-8 Corpus**: This dataset consists of 1,114,139 error-corrected sentence pairs, which is a significant source of training data for their grammatical error correction model.

2. **Cambridge Learner Corpus (CLC)**: This dataset contains 1,366,075 error-corrected sentence pairs, also used for training.

3. **NUCLE (NUS Corpus of Learner English)**: This dataset has 57,119 error-corrected sentence pairs and is another source for training.

4. **Extended Lang-8**: This dataset includes 2,865,639 non-public error-corrected sentence pairs collected from Lang-8.com, contributing to the training data.

5. **CoNLL-2014**: This dataset is used for evaluation and contains 1,312 sentences.

6. **JFLEG**: This test set has 747 sentences and is also used for evaluation.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **Lang-8 Corpus**, the citation is:

- For the **CoNLL-2014**, the citation is:

  > Napoles, C., Sakaguchi, K., Post, M., & Tetreault, J. (2017). *JFLEG: A Fluency Corpus and Benchmark for Grammatical Error Correction*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
