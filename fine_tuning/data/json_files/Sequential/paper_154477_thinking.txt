To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluation of Deep Learning Models for Hostility Detection in Hindi Text" by Ramchandra Joshi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their approaches on the **Constraint@AAAI 2021 Hindi hostility detection dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look into the **Dataset Details section (III)**, where the authors provide a comprehensive description of the dataset. They mention that the dataset consists of **8192 online posts** collected from various social media platforms, tagged as hostile or non-hostile, and further classified into categories such as fake, hate, defamation, and offensive. This section provides essential details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

The authors also reference the dataset in the context of their methodology and results, confirming its significance in their experiments. I will note the specific statistics provided, such as the distribution of posts across different categories and the predefined splits for training, validation, and testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The relevant citation for the **Constraint@AAAI 2021 Hindi hostility detection dataset** is:

- M. Bhardwaj, M. S. Akhtar, A. Ekbal, A. Das, and T. Chakraborty. "Hostility detection dataset in Hindi." arXiv preprint arXiv:2011.03588, 2020.

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the dataset details as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Constraint@AAAI 2021 Hindi hostility detection dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset consisting of 8192 online posts collected from social media platforms, tagged as hostile or non-hostile, with hostile posts further classified into fake, hate, defamation, and offensive categories.
   - **Citation**: M. Bhardwaj, M. S. Akhtar, A. Ekbal, A. Das, and T. Chakraborty. "Hostility detection dataset in Hindi." arXiv preprint arXiv:2011.03588, 2020.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the dataset citation is clearly included for reference.
