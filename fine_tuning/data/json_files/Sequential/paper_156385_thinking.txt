To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Calibrated Seq2seq Models for Efficient and Generalizable Ultra-fine Entity Typing" by Yanlin Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted extensive experiments on the **UFET dataset**, which is a clear indication that this dataset is significant to their work.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or mentions of datasets. The introduction references the **UFET dataset** and discusses its importance in the context of ultra-fine entity typing, confirming its relevance.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, the authors explicitly mention the **UFET dataset** and provide a brief overview of its characteristics, including that it contains 10,331 entity types and is curated from various sources like GigaWord and OntoNotes.

Additionally, in the same section, the authors describe five specialized domain entity typing datasets derived from existing NER datasets, which include:

1. **WNUT2017**: A dataset containing user-generated text from social media platforms.
2. **JNLPBA**: A biomedical dataset focused on named entity recognition.
3. **BC5CDR**: Another biomedical dataset that deals with chemical-disease relations.
4. **MIT-restaurant**: A dataset containing customer reviews related to restaurants.
5. **MIT-movie**: A dataset containing customer reviews related to movies.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a table summarizing the statistics and examples from each dataset, which will help in understanding their structure and purpose.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations I need to retrieve are:

- For the **MIT-restaurant and MIT-movie datasets**:
  > The datasets are derived from customer reviews and do not have specific citations in the paper, but they are commonly referenced in the context of entity typing tasks.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
