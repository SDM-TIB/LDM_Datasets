To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint User and Data Detection in Grant-Free NOMA with Attention-based BiLSTM Network" by Saud Khan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets.

In this paper, the authors mention that they generated a training dataset artificially, which is crucial information. I will note the parameters used for generating this dataset, as they provide context for the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to datasets that may have been used in previous works or as benchmarks. This is important for providing full citations for any datasets referenced in the paper.

From my reading, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **Training Dataset**: The authors generated a dataset based on the parameters outlined in Table IV of the paper. This dataset is crucial for training the BiLSTM network and is created under specific conditions (e.g., number of devices, subcarriers, SNR distribution).

2. **Benchmark Datasets**: If the authors reference any established datasets for comparison in their experiments, I will document those as well.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets. Since the training dataset is generated by the authors, I will describe it based on the parameters provided in the paper. For any benchmark datasets mentioned, I will ensure to include their full citations as well.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its citation, making it easy for others to reference or utilize the datasets in future research.
