To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sensor-Based Continuous Hand Gesture Recognition by Long Short-Term Memory" by Tsung-Ming Tai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper presents a novel algorithm for hand gesture recognition, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the evaluation of this algorithm.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors describe the datasets used for training and testing their algorithm. Here, they mention that the training dataset contains **2900 sequences** produced by five participants, and the testing dataset consists of **3100 hand gestures** produced by seven participants. This is a clear indication that there are specific datasets being utilized.

I will also look for any references to existing datasets or any specific naming of datasets in the **methodology or results sections**. The authors do not explicitly name a standard dataset but describe the data collection process in detail, indicating that the data was collected using smartphones equipped with accelerometers and gyroscopes.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** for any papers that might describe the datasets or methodologies used. The authors reference several works related to gesture recognition, but they do not provide a specific citation for a dataset. Instead, they describe their own data collection process.

Since the datasets are generated from their own experiments, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Training Dataset**: Contains 2900 sequences of hand gestures collected from five participants, including variations in gesturing.
   - Citation: Tsung-Ming Tai, Yun-Jie Jhang, Zhen-Wei Liao, Kai-Chung Teng, and Wen-Jyi Hwang. *Sensor-Based Continuous Hand Gesture Recognition by Long Short-Term Memory*. IEEE Sensors Journal, vol. 2, no. 3, pp. 6000704, September 2018.

2. **Testing Dataset**: Comprises 3100 hand gestures produced by seven participants, with sequences containing multiple gestures.
   - Citation: Tsung-Ming Tai, Yun-Jie Jhang, Zhen-Wei Liao, Kai-Chung Teng, and Wen-Jyi Hwang. *Sensor-Based Continuous Hand Gesture Recognition by Long Short-Term Memory*. IEEE Sensors Journal, vol. 2, no. 3, pp. 6000704, September 2018.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the key details and citations for each dataset, ensuring that the information is clear and ready for further processing or review.
