To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Speech Representations and Phoneme Classification for Preserving the Endangered Language of Ladin" by Zane Durante et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a "novel dataset of the Fascian dialect of Ladin," which indicates that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsection titled **3.1 (Ladin dataset collection from native speakers)**. Here, the authors describe the dataset in detail, noting that it consists of audio recordings from native Ladin speakers in the Fassa Valley of northern Italy. They specify that the dataset includes 76 audio files totaling 5 hours and 38 minutes of conversations, which were transcribed into phoneme segments.

In this section, I will extract the following key details about the dataset:
- **Dataset Name**: Ladin Dataset
- **Description**: The dataset comprises audio recordings of conversations with four native speakers of the Ladin language, including phoneme transcriptions.
- **Size**: 76 audio files, totaling 5 hours and 38 minutes of recordings, with 2520 labeled phoneme segments across two interviews.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors refer to the original source of the linguistic data, which is crucial for proper citation. The relevant citation is:

> Yang, Y., Walker, R., Vietti, A., et al. (2021). "Ladin, varieties of val di fassa." *Journal of the International Phonetic Association*, pp. 1â€“26.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is complete and ready for any further processing or documentation needs.
