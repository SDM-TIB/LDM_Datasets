To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Complementarity-constrained predictive control for efficient gas-balanced hybrid power systems" by Kiet Tuan Hoang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the efficiency of gas turbines in hybrid power systems but does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction may provide more context or references to specific datasets used in the study.

Next, I will examine the **methods** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for validation or testing. In this paper, the authors describe their simulation environment and the parameters used, but I need to look for any specific datasets that were utilized in their experiments.

I will also check the **simulation and validation** section, where the authors might discuss the data used for simulations, including any real-world data or benchmarks that were referenced. If they mention any datasets, I will take note of their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed by others.

If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will look for any supplementary materials or appendices that might contain additional information about the data used in the study.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will involve formatting the information clearly and accurately to facilitate further use or analysis.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Examine the methods and experiments sections for detailed descriptions of datasets.
3. Check the simulation and validation section for any data references.
4. Consult the References section for full citations of identified datasets.
5. Compile the dataset information with proper citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
