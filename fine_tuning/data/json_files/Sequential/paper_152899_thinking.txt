To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Deep Learning Strategies For Automatic Speech Recognition" by Wei Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their methods on the **2000-hour Switchboard (SWB2000)** dataset, which is a key dataset for automatic speech recognition (ASR). This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will proceed to the **methodology section** (Section 4), where the authors describe the acoustic model and the datasets used. In Section 4.2, they specifically mention the **SWB2000** dataset as well as the **CallHome (CH)** dataset, which is also used for evaluation. This confirms that both datasets are relevant for my extraction.

Now, I will gather detailed descriptions of these datasets:
1. **SWB2000 Dataset**: This dataset is described as a widely used benchmark for ASR, consisting of 2000 hours of conversational telephone speech. It is crucial for evaluating the performance of ASR systems.
2. **CallHome Dataset**: This dataset is used for testing and consists of conversational telephone speech, specifically designed for the evaluation of ASR systems.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:
- For the **SWB2000 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > G. Saon, G. Kurata, T. Sercu, K. Audhkhasi, S. Thomas, D. Dimitriadis, X. Cui, B. Ramabhadran, M. Picheny, L.-L. Lim, B. Roomi, and P. Hall. "English conversational telephone speech recognition by humans and machines." In Interspeech, 2017.

- For the **CallHome Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. Amodei et al. "Deep Speech 2: End-to-end speech recognition in English and Mandarin." In ICML, 2016, pp. 173â€“182.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have a clear and organized representation of the datasets extracted from the paper.
