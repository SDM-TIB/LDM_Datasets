To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pagsusuri ng RNN-based Transfer Learning Technique sa Low-Resource Language" by Dan John Velasco, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the challenges of low-resource languages and mentions the development of a pre-trained AWD-LSTM language model, which suggests that datasets are involved in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the use of Transfer Learning (TL) techniques and references several applications in low-resource languages, including a specific mention of the **Hate Speech Dataset** (Cabasag et al., 2019). This indicates that this dataset is likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, where the author describes the training process. Here, the **Hate Speech Dataset** is explicitly mentioned again, confirming its use for benchmarking the AWD-LSTM model. Additionally, the author refers to **WikiText-TL-39** as the training data for the language model pre-training phase. This dataset is crucial for understanding the model's performance.

In the **results section**, the author discusses the performance of the AWD-LSTM on the Hate Speech classification task, further validating the importance of this dataset in the study.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **Hate Speech Dataset**, the citation is:
   > Neil Vicente Cabasag, Vicente Raphael Chan, Sean Christian Lim, Mark Edward Gonzales, and Charibeth Cheng. *Hate speech in Philippine election-related tweets: Automatic detection and classification using natural language processing*. Philippine Computing Journal, XIV No. 1 August 2019.

2. For **WikiText-TL-39**, the citation is:
   > Jan Christian Blaise Cruz and Charibeth Cheng. *Evaluating language model finetuning techniques for low-resource languages*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.00409.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **Hate Speech Dataset**: Used for benchmarking the AWD-LSTM model in the context of hate speech classification.
- **WikiText-TL-39**: Utilized for pre-training the AWD-LSTM language model, derived from Tagalog Wikipedia articles.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
