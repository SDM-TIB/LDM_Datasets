To extract datasets from the research paper titled "National-scale electricity peak load forecasting: Traditional, machine learning, or hybrid model?" by Juyong Lee and Youngsang Cho, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the importance of accurate peak load forecasting and mentions various models but does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors highlight the significance of forecasting electricity demand but do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **methodology section** where the authors describe the models used for forecasting.

In the **methodology section**, the authors state that they collected electricity peak load data from the Korea Power Exchange (KPX) and meteorological data from the National Climate Data Center. This indicates that these two sources are crucial datasets for their study.

Next, I will check the **results section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or any specific details about the data used. The authors mention using five years of daily data from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2018, for training and test data from January 1, 2019, to October 19, 2019. This provides a clear timeframe for the datasets.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Electricity Peak Load Data**: 
   - Source: Korea Power Exchange (KPX)
   - Citation: Korea Power Exchange. *EPSIS (Electric Power Statistics Information System)*. Available at: http://epsis.kpx.or.kr/ (accessed October 2, 2020).

2. **Meteorological Data**: 
   - Source: National Climate Data Center
   - Citation: National Climate Data Center. *KMA (Korea Meteorological Administration)*. Available at: https://data.kma.go.kr/cmmn/main.do (accessed October 2, 2020).

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations as they are critical for proper referencing in any subsequent work or analysis. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and can be easily accessed by others interested in this research.
