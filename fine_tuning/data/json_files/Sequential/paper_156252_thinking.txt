To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ALJP: An Arabic Legal Judgment Prediction in Personal Status Cases Using Machine Learning Models" by Salwa Abbara et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information accurately, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed an Arabic legal judgment prediction system, which suggests that a dataset was created or utilized for this purpose.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their study. Here, they mention the development of an Arabic LJP dataset specifically for Saudi Arabian personal status cases. They detail the sources of the dataset, including cases published by the Ministry of Justice and a simulated dataset generated by legal experts.

The authors provide specific information about the dataset:
1. **Ministry of Justice Dataset**: This dataset includes personal status cases with various attributes such as topic, evidence, case summary, and judgment. They specify that it contains 49 cases, focusing on custody and annulment of marriage.

2. **Simulated Dataset**: This dataset was created by law experts and includes additional cases for custody and annulment of marriage. The authors mention that this dataset consists of claims, answers, pleadings, judgments, and evidences.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are developed by the authors themselves and not published in separate papers, I will note that the citation for the Ministry of Justice dataset is not available in the traditional sense. Instead, I will provide a description of the dataset's origin.

The citation for the simulated dataset is also not available as it was generated by the authors. Therefore, I will summarize the information as follows:

- **Arabic LJP Dataset for Saudi Arabian Personal Status Cases**: This dataset was developed by collecting personal status cases published by the Ministry of Justice and generating a simulated dataset through collaboration with legal experts. It includes a total of 49 cases focusing on custody and annulment of marriage.

In summary, I will compile the dataset entries with the relevant details, ensuring that I clearly indicate the sources and the nature of the datasets, even if formal citations are not applicable in this case. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
