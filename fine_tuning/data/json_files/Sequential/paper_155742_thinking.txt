To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Developing State-of-the-Art TTS Synthesizers for 13 Indian Languages with Signal Processing Aided Alignments" by Anusha Prakash et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of TTS systems for 13 Indian languages, which suggests that there may be datasets associated with these languages.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training their TTS systems. In this section, they mention that they trained systems for 13 Indian languages using the **Indic TTS database**. They specify that each dataset consists of about 10 hours of data spoken by a single person for each language.

I will note the specific languages mentioned in the paper, which include Assamese, Bengali, Bodo, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Manipuri, Marathi, Odia, Rajasthani, Tamil, and Telugu. This indicates that there are multiple datasets corresponding to each of these languages.

To ensure I have the correct citations for the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The authors refer to the Indic TTS database in reference [34]. I will extract the full citation for this dataset:

- **Indic TTS Database**:
  > Arun Baby, Anju Leela Thomas, Nishanthi N L, and Hema A Murthy. "Resources for Indian languages." In Community-based Building of Language Resources (International Conference on Text, Speech and Dialogue), 2016, pp. 37â€“43.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Indic TTS Database**: This dataset includes TTS data for 13 Indian languages, with each language dataset consisting of approximately 10 hours of audio data spoken by a single person.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included as required.
