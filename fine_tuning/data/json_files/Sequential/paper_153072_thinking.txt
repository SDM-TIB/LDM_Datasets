To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A new approach to forecast service parts demand by integrating user preferences into multi-objective optimization" by Wenli Ouyang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method using service parts consumption data from Lenovo Group Ltd, which indicates that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Implementation Details)**, where the author provides more specific information about the datasets used. The paper mentions that the evaluation is based on service parts consumption data collected over five years across three regions: Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Asia Pacific and Japan (AP), and North America (NA). This suggests that the dataset is extensive and covers multiple geographical areas.

In this section, the author also mentions that the data includes not only service parts consumption data but also other internal data (like installed base and service parts category) and external data (such as weather conditions and holidays). However, the primary dataset for evaluation appears to be the service parts consumption data.

I will now look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the service parts consumption data, as it is proprietary data from Lenovo Group Ltd. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is not publicly available and does not have a formal citation.

Based on this analysis, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Service Parts Consumption Data**: This dataset includes service parts consumption data collected over five years from Lenovo Group Ltd across three regions (EMEA, AP, NA). It consists of various features related to service parts demand forecasting.

Since there is no formal citation for this dataset, I will indicate that it is proprietary data from Lenovo Group Ltd.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
