To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Tree Architecture of LSTM Networks for Sequential Regression with Missing Data" by S. Onur Sahin and Suleyman S. Kozat, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed method on "well-known financial and real-life datasets," which indicates that specific datasets may be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using various datasets for their experiments, particularly in the **Experiments section**. I will focus on identifying the specific datasets used for evaluation.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors explicitly mention the following datasets:

1. **New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Dataset**: This dataset contains stock prices of 36 different companies over 5651 days. The authors specifically mention using the stock prices of Amer-Brands for their simulations.

2. **Bitcoin Dataset**: This dataset includes the price of Bitcoin in terms of USD. The authors note that this dataset is more challenging and unstable compared to the NYSE dataset.

3. **Kinematics Dataset**: This dataset simulates an 8-link all-revolute robotic arm, where the aim is to predict the distance of the effector from the target.

4. **California Housing Dataset**: This dataset contains house prices in the California area, and the goal is to estimate the median of these house prices.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the references section of the paper:

- For the **New York Stock Exchange Dataset**, the citation is:
  > "New York Stock Exchange Dataset," http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/∼rani/portfolios/NYSE Dataset.htm, accessed: 2018-03-8.

- For the **Bitcoin Dataset**, the citation is:
  > "Public REST API for Binance," https://github.com/binance-exchange/binance-official-api-docs/blob/master/rest-api.md, accessed: 2018-03-15.

- For the **Kinematics Dataset**, the citation is:
  > L. Torgo, "Regression Data Sets." [Online]. Available: http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/∼ltorgo/Regression/DataSets.html.

- For the **California Housing Dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. E. Rasmussen et al., "Delve Data Sets." [Online]. Available: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/∼delve/data/datasets.html.

With these citations, I can now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately identified and documented the datasets used in the research paper.
