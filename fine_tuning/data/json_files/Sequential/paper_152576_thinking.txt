To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Language Identification with Deep Bottleneck Features" by Zhanyu Ma and Hong Yu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **AP17-OLR database** for evaluating the proposed speech language identification (SLD) model, which indicates that this is a key dataset.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe the **AP17-OLR database** in detail, including the number of languages, speakers, and utterances. They also mention that the database is divided into train/dev and test subsets, which is crucial for understanding how the dataset is structured.

In the **database subsection**, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the AP17-OLR database, including the languages involved (e.g., Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, etc.) and the total number of utterances for each language. This information is essential for accurately describing the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the AP17-OLR database. The citation is as follows:
> Z. Tang, D. Wang, Y. Chen, and Q. Chen. *AP17-OLR Challenge: Data, Plan, and Baseline*. In Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA ASC), pages 749â€“753, IEEE, 2017.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry for the AP17-OLR database, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
