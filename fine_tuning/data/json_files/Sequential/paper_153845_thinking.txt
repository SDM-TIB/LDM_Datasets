To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph-to-Tree Neural Networks for Learning Structured Input-Output Translation with Applications to Semantic Parsing and Math Word Problem" by Shucheng Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the Graph2Tree model in semantic parsing and math word problems, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they evaluate their model on two tasks: Semantic Parsing and Math Word Problems. 

For the **Semantic Parsing task**, the authors mention three benchmark datasets:
1. **JOBS Dataset**: A set of 640 queries from a job listing database.
2. **GEO Dataset**: A set of 880 queries on a database of U.S. geography.
3. **ATIS Dataset**: A dataset of 5410 queries from a flight booking system.

For the **Math Word Problems task**, the authors refer to two datasets:
1. **MAWPS Dataset**: Contains 2373 pairs of math word problems with single unknown variables.
2. **MATHQA Dataset**: A large-scale dataset with 37,000 English pairs, each corresponding to an annotated formula.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. 

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
