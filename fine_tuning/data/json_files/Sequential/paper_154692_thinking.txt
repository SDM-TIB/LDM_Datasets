To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Text Summarization of Czech News Articles Using Named Entities" by Petr Marek et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract mentions the **SumeCzech dataset**, which is a large Czech news-based summarization dataset created by Straka et al. (2018). This indicates that SumeCzech is a primary dataset used in the research.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the SumeCzech dataset. They explain that it contains over a million documents, including headlines, abstracts, and full texts, collected from various Czech news websites. The dataset is split into training, development, and test sets, along with an out-of-domain (OOD) test set.

In **section 3.1 (Named Entity Annotations)**, the authors mention using the **CoNLL-based extended CNEC 2.0 dataset** for training a named entity recognition model. This dataset is crucial for their named entity annotation process.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **SumeCzech dataset**, the citation is:
   > Straka, Milan, Nikita Mediankin, Tom Kocmi, Zdeněk Žabokrtský, Vojtěch Hudeček, and Jan Hajič. *SumeCzech: Large Czech news-based summarization dataset*. In Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2018), 2018.

2. For the **CoNLL-based extended CNEC 2.0 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Konkol, Michal, Miloslav Konopík, Magda Ševčíková, Zdeněk Žabokrtský, Jana Straková, and Milan Straka. *CoNLL-based Extended Czech Named Entity Corpus 2.0*. LINDAT/CLARIAH-CZ digital library at the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics (ÚFAL), Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research along with their proper citations.
