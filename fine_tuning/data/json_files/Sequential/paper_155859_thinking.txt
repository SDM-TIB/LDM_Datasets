To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detection of Malfunctioning Modules in Photovoltaic Power Plants using Unsupervised Feature Clustering Segmentation Algorithm" by Divyanshi Dwivedi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used an online available dataset for recognizing faults in solar panels, which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **Section II (Description of Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset they used. They refer to an online accessible dataset that comprises infrared thermal images of solar photovoltaic panels. The authors also provide a citation for this dataset, which is crucial for proper referencing.

In the **References section**, I will locate the full citation for the dataset mentioned in Section II. The authors cite the dataset as follows:

- **Dataset for recognition of snail trails and hot spot failures in monocrystalline Si solar panels**:
  > E. Alfaro-Mejía, H. Loaiza-Correa, E. Franco-Mejía, A. D. Restrepo-Girón, and S. E. Nope-Rodríguez. *Dataset for recognition of snail trails and hot spot failures in monocrystalline Si solar panels*. Data in Brief, vol. 26, p. 104441, 2019.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details. The dataset consists of infrared thermal images used for detecting faults in solar photovoltaic panels, specifically focusing on identifying snail trails and hot spots.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
