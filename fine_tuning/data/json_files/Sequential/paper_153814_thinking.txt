To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MuBiNN: Multi-Level Binarized Recurrent Neural Network for EEG signal Classification" by Seyed Ahmad Mirsalari et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed method for EEG classification, which suggests that there may be a specific dataset used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention that they have binarized an LSTM-based classification algorithm for an EEG signal dataset, specifically stating that the dataset consists of **3625 samples with 32 features and 1300 time-steps**. However, the specific name of the dataset is not provided in this section.

To ensure I have all relevant information, I will also check the **references section** for any citations that might indicate the source of the EEG dataset used in their experiments. The references may include prior works that utilized similar datasets or provide context for the dataset used.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that there are no explicit mentions of a specific EEG dataset in the citations. However, I will note that the authors refer to their previous work in reference [12], which may provide additional context or details about the dataset.

Since the paper does not provide a specific dataset name, I will summarize the information I have gathered:

1. **EEG Signal Dataset**: The dataset consists of 3625 samples with 32 features and 1300 time-steps. The authors do not specify the name of the dataset in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the dataset, including the citation for the paper itself, which may be useful for future reference:

- For the EEG dataset, since no specific citation is provided, I will note:

In conclusion, I will document the dataset information and the citation for the paper, ensuring that I have captured all relevant details for future reference or processing.
