To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discovering the Compositional Structure of Vector Representations with Role Learning Networks" by Paul Soulos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (The SCAN task)**, as it appears to be a critical section where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention the **SCAN dataset**, which is a synthetic semantic parsing task designed to test compositional generalization and systematicity. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details regarding datasets, as they often contain supplementary information that may not be included in the main text.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the SCAN dataset. The authors reference the original paper that introduced the SCAN dataset, which is crucial for providing proper attribution.

The citation for the SCAN dataset is:
> Lake, B. M., & Baroni, M. (2018). Generalization without systematicity: On the compositional skills of sequence-to-sequence recurrent networks. In International Conference on Machine Learning.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation in a structured format.

In summary, the steps I will take are:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on section 5 for specific details about the SCAN dataset.
3. Check the references for the full citation of the SCAN dataset.
4. Compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and completeness.
