To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-Sentence N-ary Relation Extraction with Graph LSTMs" by Nanyun Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed framework in two important precision medicine settings, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the need for extracting knowledge from biomedical literature, hinting at the use of datasets related to biomedical articles.

In the **datasets section (5.1)**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **PubMed Central**: This dataset consists of approximately one million full-text biomedical articles, which serves as the primary source for extracting drug-gene-mutation interactions.

2. **Gene Drug Knowledge Database (GDKD)**: This database contains curated knowledge about genomic biomarkers for cancer drugs and their clinical targetability.

3. **Clinical Interpretations of Variants In Cancer (CIVIC)**: This knowledge base provides information on the clinical significance of genetic variants in cancer.

The authors also mention that they used these databases for distant supervision, which is crucial for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **PubMed Central**, the citation is:
  > National Center for Biotechnology Information. *PubMed Central*. Available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/

- For **Gene Drug Knowledge Database (GDKD)**, the citation is:
  > Rodrigo Dienstmann, In Sock Jang, Brian Bot, Stephen Friend, and Justin Guinney. *Database of genomic biomarkers for cancer drugs and clinical targetability in solid tumors*. Cancer Discovery, 5, 2015.

- For **Clinical Interpretations of Variants In Cancer (CIVIC)**, the citation is:
  > CIVIC. *Clinical Interpretations of Variants In Cancer*. Available at: http://civic.genome.wustl.edu

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or processing.
