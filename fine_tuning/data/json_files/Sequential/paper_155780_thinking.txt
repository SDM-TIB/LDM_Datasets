To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Copy Mechanism for Handling Knowledge Base Elements in SPARQL Neural Machine Translation" by Rose Hirigoyen, Amal Zouaq, and Samuel Reyd, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their approach on "state-of-the-art datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Methodology)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used in their work. Here, they mention several datasets:

1. **Monument Dataset**: This dataset consists of pairs of English natural questions and intermediary SPARQL queries generated from 38 templates. The authors reference the work by Soru et al. (2017) for this dataset.

2. **LC-QuAD Dataset**: The authors prioritize LC-QuAD v1.0 (Trivedi et al., 2017) over the newer version, stating that it contains 5000 entries generated from 33 templates. This dataset is noted for its complexity compared to the Monument dataset.

3. **TNTSPA Dataset**: This dataset is derived from LC-QuAD v1.0 but is split differently. It contains reformulated questions and queries, and the authors use it to reproduce state-of-the-art results.

4. **DBNQA Dataset**: The DBpedia Neural Question Answering dataset (Hartmann et al., 2018) consists of 894,499 pairs of natural language questions and SPARQL queries, generated using 5165 templates.

In the **References section**, I will find the full citations for each dataset:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
