To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DepGraph: Towards Any Structural Pruning" by Gongfan Fang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments. The introduction often discusses the motivation behind the research and may reference datasets used in prior work or the current study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on various datasets, including CIFAR, ImageNet, PPI, ModelNet, and AGNews. I will note down these datasets as they are crucial for understanding the scope of the research.

I will then look for any specific **subsections** within the experiments section that detail the datasets. For instance, the authors might describe the characteristics of each dataset, such as the number of samples, types of tasks (e.g., image classification, text classification), and any relevant splits (train/test).

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

Here are the datasets I will extract along with their citations:

1. **CIFAR**: 
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

2. **ImageNet**: 
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

3. **PPI**: 
   > Will Hamilton, Zhitao Ying, and Jure Leskovec. *Inductive representation learning on large graphs*. Advances in neural information processing systems, 30, 2017.

4. **ModelNet**: 
   > Zhirong Wu, Shuran Song, Aditya Khosla, Fisher Yu, Linguang Zhang, Xiaoou Tang, and Jianxiong Xiao. *3D ShapeNets: A deep representation for volumetric shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 1912–1920, 2015.

5. **AGNews**: 
   > Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, and Yann LeCun. *Character-level convolutional networks for text classification*. Advances in neural information processing systems, 28, 2015.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their sources from the paper.
