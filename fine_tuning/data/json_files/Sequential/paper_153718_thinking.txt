To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accelerator-Aware Neural Network Design Using AutoML" by Suyog Gupta and Berkin Akin, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction discusses the context of on-device machine learning and the need for efficient neural network architectures, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** section, particularly focusing on any subsections that might detail the datasets used for training or evaluation. In this paper, the authors describe their approach to neural architecture search (NAS) and performance modeling, but they do not specify any datasets in this section either.

I will then look into the **results** section, where the authors present their findings related to the Edge TPU models. Here, they mention that they have developed models like **EfficientNet-EdgeTPU** and **MobileNetEdgeTPU**, but they do not provide specific datasets used for training these models.

Finally, I will check the **references** section for any citations that might refer to datasets indirectly through the works cited. However, the references primarily consist of papers discussing neural network architectures and performance metrics rather than specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors did not explicitly mention any datasets used in their experiments. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

In summary, I will document my findings as follows:
- No datasets were explicitly mentioned in the paper "Accelerator-Aware Neural Network Design Using AutoML" by Suyog Gupta and Berkin Akin.

This process highlights the importance of carefully reading through all sections of a research paper to identify any datasets, even if they are not immediately obvious. In this case, the absence of datasets means I will not be able to provide any citations or further details.
