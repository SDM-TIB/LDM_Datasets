To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Utterance-Level Sequential Modeling for Deep Gaussian Process Based Speech Synthesis Using Simple Recurrent Unit" by Tomoki Koriyama and Hiroshi Saruwatari, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluations sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Evaluations)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention using the **JSUT corpus** for their evaluations, which is a significant dataset for speech synthesis tasks.

I will then look for a detailed description of the dataset, including its size, structure, and any specific subsets used. The authors mention that they used a subset of the JSUT corpus, specifically from BASIC0001 to BASIC2000, and provide details about the number of sentences used for training, development, and testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the JSUT corpus. The citation provided in the references is:
> R. Sonobe, S. Takamichi, and H. Saruwatari. *JSUT corpus: free large-scale Japanese speech corpus for end-to-end speech synthesis*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.00354, 2017.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset details into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the JSUT corpus as it is crucial for proper attribution.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the JSUT corpus, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and completeness.
