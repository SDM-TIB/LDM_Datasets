To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transfer Learning for Sequences via Learning to Collocate" by Wanyun Cui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of transfer learning for sequence tasks but does not specify any datasets. However, the introduction emphasizes the need for labeled data in specific domains, which suggests that datasets will be discussed later.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where datasets are typically detailed. In **section 4.2 (Sentence Classification: Sentiment Analysis)**, the authors mention using the **Amazon review dataset** for their experiments. They provide specific statistics about the dataset, including the number of reviews across different domains (books, DVD, electronics, kitchen) and the nature of the reviews (positive or negative). This section is crucial as it provides both the dataset name and its context.

In **section 4.3 (Sequence Labeling)**, the authors mention two datasets for their tasks: the **Penn Treebank (PTB)** for POS tagging and the **CoNLL 2003** dataset for named entity recognition (NER). They provide details about the training, development, and test tokens for each dataset, which is essential for understanding their usage in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Amazon Review Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > John Blitzer, Mark Dredze, and Fernando Pereira. *Biographies, Bollywood, Boom-boxes and Blenders: Domain Adaptation for Sentiment Classification*. In Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 440–447, 2007.

2. **Penn Treebank (PTB)**:
   - Citation:
     > Marcus, M. P., Santorini, B., & Marcinkiewicz, M. A. *Building a Large Annotated Corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. In Computational Linguistics, 19(2), 1993.

3. **CoNLL 2003 Dataset**:
   - Citation:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
