To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model Blending for Text Classification" by Ramit Pahwa, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the author explicitly lists the datasets used for evaluation. This section typically contains a summary table that describes each dataset, including details such as the number of training and testing samples, classes, and average words per sample.

In this paper, the author mentions four datasets:

1. **IMDB Dataset**: Used for sentiment classification, with 25,000 training samples and 25,000 testing samples.
2. **TREC-6 Dataset**: Used for question classification, with 5,452 training samples and 500 testing samples.
3. **AG's Corpus of News Articles**: Used for topic modeling, with 120,000 training samples and 7,600 testing samples.
4. **DBpedia Dataset**: Used for classification tasks, with 560,000 training samples and 70,000 testing samples.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **IMDB Dataset**:

In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (pp. 142–150). Association for Computational Linguistics.

- **AG's Corpus of News Articles**:

- **DBpedia Dataset**:
  > Lehmann, J., Iannone, L., et al. (2015). DBpedia - A Large-scale, Multilingual Knowledge Base Extracted from Wikipedia. In Semantic Web Journal.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
