To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Harnessing Large Language Models Over Transformer Models for Detecting Bengali Depressive Social Media Text: A Comprehensive Study" by Ahmadul Karim Chowdhury et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a dataset called the **Bengali Social Media Depressive Dataset (BSMDD)**, which is a strong lead.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their study. Here, they mention two primary datasets:

1. **Reddit Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from the Reddit community, specifically from the subreddits r/depression and r/SuicideWatch, containing a total of 20,000 submissions. This dataset is used for the depressive texts in their analysis.

2. **Sentiment140 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,600,000 tweets extracted using the Twitter API, from which approximately 11,000 samples were collected for the non-depressive component of their dataset.

In the **annotations and translations section**, the authors describe the process of translating and annotating the collected data, which further emphasizes the creation of the BSMDD.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Reddit Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Reddit. *Reddit dataset: r/depression and r/suicidewatch*. March 2023. URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xavrig/reddit-dataset-rdepression-and-rsuicidewatch. Accessed: 2023-12-18.

- For the **Sentiment140 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sentiment140. *Sentiment140 dataset with 1.6 million tweets*. March 2023. URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140. Accessed: 2023-12-18.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
