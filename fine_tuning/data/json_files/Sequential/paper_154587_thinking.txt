To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pretrained Transformers As Universal Computation Engines" by Kevin Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions evaluating a model on various sequence classification tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly **section 2.1 (Tasks)**, where the authors describe the tasks they evaluate their model on. Here, they mention several tasks, and I will look for any datasets associated with these tasks. The tasks listed include:

1. **Bit Memory**
2. **Bit XOR**
3. **ListOps**
4. **MNIST**
5. **CIFAR-10**
6. **CIFAR-10 LRA**
7. **Remote Homology Detection**

For each task, I will note the details provided about the datasets used. For instance, the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets are standard benchmarks in the field, and I will need to confirm their citations.

In **section 3 (Empirical Evaluations)**, the authors provide results for these tasks, which may further confirm the datasets used. I will cross-reference this section to ensure that the datasets mentioned in the methodology are indeed the ones used for evaluation.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper documentation. The citations I will look for include:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **Bit Memory**, **Bit XOR**, and **ListOps**, I will check if the authors provide specific references or if they are original tasks defined in the paper.

- For **Remote Homology Detection**, I will look for the datasets mentioned in the context of TAPE, which is referenced in the paper.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
