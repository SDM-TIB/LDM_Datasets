To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Meta-Learning of Neural Architectures for Few-Shot Learning" by Thomas Elsken et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of few-shot learning and mentions empirical results on standard few-shot classification benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using standard few-shot learning datasets, specifically **Omniglot** and **MiniImagenet**. I will note down these datasets and their characteristics as described in the paper.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used for evaluation:
1. **Omniglot**: This dataset is used for few-shot learning tasks, specifically in a 1-shot, 20-way setting. The paper mentions that it consists of handwritten characters from various alphabets.
2. **MiniImagenet**: This dataset is also used for few-shot learning tasks, particularly in a 5-shot, 5-way setting. It is a subset of the ImageNet dataset, containing images of various objects.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the experiments.

For **Omniglot**, the citation is:
> Lake, B. M., Salakhutdinov, R., & Tenenbaum, J. B. (2015). Human-level concept learning through probabilistic program induction. *Science*, 350(6266), 1332-1338.

For **MiniImagenet**, the citation is:
> Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T., Kavukcuoglu, K., & Wierstra, D. (2016). Matching networks for one shot learning. In *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems* (pp. 3630-3638).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations to ensure that all necessary details are included for future reference or processing.
