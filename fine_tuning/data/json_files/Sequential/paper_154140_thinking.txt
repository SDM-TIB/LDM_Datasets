To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Linguistically Inspired Morphological Inflection with a Sequence to Sequence Model" by Eleni Metheniti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions using an "inflectional corpus" created by Metheniti and Neumann (2020), which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Methodology)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Finding the inflectional information)**, where the authors discuss the creation of an inflectional corpus for 138 languages. They mention that this corpus is derived from the English Wiktionary and includes morpheme boundaries, which is crucial for their experiments. This section provides detailed information about the dataset's structure and purpose.

The authors also reference two specific corpora:
1. **Wikinflection Corpus**: This corpus is created from Wiktionary and includes segmented words and morpheme boundaries. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Metheniti, E., & Neumann, G. (2020). Wikinflection corpus: A (better) multilingual, morpheme-annotated inflectional corpus. In Proceedings of The 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pages 3905–3912.

2. **UniMorph Corpus**: This is another dataset mentioned, which is a project aimed at creating a large morphological corpus with feature-annotated inflectional paradigms. The citation for this dataset is:
   > McCarthy, A. D., Kirov, C., Grella, M., et al. (2020). Unimorph 3.0: Universal morphology. In Proceedings of The 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pages 3922–3931.

In **section 5 (Results)**, the authors discuss their experiments using the Wikinflection corpus and the results obtained from various languages, confirming the practical application of the datasets.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations:

1. **Wikinflection Corpus**:
   > Metheniti, E., & Neumann, G. (2020). Wikinflection corpus: A (better) multilingual, morpheme-annotated inflectional corpus. In Proceedings of The 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pages 3905–3912.

2. **UniMorph Corpus**:
   > McCarthy, A. D., Kirov, C., Grella, M., et al. (2020). Unimorph 3.0: Universal morphology. In Proceedings of The 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pages 3922–3931.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are formatted correctly for any required output or documentation.
