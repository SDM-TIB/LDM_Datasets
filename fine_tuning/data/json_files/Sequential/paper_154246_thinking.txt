To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Complementary Nature of Knowledge Graph Embedding, Fine Grain Entity Types, and Language Modeling" by Rajat Patel and Francis Ferraro, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental settings sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "publicly available data," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss various knowledge graphs and mention datasets like **Freebase** and **DBpedia**. This indicates that these datasets are relevant to their work.

In the **experimental settings section**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention:

1. **WN11**: A dataset derived from WordNet, which is a lexical graph of synsets.
2. **FB13**: A dataset from Freebase, which consists of factual tuples of entities related through semantic relations.
3. **FIGER**: A dataset for fine-grained entity typing, which includes sentences from Wikipedia articles and news reports.
4. **OntoNotes**: A manually curated dataset consisting of various entity types.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to confirm that these datasets were indeed used in the experiments and to gather any additional context about their application.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **WN11**, the citation is:
  > Carlo Strapparava and Alessandro Valitutti. *Wordnet Affect: An Affective Extension of Wordnet*. In LREC, 2004.

- For **FB13**, the citation is:
  > Kurt D. Bollacker, C. J. Evans, Praveen Paritosh, Tim Sturge, and Jamie Taylor. *Freebase: A Collaboratively Created Graph Database for Structuring Human Knowledge*. In SIGMOD Conference, 2008.

- For **FIGER**, the citation is:
  > Ling, X., & Weld, D. S. (2012). *Fine-grained Entity Recognition*. In AAAI.

- For **OntoNotes**, the citation is:
  > Hovy, E. H., Marcus, M. P., Palmer, M., Ramshaw, L. A., & Weischedel, R. M. (2006). *OntoNotes: The 90% Solution*. In HLT-NAACL.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
