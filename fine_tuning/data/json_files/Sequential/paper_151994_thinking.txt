To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning for Precipitation Nowcasting: A Benchmark and A New Model" by Xingjian Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a benchmark that includes a real-world large-scale dataset from the Hong Kong Observatory, which suggests that a specific dataset is being introduced.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Benchmark for Precipitation Nowcasting)**, where the authors describe the HKO-7 dataset in detail. Here, they provide comprehensive information about the dataset, including its purpose, the data it contains, and how it was collected. The HKO-7 dataset is explicitly mentioned as containing radar echo data from 2009 to 2015, which is crucial for my extraction.

In this section, the authors detail the characteristics of the HKO-7 dataset:
- It consists of radar CAPPI reflectivity images with a resolution of 480 × 480 pixels, covering a 512 km × 512 km area centered in Hong Kong.
- The data is recorded every 6 minutes, resulting in 240 frames per day.
- The dataset includes 812 days for training, 50 days for validation, and 131 days for testing.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the HKO-7 dataset is a new dataset introduced in this paper, it may not have a separate citation. Instead, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the paper is:
> Xingjian Shi, Zhihan Gao, Leonard Lausen, Hao Wang, Dit-Yan Yeung, Wai-kin Wong, and Wang-chun Woo. *Deep Learning for Precipitation Nowcasting: A Benchmark and A New Model*. In Proceedings of the 31st Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2017), Long Beach, CA, USA.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and the citation for the source of the dataset.

In summary, the key steps I followed are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the relevant sections detailing the datasets, particularly section 5.
3. Extract detailed information about the HKO-7 dataset.
4. Locate the citation for the dataset, which is the paper itself.

With this approach, I can ensure that I accurately capture the necessary details about the dataset for further processing or review.
