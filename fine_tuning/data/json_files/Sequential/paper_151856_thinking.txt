To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CliNER 2.0: Accessible and Accurate Clinical Concept Extraction" by Willie Boag et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the development of CliNER 2.0, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of clinical notes and mention the i2b2/VA 2010 challenge, which is a significant clue that a dataset is involved. I will note this down for further exploration.

Next, I will focus on the **data section** (section 3), where the authors explicitly state that they use data from the i2b2/VA 2010 challenge. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of sentences and summaries available for training and testing. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and usage in their experiments.

The dataset is described as follows:
- **i2b2/VA 2010 Challenge Dataset**: Contains 16,107 sentences from patient discharge summaries, with 169 summaries for training and 255 for testing.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the i2b2/VA 2010 challenge dataset. The relevant citation is:
> Uzuner, O., South, B. R., Shen, S., & DuVal, G. (2011). 2010 i2b2/va challenge on concepts, assertions, and relations in clinical text. *Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association*, 18, 552â€“556.

Having gathered this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. 

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete.
