To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Low Resource Text Classification with ULMFit and Backtranslation" by Sam Shleifer, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the author discusses augmenting the **IMDB movie reviews dataset** with synthetic examples generated through backtranslation. This indicates that the IMDB dataset is a primary dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the **IMDB dataset** in the **introduction** section. The author mentions that the IMDB dataset consists of **100,000 movie reviews**, with **25,000 labeled training examples** and **25,000 labeled test examples**. This confirms the dataset's structure and size.

I will then check the **experiments** section for any additional datasets or variations mentioned. The author refers to generating **431,000 backtranslations** using various languages, but this does not constitute a separate dataset; rather, it is a method of data augmentation applied to the IMDB dataset.

In the **related work** section, the author cites previous works that have used backtranslation and data augmentation techniques, but no new datasets are introduced here.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the IMDB dataset. The IMDB dataset is referenced in the context of its original paper:

- For the **IMDB dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 142â€“150, Portland, Oregon, USA, June 2011. Association for Computational Linguistics. URL http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P11-1015.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation for the IMDB dataset.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
