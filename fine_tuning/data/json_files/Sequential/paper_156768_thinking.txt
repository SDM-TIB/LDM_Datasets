To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CausalFormer: An Interpretable Transformer for Temporal Causal Discovery" by Lingbai Kong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on synthetic, simulated, and real datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for validation. Here, they mention:

1. **Synthetic Datasets**: These datasets are constructed with different causal structures, including diamond, mediator, v-structure, and fork. Each dataset has a specified number of time series and lengths.

2. **Lorenz 96 Dataset**: This dataset is generated using the Lorenz 96 model, which is a nonlinear model of climate dynamics. The authors provide a brief description of the model and its parameters.

3. **fMRI Dataset**: This dataset contains BOLD data for 28 different brain networks, with varying time spans and numbers of monitoring time series.

4. **Sea Surface Temperature (SST) Dataset**: This dataset is collected from the OI-SST data repository provided by NOAA, covering a specific geographical area and time span.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **Lorenz 96 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Edward N Lorenz. *Predictability: A problem partly solved*. In Proc. Seminar on predictability, volume 1. Reading, 1996.

- For the **fMRI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Stephen M Smith et al. *Network modelling methods for fMRI*. Neuroimage, 54(2):875â€“891, 2011.

- The **SST Dataset** is referenced as:
  > NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). *Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OI-SST) data repository*.

The synthetic datasets do not have specific citations as they are constructed for the purpose of the study, but I will note their descriptions.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and that full citations are included for those that have them. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
