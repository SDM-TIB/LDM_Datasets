To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding Pedestrian-Vehicle Interactions with Vehicle Mounted Vision: An LSTM Model and Empirical Analysis" by Daniela A. Ridel et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments based on a real-world dataset captured with vehicle-mounted cameras, which suggests that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the dataset used. They mention that the dataset contains realistic inner-city scenarios with data collected by a moving vehicle. The paper states that the pedestrians were manually annotated, and their trajectories were optimized from stereo imaging. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's content and its purpose.

In the **method section**, the authors elaborate on how they encoded pedestrian and ego-vehicle data, which reinforces the importance of the dataset in their analysis. They also mention that the dataset includes Ground Truth (GT) labels for pedestrian positions, head orientation, and occlusion information, which are essential for understanding the dataset's structure and application.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The paper cites the dataset as follows:

- For the dataset used in their experiments, the citation is:
  > E. Rehder, F. Wirth, M. Lauer, and C. Stiller. *Pedestrian prediction by planning using deep neural networks*. In Proceedings of the 2018 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pages 1â€“5, 2018.

This citation provides the necessary details to reference the dataset accurately.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset, including its name, description, and citation, into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured and properly attributed.
