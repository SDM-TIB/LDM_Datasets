To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tensor Programs I: Wide Feedforward or Recurrent Neural Networks of Any Architecture are Gaussian Processes" by Greg Yang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations. 

2. **Identify Sections Related to Datasets**: Next, I will look for sections that explicitly discuss datasets. In this paper, I will focus on sections that might be titled "Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology." These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research.

3. **Extract Dataset Information**: As I read through the relevant sections, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used.

4. **Check References for Full Citations**: After identifying the datasets, I will consult the references section of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

5. **Document Each Dataset**: For each dataset identified, I will document the following information:
   - **Name of the Dataset**: The official name as mentioned in the paper.
   - **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and contents.
   - **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

6. **Compile the Information**: Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly presented with its name, description, and citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a comprehensive overview that can be useful for further research or validation of the findings presented in the study.
