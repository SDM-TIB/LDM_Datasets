To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Graph-to-Sequence Model for AMR-to-Text Generation" by Linfeng Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the model is trained on a "standard dataset (LDC2015E86)," which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper. The introduction also references the AMR (Abstract Meaning Representation) framework, which is essential for understanding the context of the dataset.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) to gather more details about the dataset used. In Section 5.1, the authors explicitly state that they use the **LDC2015E86** dataset, which contains 16,833 instances for training, 1,368 for development, and 1,371 for testing. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's structure and its significance in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the LDC2015E86 dataset. The citation is typically formatted as follows:

- For the **LDC2015E86** dataset, the citation is:
  > Banarescu, L., Bonial, C., Cai, S., Georgescu, M., Grifﬁtt, K., Hermjakob, U., Knight, K., Koehn, P., Palmer, M., & Schneider, N. (2013). Abstract meaning representation for sembanking. In Proceedings of the 7th Linguistic Annotation Workshop and Interoperability with Discourse (pp. 178–186).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the LDC2015E86 dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
