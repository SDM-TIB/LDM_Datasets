To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bidirectional LSTM-CRF for Clinical Concept Extraction" by Raghavendra Chalapathy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the **2010 i2b2/VA Natural Language Processing Challenges for Clinical Records**, indicating that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they describe the **2010 i2b2/VA reference corpora**, which consists of concept-annotated reports for training and testing. The paper specifies that there are **394 concept-annotated reports for training** and **477 for testing**, along with **877 unannotated reports**. This section confirms that the dataset is indeed the one utilized for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The relevant citation for the **2010 i2b2/VA challenge** is:

> Uzuner, Ã–., South, B. R., Shen, S., & DuVall, S. L. (2011). 2010 i2b2/VA challenge on concepts, assertions, and relations in clinical text. *Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association*, 18(5), 552-556.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify the main dataset.
2. Review section 4.1 for detailed information about the dataset.
3. Locate the full citation in the References section.

With this information, I am ready to document the dataset entry accurately.
