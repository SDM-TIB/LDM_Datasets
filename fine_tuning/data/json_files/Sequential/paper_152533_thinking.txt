To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Automated Customer Support" by Momchil Hardalov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using the **Twitter Customer Support Dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset they used. They mention that the dataset is called **Customer Support on Twitter**, which is a large corpus of tweets and replies from customer support interactions. The section outlines the dataset's size (3 million tweets from 20 companies) and the specific focus on tweets related to Apple support.

In this section, the authors also describe how they filtered the dataset and divided it into training and testing parts, ultimately resulting in 49,626 dialog tuples. This detailed information confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use in their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Customer Support on Twitter** dataset. The paper mentions that this dataset is available on Kaggle, which is crucial for providing a proper citation.

The citation for the dataset is:
> ThoughtVector. *Customer Support on Twitter*. Kaggle. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/thoughtvector/customer-support-on-twitter.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and its citation clearly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately represented for future reference or processing.
