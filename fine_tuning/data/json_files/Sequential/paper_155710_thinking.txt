To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Self-Regularized Adversarial Views for Self-Supervised Vision Transformers" by Tao Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights that the proposed method, AutoView, achieves improvements on **ImageNet** and **OpenImages**, indicating that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, particularly **section 4.2 (Main Classification Results)**, where the authors explicitly mention evaluating their method on **ImageNet-1K** and **OpenImages**. This confirms that these datasets are central to their research.

In **section 4.1 (Implementation Details)**, the authors provide additional context about the datasets, specifically mentioning that **ImageNet** contains 1.2 million training images and 50,000 validation images across 1,000 classes, while **OpenImages** consists of 9.1 million images. This detailed description will help in documenting the datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
   > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L.-J. Li, K. Li, and L. Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In CVPR, 2009.

2. For **OpenImages**, the citation is:
   > A. Kuznetsova, H. Rom, N. Alldrin, J. Uijlings, I. Krasin, J. Pont-Tuset, S. Kamali, S. Popov, M. Malloci, A. Kolesnikov et al. *The Open Images Dataset V4*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 128(7):1956â€“1981, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
