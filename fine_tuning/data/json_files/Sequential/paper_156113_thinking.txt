To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interval Load Forecasting for Individual Households in the Presence of Electric Vehicle Charging" by Raiden Skala et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "historical household electricity consumption data" and "weather station data," indicating that these are likely the datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Interval Load Forecasting in Presence of EV Charging)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset Preparation)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they mention two types of datasets:

1. **Weather Station Data**: This dataset consists of multiple datasets from various weather stations in the geographical areas surrounding the EV households. It includes hourly timestamps and temperature recordings, which are crucial for load forecasting.

2. **Historical Household Electricity Consumption Data**: This dataset contains hourly data recorded by smart meters for individual households, which is essential for predicting electricity demand.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors specify that they used data from **London Hydro**, which is a local electrical distribution utility. This indicates that the household electricity consumption data is sourced from this utility.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but it does reference the source of the household data:

- For **London Hydro**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is acknowledged as the source of the data used in the study.

- For **weather station data**, the authors mention that it was obtained from **Environment and Climate Change Canada**, but again, a specific citation is not provided.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for the datasets, I will note the sources as follows:

- **Weather Station Data**: Environment and Climate Change Canada (no specific citation provided).
- **Historical Household Electricity Consumption Data**: London Hydro (no specific citation provided).

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the sources as accurately as possible, even if they are not formal citations. This will help in documenting the datasets used in the research effectively.
