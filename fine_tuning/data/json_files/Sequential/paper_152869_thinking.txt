To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Abstractive Text Summarization and Fake News Detection" by Soheil Esmaeilzadeh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not explicitly mention datasets. However, the introduction discusses the importance of text summarization and hints at the use of datasets for training models.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide an overview of the datasets used. Here, they mention the **CNN-Dailymail dataset**, which is crucial for their summarization models. The authors describe this dataset as a collection of news articles and interviews from CNN and Daily Mail, detailing its structure and how it was split into training, validation, and test sets.

In section 3.1, the authors provide specific details about the **CNN-Dailymail dataset**:
- It contains 287,200 training pairs, 13,360 validation pairs, and 11,400 test pairs.
- Each article has an average of 781 tokens, and each reference summary contains an average of 3.75 sentences and 56 tokens.

Additionally, in the **fake news detection** section, the authors mention using a dataset provided by George McIntire, which consists of 3,164 fake news articles and 3,171 real articles. This dataset is also important for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **CNN-Dailymail dataset**, the citation is:
   > Danqi Chen, Jason Bolton, and Christopher D. Manning. *A Thorough Examination of the CNN/Daily Mail Reading Comprehension Task*. Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics. ACL 2016. http://doi.org/10.18653/v1/P16-1223.

2. For the **fake news dataset**, the citation is:
   > George McIntire. *On Building a Fake News Classification Model*. Available at: https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/on-building-a-fake-news-classification-model.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
