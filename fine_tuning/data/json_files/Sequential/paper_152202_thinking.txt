To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gate-Variants of Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Neural Networks" by Rahul Dey and Fathi M. Salem, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their GRU variants on the **MNIST** and **IMDB** datasets, which suggests these are the primary datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** and **background sections** for any additional context or details about these datasets. The introduction confirms that the MNIST dataset is used for generating sequences from images of handwritten digits, while the IMDB dataset is used for sentiment classification based on movie reviews.

I will then look into the **results and discussion sections** to see how the datasets were utilized in the experiments. The authors provide specific details about the MNIST dataset, stating it consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of size 28x28. For the IMDB dataset, they mention it contains 25,000 training and 25,000 test reviews, with a maximum of 80 words per review.

After gathering this information, I will check the **references section** for full citations of the datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y., Cortes, C., & Burges, C. J. C. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 2010. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For the **IMDB dataset**, the citation is:
  > Maas, A. L., Daly, R. E., Pham, P. T., Huang, D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2011). *Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pp. 142â€“150.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
