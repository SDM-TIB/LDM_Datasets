To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lumen: A Machine Learning Framework to Expose Influence Cues in Texts" by Hanyu Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a new dataset of 3,059 texts, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial to their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset Curation & Coding Methodology)**, where the authors describe how they curated their dataset. They mention three groups of texts: Deceptive Texts, Hyperpartisan News, and Mainstream News. I will extract the details of each group, including the number of texts and their sources.

1. **Deceptive Texts Group**: This group consists of 1,082 pieces of text, including:
   - **Facebook IRA Ads**: 492 ads from the Russian Internet Research Agency, sourced from a publicly available dataset provided to the U.S. House of Representatives.
   - **Fake News**: 130 articles labeled as fake or real, collected from PoliticFact.com.
   - **Phishing Emails**: 460 emails collected from various public sources.

2. **Hyperpartisan News Group**: This group contains 1,003 articles, with 506 right-leaning and 497 left-leaning articles, sourced from a public dataset of 2.7 million news articles from 27 American publications.

3. **Mainstream News Group**: This group includes 974 articles from seven mainstream publications, selected from the same public dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Facebook IRA Ads**: 
  > "Social Media Advertisements," U.S. House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Available: https://intelligence.house.gov/social-media-content/social-media-advertisements.htm

- **Fake News Dataset**: 
  > Sadeghi, A., et al. "Fnid: Fake news inference dataset," 2020. Available: https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/fbzd-sw81

- **Phishing Emails**: 
  > Smiles, M. "Phishing scam reports archive," 2019. Available: [source not specified in the text, but multiple sources are mentioned].

- **Hyperpartisan News Dataset**: 
  > "All the News 2: News Articles Dataset," 2020. Available: https://components.one/datasets/all-the-news-2-news-articles-dataset/

- **Mainstream News Dataset**: 
  > "All the News 2: News Articles Dataset," 2020. Available: https://components.one/datasets/all-the-news-2-news-articles-dataset/

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
