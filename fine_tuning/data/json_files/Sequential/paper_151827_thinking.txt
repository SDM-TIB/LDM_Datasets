To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Am I done? Predicting Action Progress in Video" by Federico Becattini et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their model's capability on the **UCF-101** and **J-HMDB** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are central to their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4, the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **J-HMDB Dataset**: This dataset consists of 21 action classes and 928 videos, annotated with body joints. The authors mention that all videos are temporally trimmed and contain only one action, which is crucial for understanding how the dataset is structured.

2. **UCF-101 Dataset**: This dataset contains 24 classes annotated for spatio-temporal action localization. The authors note that it is more challenging than J-HMDB because the actions are temporally untrimmed and can include multiple actions of the same class in a single video.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **J-HMDB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jhuang, H., Gall, J., Zuffi, S., Schmid, C., & Black, M. J. (2013). *Towards understanding action recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3192â€“3199.

- For the **UCF-101 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Soomro, K., Zamir, A. R., & Shah, M. (2012). *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402.

Having gathered this information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
