To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sentiment Analysis of Yelp Reviews: A Comparison of Techniques and Models" by Siqi Liu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract indicates that the study uses "over 350,000 Yelp reviews on 5,000 restaurants," which suggests that there is a significant dataset involved. The introduction further elaborates on the use of Yelp data, reinforcing the idea that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look into the **Data** section, specifically **section II**, where the author discusses the dataset preparation. Here, it is mentioned that the data is downloaded from the **Yelp Open Data website** and that the raw dataset contains "6.7 million reviews and ratings on 192,609 businesses." The author narrows the dataset down to reviews from businesses in the restaurant/food servicing industry located in the Greater Toronto Area, ultimately resulting in a final dataset of "362,554 reviews and ratings."

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the Yelp dataset itself, but it does reference the source as the **Yelp Open Data website**. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is publicly available from this source.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Yelp Reviews Dataset**: This dataset consists of 362,554 reviews and ratings from 5,406 restaurants in the Greater Toronto Area. The reviews are used for sentiment analysis, with ratings ranging from 1 to 5 stars.

For the citation, since the dataset is from the Yelp Open Data website, I will provide the following reference:

- **Yelp Open Data**: 
  > Yelp Inc. *Yelp Open Dataset*. Available at: https://www.yelp.com/dataset

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and completeness. This includes the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
