To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporally Coherent Full 3D Mesh Human Pose Recovery from Monocular Video" by Jian Liu, Naveed Akhtar, and Ajmal Mian, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors address the lack of appropriately annotated video data for learning deep models, which suggests that they may have created or utilized specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges in human pose recovery and the need for annotated data. They mention existing datasets but do not specify names yet. This section may provide context for the datasets they reference later.

In the **data generation section (Section 3)**, the authors describe their method for generating synthetic data with rich 3D annotations. They mention using the **CMU MoCap dataset** to provide a variety of natural poses and motions. This dataset is crucial for their work as it serves as the basis for generating their synthetic data.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if they mention any benchmark datasets used for evaluation. The authors reference **Human3.6M** and **UCF101** datasets in their analysis, which are well-known datasets in the field of human pose estimation.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **CMU MoCap Dataset**:
   > CMU Motion Capture Database. Available at: http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu.

2. **Human3.6M Dataset**:
   > Ionescu, C., Papava, D., Olaru, V., & Sminchisescu, C. (2014). Human3.6M: Large scale datasets and predictive methods for 3D human sensing in natural environments. *PAMI*, 36(7), 1325-1339.

3. **UCF101 Dataset**:
   > Soomro, K., Zamir, A. R., & Shah, M. (2012). UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402*.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as they are critical for proper attribution and further research.
