To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unique Faces Recognition in Videos" by Jiahao Huo and Terence L van Zyl, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the paper uses the **YouTube Faces Database** for face recognition in videos, which is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this case, the paper describes the YouTube Faces Database in detail in **section III.A (Dataset)**. Here, it specifies that the dataset is based on Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) identities and includes 3425 videos for 1595 unique subjects, with a total of 621126 frames extracted.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the YouTube Faces Database. The relevant citation is:

- For the **YouTube Faces Database**, the citation is:
  > Lior Wolf, Tal Hassner, and Itay Maoz. *Face recognition in unconstrained videos with matched background similarity*. In CVPR 2011, pages 529â€“534. IEEE, 2011.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the YouTube Faces Database, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete.
