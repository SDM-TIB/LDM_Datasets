To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Linguistic Analysis of Pretrained Sentence Encoders with Acceptability Judgments" by Alex Warstadt and Samuel R. Bowman, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new analysis dataset that augments the **Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA)**, which is a strong indicator that this dataset is significant.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the CoLA dataset in detail. They explain that CoLA consists of over 10,000 example sentences labeled for grammatical acceptability, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's purpose.

In the **analysis set section**, the authors describe their newly annotated version of the CoLA development set, which contains 1,043 sentences labeled with 13 classes of syntactic phenomena. This indicates that the authors have created a specific analysis dataset based on CoLA.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to confirm that the CoLA dataset and the newly annotated analysis set are indeed used in their experiments. The authors mention using CoLA for training acceptability classifiers, which further validates its importance.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA)**:
   > Warstadt, A., Singh, A., & Bowman, S. R. (2018). Neural network acceptability judgments. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.12471*.

2. **Grammatically Annotated CoLA Development Set**:
   - This is an augmentation of the original CoLA dataset, so I will reference it as a modified version of CoLA. The citation remains the same as above since it is based on the original dataset.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations in a clear and organized manner, ready for any further processing or review.
