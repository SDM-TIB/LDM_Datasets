To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evolutionary NAS with Gene Expression Programming of Cellular Encoding" by Cliford Broni-Bediako et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method was evaluated on the **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets, which suggests these are the primary datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section IV) to confirm the details about these datasets. The authors mention that they ran experiments on the **CIFAR-10** dataset and later transferred the best architecture to the **CIFAR-100** dataset. This confirms that both datasets are indeed used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The CIFAR datasets are well-known, so I will look for their authoritative sources:

1. For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

2. For the **CIFAR-100 dataset**, it is often cited similarly, as it is a variant of CIFAR-10:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

Both datasets are part of the same publication, so they share the same citation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
