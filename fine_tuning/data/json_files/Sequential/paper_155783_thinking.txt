To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LSTM based models stability in the context of Sentiment Analysis for social media" by Bousselham EL HADDAOUI et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, system description, and experiment sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the introduction and system description are likely to contain more specific details about the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the complexity of sentiment analysis and mention various components, but they do not specify any datasets yet. I will move on to the **system description**.

In the **system description**, the authors state that they constructed their dataset from a dataset used in the SemEval competition for sentiment analysis between 2013 and 2016. They mention that they gathered **50,133 tweets in English** with specific sentiment ratios (44.9% neutral, 39.5% positive, and 15.6% negative). This indicates that the dataset is based on tweets, but I need to find the exact name of the dataset.

Next, I will look at the **references** to find the original datasets mentioned. The authors cite several SemEval papers, which are likely the sources of the datasets they used. The relevant references are:

1. **SemEval-2013 Task 2**: This paper discusses sentiment analysis in Twitter and is likely the source for the dataset used in the experiments.

Wilson, “SemEval-2013 Task 2: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter,” in Second Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (*SEM), Volume 2: Proceedings of the Seventh International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2013), Atlanta, Georgia, USA, Jun. 2013, pp. 312–320. Available: https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S13-2052

2. **SemEval-2014 Task 9**: This paper also discusses sentiment analysis in Twitter and may provide additional context or datasets.
   - Citation: S. Rosenthal, A. Ritter, P. Nakov, and V. Stoyanov, “SemEval-2014 Task 9: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter,” in Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2014), Dublin, Ireland, Aug. 2014, pp. 73–80. doi: 10.3115/v1/S14-2009.

3. **SemEval-2015 Task 10**: This paper continues the trend of sentiment analysis in Twitter and may also be relevant.
   - Citation: S. Rosenthal, S. M. Mohammad, P. Nakov, A. Ritter, S. Kiritchenko, and V. Stoyanov, "SemEval-2015 Task 10: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter," ArXiv191202387 Cs, Dec. 2019. Available: http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02387

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: SemEval-2013 Task 2 Dataset
   - Description: A collection of 50,133 tweets in English used for sentiment analysis, with sentiment ratios of 44.9% neutral, 39.5% positive, and 15.6% negative.
   - Citation: P. Nakov, S. Rosenthal, Z. Kozareva, V. Stoyanov, A. Ritter, and T. Wilson, “SemEval-2013 Task 2: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter,” in Second Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (*SEM), Volume 2: Proceedings of the Seventh International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2013), Atlanta, Georgia, USA, Jun. 2013, pp. 312–320. Available: https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S13-2052

2. **Dataset Name**: SemEval-2014 Task 9 Dataset
   - Description: A dataset for sentiment analysis in Twitter, providing additional context for the experiments.
   - Citation: S. Rosenthal, A. Ritter, P. Nakov, and V. Stoyanov, “SemEval-2014 Task 9: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter,” in Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2014), Dublin, Ireland, Aug. 2014, pp. 73–80. doi: 10.3115/v1/S14-2009.

3. **Dataset Name**: SemEval-2015 Task 10 Dataset
   - Description: Another dataset for sentiment analysis in Twitter, relevant for the study.
   - Citation: S. Rosenthal, S. M. Mohammad, P. Nakov, A. Ritter, S. Kiritchenko, and V. Stoyanov, "SemEval-2015 Task 10: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter," ArXiv191202387 Cs, Dec. 2019. Available: http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02387

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries for further processing.
