To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepSTCL: A Deep Spatio-temporal ConvLSTM for Travel Demand Prediction" by Dongjie Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors used a "real dataset" for their experiments, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **dataset and preprocessing section (Section B)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used. Here, they refer to the **DIDI order data**, which is supplied by DIDI Gaia Plan. The authors describe the dataset as covering all order and GPS data in Chengdu for November 2016, providing details about the contents of each order.

I will note the key characteristics of the dataset:
- It includes order ID, start billing time, end billing time, pick-up and drop-off longitude, and latitude.
- The data is divided into geographical blocks (74x74), resulting in 5476 blocks, each representing a 1 kmÂ² area.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will check the **References section**. The authors cite the DIDI dataset as follows:
> Data from https://gaia.didichuxing.com, retrieved 2017-11-09/2017-12-01.

This citation is crucial as it provides the source of the dataset.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. 

In summary, the steps I followed are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the dataset section for detailed descriptions.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references.
4. Compile the dataset information for clarity and completeness.

This methodical approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant dataset information from the paper.
