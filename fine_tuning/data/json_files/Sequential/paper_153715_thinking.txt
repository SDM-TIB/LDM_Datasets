To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ordering Chaos: Memory-Aware Scheduling of Irregularly Wired Neural Networks for Edge Devices" by Byung Hoon Ahn et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used. The methodology section typically details the experiments conducted, including any datasets employed.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of "irregularly wired neural networks" and refer to various neural architecture search (NAS) methods. However, I need to look for specific datasets that were utilized in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **evaluation section**, specifically **Table 1**, which lists the networks used for evaluation along with their corresponding datasets. Here, I find the following datasets:

1. **ImageNet**: Used for evaluating the DARTS network, which is a well-known dataset for image classification tasks.
2. **HPD (Human Presence Detection)**: This dataset is used for evaluating the SwiftNet network, focusing on human detection.
3. **CIFAR10**: A widely used dataset for image classification, employed in the RandWire network.
4. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes, also used in the RandWire network.

Now, I will look up the full citations for these datasets in the **References section** of the paper or through external sources if necessary.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009.

- For **HPD (Human Presence Detection)**, I will need to check if the authors provide a specific reference or if it is a dataset they created. If no citation is provided, I will note it as an internal dataset.

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical Report, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
