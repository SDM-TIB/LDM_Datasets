To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Model Ensemble for Suggestion Mining" by Samuel Pecar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but the evaluation section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used.

In the **evaluation section (3)**, specifically in **subsection 3.1 (Dataset)**, the authors describe the dataset used for the suggestion mining task. They mention that the dataset consists of feedback posts from the Universal Windows Platform available on uservoice.com. This is a clear indication that a specific dataset is being utilized.

The authors provide additional details about the dataset, including:
- The dataset contains approximately 9,000 text samples for training.
- There are around 600 samples for validation in subtask A and 800 samples for subtask B.
- The test datasets consist of approximately 800 samples for subtask A and 1,000 samples for subtask B.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. However, since the dataset is derived from user-generated content on uservoice.com, it may not have a formal citation like traditional datasets. Instead, I will note the source as follows:

- **Universal Windows Platform Feedback Dataset**: 
  > The dataset consists of feedback posts available on uservoice.com, specifically for the Universal Windows Platform. 

Since there are no additional datasets mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name and its source.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their respective citations for future reference or processing.
