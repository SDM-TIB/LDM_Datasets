To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Wake Word Detection with Streaming Transformers" by Yiming Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **Mobvoi wake word dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (The Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used in their experiments. Here, they describe the **Mobvoi (SLR87) dataset**, which includes two wake words: "Hi Xiaowen" and "Nihao Wenwen." The section specifies that the dataset contains 144 hours of training data and 74 hours of test data, along with the number of positive examples.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The authors reference the Mobvoi dataset as follows:

- For the **Mobvoi (SLR87) dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mobvoi. *SLR87: A Large-Scale Wake Word Detection Dataset*. Available at: https://www.openslr.org/87.

Since this is a specific dataset used in their experiments, I will include this citation in my dataset entry.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation as required. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the dataset from the research paper.
