To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Emotion-cause pair extraction method based on multi-module interaction" by Mingrui Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed model is evaluated on the **ECPE benchmark dataset**, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In the **experiments section**, the authors state that they evaluate their method on the **ECPE benchmark dataset**, constructed by Xia et al. This is a clear indication that this dataset is central to their research.

I will also check the **related work section** and **references** to find any additional datasets or to confirm the citation for the ECPE benchmark dataset. The authors reference the original work by Xia et al. for the dataset, which is crucial for proper citation.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

1. **ECPE Benchmark Dataset**: This dataset is constructed based on the Chinese Emotion-causes Corpus, consisting of 1945 documents. It is specifically designed for the task of emotion-cause pair extraction.

Next, I will retrieve the full citation for the dataset from the references section:

- For the **ECPE benchmark dataset**, the citation is:
  > R Xia, Z Ding, et al. *Emotion-cause pair extraction: A new task to emotion analysis in texts*. In Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 1003â€“1012, 2019.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the dataset and its citation, ready for inclusion in any structured output or further processing.
