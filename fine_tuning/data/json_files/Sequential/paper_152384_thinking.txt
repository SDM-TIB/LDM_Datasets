To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast and Accurate Recurrent Neural Network Acoustic Models for Speech Recognition" by HasÂ¸im Sak et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses improvements in LSTM RNN acoustic models for speech recognition, but it does not specify datasets. The introduction provides context about the advancements in speech recognition but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their training and evaluation process. Here, they mention that the training set consists of **3 million utterances** taken from real 16kHz Google voice search traffic. This indicates that the dataset is based on actual user interactions, which is significant for speech recognition research.

In this section, they also mention that the test set consists of **28,000 utterances**, which were distorted once with held-out noise samples. This further confirms the presence of a dataset used for evaluation.

Now, I will look for any references to the datasets in the **References section** to provide full citations. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset derived from Google voice search traffic, as it is likely proprietary data. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is based on internal Google data without a formal citation.

The authors also mention using noise from YouTube videos for synthetic distortion, but this does not constitute a dataset in the traditional sense that would require a citation.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **Google Voice Search Dataset**: Comprising 3 million utterances for training and 28,000 utterances for testing, derived from real user interactions.

Since there are no formal citations for this dataset, I will note that it is based on proprietary data from Google.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
