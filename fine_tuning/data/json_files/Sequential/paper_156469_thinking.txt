To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Automatic Modulation Recognition through Robust Global Feature Extraction" by Yunpeng Qu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that their method achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely-used datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any mentions of datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **RadioML2016.10a**: This dataset is described as containing various modulation types such as 8PSK, BPSK, and QAM16, among others. The authors mention that the signals in this dataset are synthetically generated and captured using GNU Radio.

2. **RadioML2018.01a**: Similar to the previous dataset, this one includes a broader range of modulation types and is also generated using a signal generator and captured with GNU Radio.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors provide additional details about the datasets, including the number of samples and signal lengths, which further confirms their usage in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **RadioML2016.10a**, the citation is:
  > O'Shea, T. J., & West, N. (2016). Radio machine learning dataset generation with GNU Radio. In Proceedings of the GNU Radio Conference, vol. 1, no. 1.

- For **RadioML2018.01a**, the citation is:
  > O'Shea, T. J., & West, N. (2018). RadioML dataset generation with GNU Radio. In Proceedings of the GNU Radio Conference, vol. 2, no. 1.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
