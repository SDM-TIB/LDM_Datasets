To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamical Isometry and a Mean Field Theory of LSTMs and GRUs" by Dar Gilboa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for validation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experiments section typically details the datasets employed in the study.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that the authors might have used to validate their findings. If the authors mention specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section usually contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for subsections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." Here, I will identify any datasets mentioned, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant details that describe how they were used in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **MNIST dataset**, I would look for its citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

If the paper discusses another dataset, such as **CIFAR-10**, I would find its citation as well:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 Dataset*. 2009.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately represented each dataset's details and citations, as this is essential for the integrity of the research and for facilitating further studies in the field.
