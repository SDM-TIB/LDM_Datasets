To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning via Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for predicting strains in Railway Bridge members under train induced vibration" by Amartya Dutta and Kamaljyoti Nath, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that strain data from a previous study conducted by IIT Guwahati is utilized, which suggests that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more specific details.

Next, I will examine the **Description of Test Bridge and Data** section. Here, the authors describe the data collection process, mentioning that strain data were collected from a railway bridge over four years while trains passed over it. This section does not provide a specific dataset name but confirms the existence of a dataset related to strain measurements.

I will also look for any **tables or figures** that might summarize the data or provide additional context. The paper includes figures showing strain time histories, which may help in understanding the dataset's structure and content.

In the **Acknowledgment** section, the authors mention the support of the Department of Civil Engineering at IIT Guwahati and reference a project number related to the data collection. This could be useful for citation purposes.

Finally, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the dataset. The authors reference several studies that may have used similar datasets or methodologies, but I need to ensure that I accurately capture the citation for the dataset used in this study.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile the dataset details, including the full citation for the strain data collected from the railway bridge. The citation for the dataset will be:

> Dutta, A., & Nath, K. (2023). Learning via Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for predicting strains in Railway Bridge members under train induced vibration. *Indian Institute of Information Technology, Guwahati, India*.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation as required. The dataset consists of strain measurements collected from various members of a railway bridge over a period of four years, with data collected during the passage of trains at different speeds.

After compiling this information, I will prepare it for structured output, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or analysis.
