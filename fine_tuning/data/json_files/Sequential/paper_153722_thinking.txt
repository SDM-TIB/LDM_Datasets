To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Searching Central Difference Convolutional Networks for Face Anti-Spoofing" by Zitong Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract states that "comprehensive experiments are performed on six benchmark datasets," which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details. Here, the authors mention the importance of face anti-spoofing and refer to various datasets used in their experiments. This section may provide context on the datasets' relevance to the study.

I will then focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. The paper mentions six datasets:

1. **OULU-NPU**: A mobile face presentation attack database with real-world variations.
2. **SiW**: A dataset designed for face anti-spoofing with various protocols.
3. **CASIA-MFSD**: A dataset containing low-resolution videos for face anti-spoofing.
4. **Replay-Attack**: Another dataset for testing face anti-spoofing methods.
5. **MSU-MFSD**: A dataset used for cross-dataset testing in face anti-spoofing.
6. **SiW-M**: A dataset designed for cross-type testing with multiple attack types.

In this section, I will also look for any specific details about each dataset, such as the number of samples, types of attacks included, and any unique characteristics that may be relevant.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The citations may look like this:

Finally, I will compile the dataset information and their citations into a structured format for easy reference and use in future research or applications. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the study.
