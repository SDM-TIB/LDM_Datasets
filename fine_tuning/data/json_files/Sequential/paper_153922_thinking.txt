To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BEEP! Korean Corpus of Online News Comments for Toxic Speech Detection" by Jihyung Moon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors present a dataset of **9.4K manually labeled entertainment news comments** for identifying Korean toxic speech. This indicates that a dataset is indeed provided.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant subsections that detail the dataset's characteristics. In this paper, the dataset is discussed in the **Corpus** section, where the authors describe the construction of the Korean hate speech corpus. They mention that the dataset consists of **9.4K comments** from online entertainment news articles, annotated for social bias and hate speech.

I will also check the **methodology** and **experiments** sections to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors refer to any other datasets used for comparison or benchmarking. However, the primary focus here is on the dataset they created.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the dataset mentioned in the paper. The authors do not provide a formal citation for their dataset in the references, but they do mention that it is publicly available on GitHub and Kaggle. Therefore, I will create a citation based on the information provided in the paper:

- For the **Korean Corpus of Online News Comments**, the citation is:
  > Jihyung Moon, Won Ik Cho, and Junbum Lee. *BEEP! Korean Corpus of Online News Comments for Toxic Speech Detection*. Available at: https://github.com/kocohub/korean-hate-speech (Accessed: 2023).

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including its description and citation, into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and provided the necessary citations for future reference.
