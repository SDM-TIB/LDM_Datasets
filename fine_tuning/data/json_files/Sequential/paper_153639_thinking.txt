To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dual Convolutional LSTM Network for Referring Image Segmentation" by Linwei Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "four challenging datasets," which indicates that there are multiple datasets to identify.

Next, I will look specifically at **section VI (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section is likely to provide detailed information about each dataset, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study.

In section VI-A, the authors list the datasets as follows:

1. **Google-Ref Dataset**: This dataset consists of 104,560 expressions referring to 54,822 objects across 26,711 images. The images and ground truth masks are sourced from the MS COCO dataset, and the referring expressions are annotated via Amazon Mechanical Turk.

2. **UNC Dataset**: Based on the MS COCO dataset, this dataset contains 19,994 images with 142,209 referring expressions for 50,000 objects. It was gathered through a two-player game where one player annotates the image region based on the expression provided by the other player.

3. **UNC+ Dataset**: Similar to the UNC dataset, it includes 141,564 expressions for 49,856 objects across 19,992 images. The key difference is that location information is not allowed in the referring expressions, relying solely on appearance and context descriptions.

4. **Referit Dataset**: Built on the IAPR TC-12 dataset, this dataset includes 130,525 expressions referring to 96,654 object masks in 19,894 images. Like the UNC datasets, it was also collected using a two-player game format.

After identifying the datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Google-Ref Dataset**:
  > Mao, J., Huang, J., Toshev, A., Camburu, O., Yuille, A. L., & Murphy, K. (2016). *Generation and comprehension of unambiguous object descriptions*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 11-20.

- For the **UNC Dataset**:
  > Yu, L., Poirson, P., Yang, S., Berg, A. C., & Berg, T. L. (2016). *Modeling context in referring expressions*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pp. 69-85.

- For the **UNC+ Dataset**:
  > Yu, L., Poirson, P., Yang, S., Berg, A. C., & Berg, T. L. (2016). *Modeling context in referring expressions*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pp. 69-85. (Note: This dataset is closely related to the UNC dataset, so the citation is the same.)

- For the **Referit Dataset**:
  > Kazemzadeh, S., Ordonez, V., Matten, M., & Berg, T. L. (2014). *Referitgame: Referring to objects in photographs of natural scenes*. In Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 787-798.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
