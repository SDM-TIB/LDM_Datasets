To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Event-based Temporally Dense Optical Flow Estimation with Sequential Learning" by Wachirawit Ponghiran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of event cameras and mentions the DSEC dataset, which is a strong indication that it is a primary dataset used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 4.1) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they specifically mention the **DSEC dataset** as the primary dataset for their experiments, highlighting its features such as high-resolution events and optical flow ground truths.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the DSEC dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Mathias Gehrig, Willem Aarents, Daniel Gehrig, and Davide Scaramuzza. *DSEC: A stereo event camera dataset for driving scenarios*. In IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 6(3):4947â€“4954, 2021.

Since the DSEC dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format.

Now, I will summarize the findings:
1. **DSEC Dataset**: This dataset is used for training and testing the proposed models, containing high-resolution events and optical flow ground truths from various driving scenarios.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the dataset name and its full citation for future reference or processing.
