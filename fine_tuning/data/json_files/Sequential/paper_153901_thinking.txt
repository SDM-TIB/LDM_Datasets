To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An LSTM approach to Forecast Migration using Google Trends" by Nicolas Golenvaux et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors use Google Trends data along with economic and demographic data for forecasting migration. This suggests that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will examine **section 3.1 (Data and features sets)**, where the authors describe the features used for their models. They mention using Google Trends data, specifically the Google Trends Index (GTI), which is derived from a set of keywords related to migration. This section also references the OECD International Migration Database, which provides migration flow data.

In this section, I will note the following datasets:

1. **Google Trends Data**: The authors utilize Google Trends data to capture the relative search volumes of specific keywords related to migration. They mention that the GTI is calculated for the period from 2004 to 2014.

2. **OECD International Migration Database**: This dataset provides yearly incoming migration flows from 101 countries of origin to 35 OECD countries from the early 1980s until 2015.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Google Trends data**, while the paper does not provide a formal citation, it can be referenced as:
  > Google. 2020. Google Trends. https://www.google.com/trends.

- For the **OECD International Migration Database**, the citation is:
  > OECD. 2020. International Migration Database. https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/content/data/data-00342-en.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and can be easily referenced in future work.
