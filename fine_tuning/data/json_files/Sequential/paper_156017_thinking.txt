To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Virtual Simulation-Pilot Agent for Training of Air Traffic Controllers" by Juan Zuluaga-Gomez et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the study. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, which is explicitly dedicated to describing the datasets used in the research. This section will likely contain detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their purpose, characteristics, and any relevant statistics.

In **section 3.1 (Public databases)**, the paper lists several public datasets:

1. **LDC-ATCC corpus**: This dataset consists of recorded speech designed for research on ASR, containing approximately 25 hours of ATCo and pilot transmissions. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Godfrey, J. The Air Traffic Control Corpus (ATC0) - LDC94S14A, 1994.

2. **UWB-ATCC corpus**: A free resource for research on ATC, containing 13 hours of manually transcribed communication. The citation is:
   > UWB-ATCC. Corpus released by the University of West Bohemia: https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11858/00-097C-0000-0001-CCA1-0.

3. **ATCO2 corpus**: This dataset is used for ASR and NLP technologies for English ATC communications, comprising 2500 hours of audio data. The citation is:
   > Zuluaga-Gomez, J.; Veselý, K.; Szöke, I.; Motlicek, P.; Kocour, M.; Rigault, M.; Choukri, K.; Prasad, A.; Sarfjoo, S.S.; Nigmatulina, I.; et al. ATCO2 corpus: A Large-Scale Dataset for Research on Automatic Speech Recognition and Natural Language Understanding of Air Traffic Control Communications. arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.04054 2022.

4. **ATCOSIM corpus**: A public database for ATC communications, comprising 10 hours of speech data. The citation is:
   > Hofbauer, K.; Petrik, S.; Hering, H. The ATCOSIM Corpus of Non-Prompted Clean Air Traffic Control Speech. In Proceedings of the LREC, 2008.

In **section 3.2 (Private databases)**, the paper describes private datasets:

1. **MALORCA corpus**: This dataset contains around 14 hours of speech data from Prague and Vienna airports. The citation is:
   > MALORCA corpus. MAchine Learning Of speech Recognition models for Controller Assistance: http://www.malorca-project.de/wp/.

2. **HAAWAII corpus**: This dataset includes approximately 47 hours of manually transcribed data from two Air Navigation Service Providers. The citation is:
   > HAAWAII corpus. Highly Advanced Air Traffic Controller Workstation with Artificial Intelligence Integration: https://www.haawaii.de.

3. **Internal data**: This dataset consists of 44 hours of speech recordings from industrial research projects. The citation is not explicitly provided, but it can be referenced as:
   > Internal data from various industrial research projects.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, which can be useful for future studies or applications in the field of air traffic control training.
