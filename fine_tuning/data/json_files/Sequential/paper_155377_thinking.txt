To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Iranian Modal Music (Dastgah) Detection Using Deep Neural Networks" by Danial Ebrat et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of the **Nava dataset**, which is a key indicator that a dataset is involved. I will note this down as it is likely the primary dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** section, specifically **section 5 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they describe the **Nava dataset** in depth, stating that it includes 1786 records and up to 55 hours of music played solo by various artists using five known Iranian instruments. This section confirms the dataset's significance and provides additional context about its composition and purpose.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Nava dataset**. The authors reference it as follows:

- **Nava Dataset**: 
  > A. G. Mohammadi and A. F. Dizaji, “Nava: A Persian Traditional Music Database for the Dastgah and Instrument Recognition Tasks,” J. Adv. Signal Process., vol. 3, no. 2, pp. 125–134, 2020. Available: https://www.magiran.com/paper/2118347.

Since the paper primarily discusses the **Nava dataset**, I will focus on this dataset for my extraction. 

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format that highlights the dataset's key attributes, including its name, description, and citation.

In summary, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and citation, which is crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work or analysis.
