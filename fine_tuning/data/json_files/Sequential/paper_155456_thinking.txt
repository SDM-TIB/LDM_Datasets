To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Use of BERT for Automated Essay Scoring: Joint Learning of Multi-Scale Essay Representation" by Yongjie Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on the **ASAP** dataset and the **CommonLit Readability Prize (CRP)** dataset, which suggests that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments** section. In **section 4.1 (Data and Evaluation)**, the authors provide a description of the **ASAP dataset**, which contains eight different prompts for essay scoring, and the **CRP dataset**, which includes excerpts with readability scores. This confirms that both datasets are used in their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper. 

1. For the **ASAP dataset**, the citation is:
   > Phandi, P., Chai, K. M. A., & Ng, H. T. (2015). Flexible domain adaptation for automated essay scoring using correlated linear regression. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 431â€“439.

2. For the **CommonLit Readability Prize dataset**, the citation is:
   > The CommonLit Readability Prize. (2020). CommonLit Readability Prize Dataset. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/c/commonlitreadabilityprize/data.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation.

In summary, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the paper, including their full citations, to maintain the integrity of the research and provide proper credit to the original sources.
