To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MTL-NAS: Task-Agnostic Neural Architecture Search towards General-Purpose Multi-Task Learning" by Yuan Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions performing extensive experiments using different single-task backbones on various task sets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 5)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their evaluations. They specifically mention using the **NYU v2 dataset** and the **Taskonomy dataset** for their experiments. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in this section.

In **Section 5.2**, the authors describe the NYU v2 dataset, stating that it is used for semantic segmentation and surface normal estimation, with ground truth for 40 classes of semantic labeling. They also mention that the surface normal is precomputed from the depth map.

In **Section 5.3**, they discuss the Taskonomy dataset, noting that it is significantly larger than ImageNet and is used for object classification and scene classification tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **NYU v2 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Nathan Silberman, Derek Hoiem, Pushmeet Kohli, and Rob Fergus. *Indoor segmentation and support inference from RGB-D images*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2012.

2. For the **Taskonomy dataset**, the citation is:
   > Amir R. Zamir, Alexander Sax, William B. Shen, Leonidas J. Guibas, Jitendra Malik, and Silvio Savarese. *Taskonomy: Disentangling task transfer learning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

With these citations, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

- **NYU v2 dataset**: Used for semantic segmentation and surface normal estimation.
- **Taskonomy dataset**: Used for object classification and scene classification tasks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
