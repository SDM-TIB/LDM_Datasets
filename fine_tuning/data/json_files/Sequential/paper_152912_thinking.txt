To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Learning of Filter-Level Heterogeneous Compression of Convolutional Neural Networks" by Yochai Zur et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in previous works.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3 and Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using **ResNet-20 on CIFAR-10** for their quantization experiments. This indicates that CIFAR-10 is a dataset utilized in their research.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details regarding datasets, as sometimes supplementary information is provided there. However, in this case, the main datasets are likely already mentioned in the main sections.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citation for CIFAR-10 is as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Masterâ€™s thesis, Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, 2009. URL: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.222.9220.

Since CIFAR-10 is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

After gathering all relevant information, I will ensure that the dataset entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation, ready for further processing or review.
