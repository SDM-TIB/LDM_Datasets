To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Matching Models with Hierarchical Contextualized Representations for Multi-turn Response Selection" by Chongyang Tao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **two benchmark conversation datasets**, which suggests that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they refer to:

1. **Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus**: This dataset is described as being collected from chat logs of the Ubuntu Forum, containing 1 million context-response pairs for training, 0.5 million for validation, and 0.5 million for testing.

2. **Douban Conversation Corpus**: This is a multi-turn Chinese conversation dataset consisting of 1 million context-response pairs for training, 50,000 for validation, and 6,670 for testing.

To ensure I have the correct details, I will also check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Lowe, R., Pow, N., Serban, I., & Pineau, J. (2015). *The Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus: A large dataset for research in unstructured multi-turn dialogue systems*. In Proceedings of the 16th Annual Meeting of the Special Interest Group on Discourse and Dialogue (pp. 285–294).

- For the **Douban Conversation Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Y., Wu, W., Xing, C., Zhou, M., & Li, Z. (2017). *Sequential matching network: A new architecture for multi-turn response selection in retrieval-based chatbots*. In ACL (pp. 496–505).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
