To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long Short-Term Memory Networks for CSI300 Volatility Prediction with Baidu Search Volume" by Yu-Long Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected daily search volume data from Baidu for 28 keywords related to finance, which suggests that this data is a primary dataset used in their analysis.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Data description and preprocessing)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets they used. Here, they mention the collection of daily search volume data from Baidu Index, specifically from June 1, 2006, to October 29, 2017. They also list the 28 keywords used for this data collection, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

In this section, I will note the following key points:
- The dataset consists of daily search volumes for 28 finance-related keywords.
- The data is manually collected and cannot be downloaded directly from Baidu Index.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **methods** or **results** sections, but it appears that the primary dataset is the Baidu search volume data.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Baidu Index data. However, since the dataset is based on a proprietary source (Baidu), it may not have a formal citation like traditional datasets. Instead, I will note that the dataset is derived from the Baidu Index, which is referenced in the paper.

The citation for the paper itself is:
> Yu-Long Zhou, Ren-Jie Han, Qian Xu, Wei-Ke Zhang. *Long Short-Term Memory Networks for CSI300 Volatility Prediction with Baidu Search Volume*. 

Since the dataset is based on the Baidu Index, I will summarize it as follows:
- **Baidu Search Volume Data**: This dataset includes daily search volumes for 28 finance-related keywords collected manually from Baidu Index from June 1, 2006, to October 29, 2017.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the relevant citations and descriptions for clarity and completeness. This will prepare the dataset entries for any required structured output or further analysis.
