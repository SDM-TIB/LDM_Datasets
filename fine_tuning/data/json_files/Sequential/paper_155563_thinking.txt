To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A General Contextualized Rewriting Framework for Text Summarization" by Guangsheng Bao and Yue Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for evaluation or comparison.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Experiments," "Datasets," or "Methodology."** In this paper, the authors mention using the **CNN/DailyMail dataset** for evaluation, which is a well-known benchmark for text summarization tasks.

In the **Experiments section**, the authors provide details about the dataset, stating that it comprises **312,085 online news articles** with an average of **766 words per article** and human-written highlights with an average of **3.75 sentences per sample.** This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CNN/DailyMail dataset. The citation is typically formatted according to the publication style used in the paper. In this case, the authors do not provide a specific citation for the dataset within the text, but I can refer to the original paper that introduced the dataset:

- For the **CNN/DailyMail dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hermann, K. M., Kocisk√Ω, T., Grefenstette, E., Espeholt, L., Kay, W., Suleyman, M., & Blunsom, P. (2015). Teaching machines to read and comprehend. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28 (pp. 1693-1701).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation in the required format.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for any further processing or review, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete.
