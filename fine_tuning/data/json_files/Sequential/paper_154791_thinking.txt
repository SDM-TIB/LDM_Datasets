To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3D Tensor-based Deep Learning Models for Predicting Option Price" by Muyang Ge et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that experiments were performed on the **Chinese market option dataset**, which indicates that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.1 (Experimental data)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that the dataset consists of **50ETF option and stock option data collected from the Chinese stock and fund market from April 2018 to June 2020**. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including the number of observations and variables.

The authors specify that the original dataset contains **55,047 observations and 34 variables**, and after filtering for options with an effective period of at least 20 days, they are left with **829 options**. They further clarify that they used **600 options as training data** and **229 options as test data**, resulting in **33,210 observations for training** and **11,386 observations for testing**.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from Yahoo Finance and does not have a formal citation like a published dataset, I will note that the data was acquired from Yahoo Finance and provide the URL for reference.

The relevant dataset information I will compile is as follows:

1. **Chinese Market Option Dataset**: This dataset includes options data from the Chinese stock and fund market, specifically focusing on 50ETF options and stock options. It consists of 55,047 observations and 34 variables, filtered down to 829 options for the study.

The citation for this dataset will be:
> Data acquired from Yahoo Finance. Available at: https://finance.yahoo.com

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset derived from Yahoo Finance.
