To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeFINE: Embeddings for Neural Sequence Modeling" by Sachin Mehta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed method on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely included in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (Section 4), as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors mention two specific datasets used for their experiments:

1. **WikiText-103**: This dataset is described as consisting of 103 million tokens across training, validation, and test sets, with a vocabulary size of about 260,000. It is composed of Wikipedia articles and retains punctuation, numbers, and case.

2. **Penn Treebank**: The Penn Treebank dataset is noted to contain approximately 929,000 tokens for training, 74,000 for validation, and 82,000 for testing, with a vocabulary size of about 10,000. The authors mention using a processed version of this dataset.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **WikiText-103**, the citation is:
  > Stephen Merity, Caiming Xiong, James Bradbury, and Richard Socher. *Pointer sentinel mixture models*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2017.

- For **Penn Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Mitchell Marcus, Grace Kim, Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz, Robert MacIntyre, Ann Bies, Mark Ferguson, Karen Katz, and Britta Schasberger. *The Penn Treebank: Annotating predicate argument structure*. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Human Language Technology, HLT â€™94, 1994.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
