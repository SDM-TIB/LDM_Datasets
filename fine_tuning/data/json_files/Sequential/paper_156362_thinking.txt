To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Hyperparameter-Agnostic DNN Training via Dynamical System Insights" by Carmel Fiscko et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to training on **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, which indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 6) to gather more details about the datasets. Here, the authors explicitly mention training DNN models on **MNIST**, **CIFAR-10**, and a dataset related to **household power consumption**. This confirms the presence of these datasets.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The relevant citations are:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: 
   > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: 
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2009.

3. **CIFAR-100 Dataset**: 
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2009.

4. **Household Power Consumption Dataset**: 
   > George Hebrail and Alice Berard. *Individual household electric power consumption data set*. Aug 2012.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. Each dataset will be documented with its name, description, and full citation to ensure proper attribution.
