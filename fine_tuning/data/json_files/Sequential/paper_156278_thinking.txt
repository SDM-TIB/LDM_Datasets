To extract datasets from the research paper titled "No Imputation Needed: A Switch Approach to Irregularly Sampled Time Series" by Rohit Agarwal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention demonstrating the efficacy of their model on **two public datasets**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors specifically state that they validate their model on **MIMIC-III** and **Physionet 2012** datasets. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

I will then look into the **experiments section**, where the authors provide more details about the datasets. They mention that both datasets are used for a mortality prediction task and provide some statistics about them, such as the number of instances and features. This confirms the datasets' relevance and usage in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **MIMIC-III**, the citation is:
  > Johnson, A. E. W., Pollard, T. J., Shen, L., Lehman, L.-w. H., Feng, M., Ghassemi, M., Moody, B., Szolovits, P., Anthony Celi, L., and Mark, R. G. (2016). MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database. *Scientific Data*, 3(1): 1–9.

- For **Physionet 2012**, the citation is:
  > Goldberger, A. L., Amaral, L. A., Glass, L., Hausdorff, J. M., Ivanov, P. C., Mark, R. G., Mietus, J. E., Moody, G. B., Peng, C.-K., and Stanley, H. E. (2000). PhysioBank, PhysioToolkit, and PhysioNet: components of a new research resource for complex physiologic signals. *Circulation*, 101(23): e215–e220.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **MIMIC-III**: A dataset of patient stays in critical care, containing physiological measurements and used for mortality prediction.
2. **Physionet 2012**: A dataset from the Physionet Mortality Prediction Challenge, containing measurements taken during the first 48 hours of ICU stays, also used for mortality prediction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
