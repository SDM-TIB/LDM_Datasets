To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Animal Behavior Classification via Accelerometry Data and Recurrent Neural Networks" by Liang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to get an overview of the research context and the datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their models using **four datasets acquired from cattle via collar or ear tags**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Datasets)**, as this section is dedicated to describing the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors mention four datasets:

1. **Arm18**: Collected in August 2018 from ten steers wearing collar tags at CSIRO's FD McMaster Laboratory. The dataset includes accelerometry data with annotations for four behavior classes: grazing, ruminating, resting, and other.

2. **Arm20c**: Collected in March 2020 from seven cattle using collar tags. This dataset also includes three behavior classes: grazing, ruminating/resting, and other.

3. **Arm20e**: Similar to Arm20c but collected using ear tags. It includes the same three behavior classes as Arm20c.

4. **Lan19**: Collected in September 2019 from nineteen cattle wearing collar tags at a different research facility. This dataset includes four behavior classes: grazing, walking, ruminating/resting, and other.

I will also note the details about how the data was collected, including the types of tags used and the sampling rates, as these details may be relevant for understanding the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites previous works that describe the data collection methods and the datasets themselves. 

For the datasets, I will provide the following citations based on the references mentioned in the paper:

- For **Arm18**, the citation is:
  > Arablouei, R., Currie, L., Kusy, B., Ingham, A. P. L., Greenwood, P. L., & Bishop-Hurley, G. (2021). In-situ classification of cattle behavior using accelerometry data. *Computers and Electronics in Agriculture*, 183, 106045.

- For **Arm20c** and **Arm20e**, the citation is the same as Arm18, as they are part of the same research effort.

- For **Lan19**, the citation is:
  > Rahman, A., Smith, D., Bishop-Hurley, G. J., Hills, J., Shahriar, S., Henry, D., & Rawnsley, R. (2018). Cattle behaviour classification from collar, halter, and ear tag sensors. *Information Processing in Agriculture*, 5(2), 124-133.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary information regarding the datasets used in the research.
