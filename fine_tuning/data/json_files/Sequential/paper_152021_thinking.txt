To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Probabilistic Model for Non-projective MST Parsing" by Xuezhe Ma and Eduard Hovy, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the model on **17 different datasets across 14 different languages**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) to identify specific datasets used in the evaluations. In section 4.1, the authors mention that they evaluate their parser on the **English Penn Treebank (PTB version 3.0)**, the **Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB version 5.1)**, and the **German CoNLL 2009 corpus**. This gives me the names of three datasets directly.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **English Penn Treebank (PTB version 3.0)**:
   > Marcus, M., Santorini, B., & Marcinkiewicz, M. A. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: the Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313-330.

2. **Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB version 5.1)**:
   > Xue, N., Chiou, F. D., & Palmer, M. (2002). Building a large-scale annotated Chinese corpus. In *Proceedings of COLING-2002* (pp. 1-8).

3. **German CoNLL 2009 corpus**:
   > Hajič, J., Ciaramita, M., Johansson, R., Kawahara, D., Marti, M. A., Marquez, L., Meyers, A., Nivre, J., Padó, S., & Štěpánek, J. (2009). The CoNLL-2009 shared task: Syntactic and semantic dependencies in multiple languages. In *Proceedings of CoNLL-2009: Shared Task* (pp. 1-18).

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately noted the details for each dataset, including their specific use in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ready for further processing or review.
