To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PixelRNN: In-pixel Recurrent Neural Networks for End-to-end-optimized Perception with Neural Sensors" by Haley M. So et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their method using datasets for hand gesture recognition and lip reading, which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they state:

1. **Cambridge Hand Gesture Recognition Dataset**: This dataset consists of 900 video clips of 9 gesture classes, with each class containing 100 videos. This dataset is crucial for the hand gesture recognition task.

2. **Tulips1 Dataset**: This dataset is described as a small audiovisual database featuring 12 subjects saying the first four digits in English. This dataset is used for the lip reading task.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Cambridge Hand Gesture Recognition Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Javier R. Movellan. *Visual speech recognition with stochastic networks*. In NIPS, 1994.

- For the **Tulips1 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > [41] Javier R. Movellan. *Visual speech recognition with stochastic networks*. In NIPS, 1994. (Note: The Tulips1 dataset is referenced in the context of the same citation as the hand gesture dataset.)

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Cambridge Hand Gesture Recognition Dataset**: A dataset consisting of 900 video clips across 9 gesture classes, with 100 videos per class.
   - Citation: Movellan, J. R. (1994). *Visual speech recognition with stochastic networks*. In NIPS.

2. **Tulips1 Dataset**: A small audiovisual database featuring 12 subjects saying the first four digits in English.
   - Citation: Movellan, J. R. (1994). *Visual speech recognition with stochastic networks*. In NIPS.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
