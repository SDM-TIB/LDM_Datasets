To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Chinese User Service Intention Classification Based on Hybrid Neural Network" by Shengbin Jia and Yang Xiang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenge of user service intention recognition but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) closely, as it often contains information about the datasets used for training and testing the models. In this section, the authors mention using data provided by the **SMP2017 Conference** for their experiments. This indicates that there is a specific dataset associated with this conference.

I will also look for any tables or figures that might provide additional details about the dataset. In **Table II**, the authors present statistics of the released data for the corpus, which includes the number of records for training, validation, and testing across various categories. This table suggests that the dataset is structured around user intents, but I need to confirm the full citation for the dataset.

To find the full citation for the dataset, I will refer to the **References section**. The authors mention the SMP2017 Conference in the experiments section, so I will look for the corresponding reference in the bibliography. The citation for the dataset is likely to be:

> SMP2017 Conference. *SMP2017 ECDT Dataset*. Available at: http://ir.hit.edu.cn/SMP2017-ECDT

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **SMP2017 ECDT Dataset**: This dataset is used for user service intention classification and includes various categories of user intents, such as chit-chat and task-oriented dialogue. The dataset contains a total of 4000 records, divided into training, validation, and test sets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution.
