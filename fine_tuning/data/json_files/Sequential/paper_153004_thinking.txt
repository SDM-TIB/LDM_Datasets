To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transcribing Content from Structural Images with Spotlight Mechanism" by Yu Yin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "many structural image datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Preliminaries)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Melody Dataset**: This dataset consists of pieces of music scores and their corresponding source code in LilyPond, collected from the Internet. It contains 4,208 image-code pairs.

2. **Formula Dataset**: This dataset is collected from Zhixue.com and includes 61,649 printed formulas from high school math exercises, along with their corresponding TEX code.

3. **Multi-Line Dataset**: This is a synthetic dataset containing 4,595 multi-line formulas, which include complex formulas such as piecewise functions.

The authors provide a summary of the statistics for these datasets in Table 1, which confirms their details and reinforces their relevance to the study.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** for any papers or sources that provide the original datasets or describe them in detail. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely original datasets created or compiled by the authors.

Since the datasets are described in detail within the paper, I will create the citations based on the information provided:

- For the **Melody Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yu Yin, Zhenya Huang, Enhong Chen, Qi Liu, Fuzheng Zhang, Xing Xie, and Guoping Hu. *Transcribing Content from Structural Images with Spotlight Mechanism*. In KDD ’18: The 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining, August 19–23, 2018, London, United Kingdom. ACM, New York, NY, USA.

- For the **Formula Dataset**, the citation is the same as above since it is part of the same study.

- For the **Multi-Line Dataset**, the citation is also the same as above.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
