To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Kazakh Offline Handwritten Text Dataset" by Nazgul Toiganbayeva et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets that are introduced or referenced. The abstract mentions the **Kazakh Offline Handwritten Text Dataset (KOHTD)**, which is a significant dataset containing 3000 handwritten exam papers and over 140,335 segmented images. This indicates that KOHTD is the primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the KOHTD dataset. The authors emphasize the lack of available datasets for Kazakh handwriting and describe the dataset's purpose and composition, confirming that KOHTD is indeed the focus of their research.

In the **data collection and storage** section, I will look for specific details about how the KOHTD dataset was created, including the number of samples, types of documents, and any unique characteristics. The paper states that KOHTD consists of exam papers filled by students at Satbayev University and Al-Farabi Kazakh National University, which adds context to the dataset's origin.

I will also check the **experiments** section to see if the authors mention any other datasets used for comparison or validation purposes. However, the primary focus remains on KOHTD, and no additional datasets are explicitly mentioned.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the KOHTD dataset. The authors do not provide a separate citation for KOHTD, but they reference their own work throughout the paper. Therefore, I will use the citation for the paper itself as the authoritative source for KOHTD.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Nazgul Toiganbayeva, Mahmoud Kasem, Galymzhan Abdimanap, Kairat Bostanbekov, Abdelrahman Abdallah, Anel Alimova, Daniyar Nurseitov. *Kazakh Offline Handwritten Text Dataset (KOHTD)*. Preprint submitted to Journal, October 11, 2021.

Now, I will compile the information about the KOHTD dataset into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.
