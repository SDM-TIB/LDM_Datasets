To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GDA: Generative Data Augmentation Techniques for Relation Extraction Tasks" by Xuming Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the experimental results were validated on three datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **Section 4.2**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **SemEval 2010 Task 8**: This dataset is a classical benchmark for relation extraction tasks, consisting of 19 relation types with a total of 9,863 relation mentions across training, validation, and test sets.

2. **TAC Relation Extraction Dataset (TACRED)**: This is a large-scale dataset collected from prior TAC KBP shared tasks, containing 42 relation types and a total of 97,771 relation mentions across training, validation, and test sets.

3. **TACREV**: This dataset is a revisited version of TACRED, which addresses issues found in the original dataset and includes 42 relation types with a total of 97,771 relation mentions, similar to TACRED.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **SemEval 2010 Task 8**, the citation is:
  > Hendrickx, I., Kim, S. N., Kozareva, Z., Nakov, P., O Séaghdha, D., Padó, S., Pennacchiotti, M., Romano, L., & Szpakowicz, S. (2010). SemEval-2010 Task 8: Multi-way classification of semantic relations between pairs of nominals. In Proceedings of SemEval, pages 33–38.

- For **TACRED**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, Y., Zhong, Y., Chen, D., Angeli, G., & Manning, C. D. (2017). Position-aware attention and supervised data improve slot filling. In Proceedings of EMNLP, pages 35–45.

- For **TACREV**, the citation is:
  > Alt, C., Gabryszak, A., & Hennig, L. (2020). Tacred revisited: A thorough evaluation of the tacred relation extraction task. In Proceedings of ACL, pages 1558–1569.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
