To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Delving Deeper into Convolutional Networks for Learning Video Representations" by Nicolas Ballas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their approach on tasks such as **Human Action Recognition** and **Video Captioning**, which suggests that specific datasets will be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the **experimentation section**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **UCF101 Dataset**: This dataset is referenced for human action recognition and is described as containing 13,320 video clips across 101 action classes. The authors note that they report results on the first split of this dataset.

2. **YouTube2Text Dataset**: This dataset is used for video captioning and consists of 1,970 video clips, each with multiple natural language descriptions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **UCF101 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Soomro, Khurram, Zamir, Amir Roshan, and Shah, Mubarak. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.

- For the **YouTube2Text Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chen, David L., and Dolan, William B. *Collecting highly parallel data for paraphrase evaluation*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies-Volume 1, pp. 190â€“200. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2011.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a clear and organized presentation of the datasets used in the research.
