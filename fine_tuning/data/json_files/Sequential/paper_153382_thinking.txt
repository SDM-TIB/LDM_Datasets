To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MIMO-SPEECH: END-TO-END MULTI-CHANNEL MULTI-SPEAKER SPEECH RECOGNITION" by Xuankai Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of the **spatialized wsj1-2mix corpus** for experiments, indicating that this is a dataset of interest. The introduction may provide additional context or mention other datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant mentions in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe the **wsj1-2mix dataset** in detail, including how it was generated and its characteristics. This dataset is crucial for understanding the experiments conducted.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide specific details about the **wsj1-2mix dataset**, including its creation process, the number of hours of data, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) used during the experiments. This information is essential for a comprehensive dataset entry.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **wsj1-2mix dataset**. The paper mentions that the dataset was generated from the **WSJ SI284 corpus**, so I will also look for the citation for this original corpus.

The full citation for the **wsj1-2mix dataset** is as follows:
> The WSJ1-2mix dataset was generated from the WSJ SI284 corpus, which is referenced in:
> Paul G. Allen, et al. *The Wall Street Journal Speech Corpus for Continuous Speech Recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 1993.

The original WSJ SI284 corpus citation is:
> Paul G. Allen, et al. *The Wall Street Journal Speech Corpus for Continuous Speech Recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 1993.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
