To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transferable Neural Projection Representations" by Chinnadhurai Sankar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not detail specific datasets. The introduction may reference prior work or datasets used in related studies, which could be relevant.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Training Setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training their models. Here, they mention that they trained their skip-gram models on the **Wikipedia data XML dump, enwik91**. This is a significant dataset, and I will need to note its details.

In **section 4.2.1 (Similarity Task)**, the authors list several datasets used for evaluating their model's performance on similarity tasks. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **MTurk-287**: This dataset consists of 287 pairs of words and was constructed by crowd-sourcing human similarity ratings using Amazon Mechanical Turk.
2. **WS353**: This dataset contains 353 pairs of similar English words rated by humans and is further split into:
   - **WS353-SIM**: A subset focusing on similarity.
   - **WS353-REL**: A subset capturing different types of similarities and relatedness.
3. **RW-STANFORD**: This dataset includes 2034 rare word pairs sampled from different frequency bins.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MTurk-287**, the citation is:

- For **WS353**, the citation is:

- For **RW-STANFORD**, the citation is:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
