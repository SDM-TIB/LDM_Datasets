To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Seq2seq Translation Model for Sequential Recommendation" by Ke Sun and Tieyun Qian, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract states that the authors conducted extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any specific names or descriptions of the datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of context in sequential recommendation but does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then navigate to the **experiments section (Section 5)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In **Section 5.1 (Datasets)**, they describe two datasets:

1. **MovieLens**: This dataset is widely used for evaluating recommender systems and contains 1,000,209 ratings by 6,040 users on 3,900 movies across 18 categories.

2. **Gowalla**: This dataset is collected from a real-world location-based social network and includes records with occurrence time, GPS location, and user ID. The dataset is supplemented with categories by Yang et al. (2017).

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MovieLens dataset**, the citation is:
  > GroupLens Research. *MovieLens Datasets*. https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/.

- For the **Gowalla dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yang, C., Bai, L., Zhang, C., Yuan, Q., & Han, J. (2017). Bridging collaborative filtering and semi-supervised learning: a neural approach for POI recommendation. In Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (pp. 1245â€“1254). ACM.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
