To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Compositional Generalization in Semantic Parsing" by Inbar Oren et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, while the introduction often highlights the datasets used for experiments. In this case, the introduction mentions that the authors analyze compositional generalization in semantic parsing across five datasets, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets they used. Here, they mention five datasets:

1. **ATIS**: This dataset consists of questions related to flight booking tasks. The authors reference the original work by Price (1990) and Dahl et al. (1994) for this dataset.

2. **GEOQUERY**: This dataset contains questions about U.S. geography, with a citation to Zelle and Mooney (1996).

3. **ADVISING**: This dataset includes questions about academic course information, and the authors cite Finegan-Dollak et al. (2018) for this dataset.

4. **SCHOLAR**: This dataset is focused on questions about academic publications, with a citation to Iyer et al. (2017).

5. **DROP**: This dataset involves questions on history and football games described in text paragraphs, and the authors reference Dua et al. (2019) and Wolfson et al. (2020) for the QDMR programs used in this dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:

- For **ATIS**, the citation is:
  > Price, Patti. "Evaluation of spoken language systems: The atis domain." In Speech and Natural Language: Proceedings of a Workshop Held at Hidden Valley, Pennsylvania, June 24-27, 1990.

- For **GEOQUERY**, the citation is:
  > Zelle, Jennifer, and Raymond Mooney. "Learning to parse database queries using inductive logic programming." In Proceedings of the national conference on artificial intelligence, pages 1050–1055, 1996.

- For **ADVISING**, the citation is:
  > Finegan-Dollak, Catherine, et al. "Improving text-to-sql evaluation methodology." In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 351–360, 2018.

- For **SCHOLAR**, the citation is:
  > Iyer, Srinivasan, et al. "Learning a neural semantic parser from user feedback." In Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2017.

- For **DROP**, the citations are:
  > Dua, Dheeru, et al. "Drop: A reading comprehension benchmark requiring discrete reasoning over paragraphs." In NAACL-HLT, 2019.
  > Wolfson, Tomer, et al. "Break it down: A question understanding benchmark." Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2020.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about each dataset and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
