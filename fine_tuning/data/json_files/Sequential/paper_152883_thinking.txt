To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ASAP: Architecture Search, Anneal and Prune" by Asaf Noy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to gather initial insights about any datasets referenced. The abstract mentions that "experiments on several vision datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method," which indicates that multiple datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors describe their methodology and results. In **Section 4.1**, they specifically mention conducting architecture searches on **CIFAR-10** and **ImageNet**, which are two well-known datasets in the field of computer vision. 

In **Section 4.2**, they provide detailed results for CIFAR-10, stating that their method achieves a mean test error of 1.68%. This section confirms that CIFAR-10 is a primary dataset used for evaluation.

Moving on to **Section 4.3**, the authors discuss transferability tests on additional datasets, including **CINIC-10**, **CIFAR-100**, **Freiburg**, **SVHN**, and **Fashion-MNIST**. Each of these datasets is mentioned in the context of evaluating the performance of the architecture found by their method.

To ensure I have the correct citations for each dataset, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. Here are the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **CIFAR-10**:

2. **ImageNet**:

5. **Freiburg**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
