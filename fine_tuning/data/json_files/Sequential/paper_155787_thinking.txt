To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explainability of Traditional and Deep Learning Models on Longitudinal Healthcare Records" by Lin Lee Cheong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used both **synthetically generated datasets** and a **real-world Medicare claims dataset** for their experiments. This suggests that there are at least two datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **Data Description** section, specifically **section 3**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they describe the creation of **synthetic datasets** and the use of a **real-world medical claims dataset**. 

1. **Synthetic Datasets**: The authors explain that they created synthetic datasets that mimic medical claims datasets. They describe two types of synthetic datasets:
   - **Event-driven dataset**: This dataset consists of 21,000 observations with a binary classification task based on the presence or absence of certain events.
   - **Sequence-driven dataset**: This dataset incorporates temporal dependencies and consists of sequences of events affecting the outcome.

2. **Real-world Medical Claims Dataset**: The authors mention that they used a 5% sample of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicare fee-for-service claims data from 2009 to 2012, which includes about 3 million unique beneficiaries.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the synthetic datasets since they are generated by the authors, but it does provide a citation for the real-world dataset:

- For the **real-world Medicare claims dataset**, the citation is:
  > Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. *Standard analytical files (medicare claims) - lds*. URL https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Files-for-Order/LimitedDataSets/StandardAnalyticalFiles.

Since the synthetic datasets do not have formal citations, I will note them as created by the authors for the purpose of this study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the necessary details and citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will allow for easy access to the datasets mentioned in the paper.
