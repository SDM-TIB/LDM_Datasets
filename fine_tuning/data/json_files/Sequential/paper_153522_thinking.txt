To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SGAS: Sequential Greedy Architecture Search" by Guohao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights that SGAS is applied to various tasks, including image classification and node classification in protein-protein interaction graphs, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**, specifically sections 4.1 and 4.2, where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for their experiments. In section 4.1, they mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for image classification tasks. This dataset is described as containing 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

In section 4.2, the authors discuss their experiments on **ModelNet** for 3D object classification, specifically mentioning **ModelNet10** and **ModelNet40**. They describe ModelNet as a dataset containing objects from 10 and 40 classes, respectively.

Additionally, in section 4.2.3, the authors mention using the **PPI (Protein-Protein Interaction)** dataset for node classification tasks. This dataset is noted for its application in biological graph classification.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

1. For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

2. For **ModelNet**, the citation is:
   > Zhirong Wu, Shuran Song, Aditya Khosla, Fisher Yu, Linguang Zhang, Xiaoou Tang, and Jianxiong Xiao. *3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1912â€“1920, 2015.

3. For **PPI**, the citation is:
   > Marinka Zitnik and Jure Leskovec. *Predicting multicellular function through multi-layer tissue networks*. In Bioinformatics, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a clear understanding of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the experiments conducted.
