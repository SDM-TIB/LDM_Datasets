To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-tied Units for Efficient Gating in LSTM and Highway Networks" by C. Zhang and P. C. Woodland, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses speech recognition experiments using British English multi-genre broadcast data, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention the use of the **MGB3 dataset**, which is derived from multi-genre broadcast media. The section provides details about the dataset, including its size and the nature of the audio data.

In **section 5 (Experimental Results)**, the authors further elaborate on the datasets used in their experiments, confirming the use of the **MGB3 dataset** for both the 55-hour and 275-hour training sets. This reinforces the importance of this dataset in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MGB3 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **MGB3 dataset**, the citation is:
  > P. Bell, M.J.F. Gales, T. Hain, J. Kilgour, P. Lanchantin, X. Liu, A. McParland, S. Renals, O. Saz, M. Wester, & P.C. Woodland. "The MGB challenge: Evaluating multi-genre broadcast media transcription". In Proceedings of the ASRU, Scottsdale, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and ensure that I include the full citation in the final output.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details and citations are included.
