To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RECURRENTGPT: Interactive Generation of (Arbitrarily) Long Text" by Wangchunshu Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions but may not detail specific datasets. The introduction might mention datasets used for experiments or comparisons, so I will pay close attention to that section.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where datasets are typically described. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others. I will look for papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail.

If the paper mentions any datasets but does not provide full citations, I will conduct a brief search to find the appropriate references online, ensuring that I have the correct and complete citation information.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, in a structured format that is easy to understand and use.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry is clear and concise, providing enough detail for someone unfamiliar with the paper to understand the significance of each dataset and how it relates to the research presented in the paper.
