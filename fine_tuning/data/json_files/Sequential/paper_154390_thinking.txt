To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Network-Based Ranging with LTE Channel Impulse Response for Localization in Indoor Environments" by Halim Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it discusses the methodology, it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (Section 3), which typically contains information about the datasets used for validation and testing. In this section, the authors describe the experimental setup, including the use of LTE signals collected in an indoor environment. They mention that the data were collected from two LTE receivers: a rover receiver and a base receiver, but they do not specify a named dataset at this point.

I will also check the **methodology section** (Section 2) for any details on how the data was collected or processed. Here, the authors describe the channel impulse response (CIR) estimation from LTE signals, but again, no specific dataset names are provided.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets, I will look at the **References section** to see if any prior works are cited that may have datasets relevant to this study. The references may include datasets used in previous research that the authors built upon.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite several papers related to LTE signals and indoor localization. However, they do not provide specific dataset citations in the paper itself. This indicates that the data used in this study may be proprietary or collected specifically for this research.

Given that no specific datasets are named, I will summarize the data collection process instead:

1. **Data Collection**: The authors collected LTE signals in an indoor environment over a distance of 109 m using two receivers (rover and base). The data consisted of channel impulse responses (CIR) estimated from the LTE signals.

2. **Data Processing**: The collected data were processed using a software-defined receiver to estimate the CIR, which was then used for training and validation of the proposed RNN-LSTM model.

Since there are no formal dataset citations provided in the paper, I will note that the data is not publicly available and is specific to the experiments conducted by the authors.

In conclusion, I will document the findings regarding the datasets, emphasizing the lack of explicit dataset names or citations while summarizing the data collection and processing methods used in the study.
