To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MASK: A flexible framework to facilitate de-identification of clinical texts" by Nikola Milosevic et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and references sections** to locate any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the importance of de-identifying clinical texts, which suggests that datasets related to clinical narratives may be involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenges of sharing medical information due to privacy concerns, hinting at the need for datasets that can be used for de-identification research. However, I need to find specific dataset names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Results)**, where the authors provide information about the datasets used in their experiments. They specifically mention the **i2b2 2014 dataset**, which contains 790 annotated clinical narratives. This dataset is crucial for their evaluation of the MASK framework.

The authors describe the i2b2 dataset as follows:
- It contains clinical narratives that have been de-identified, with identifiable information replaced with realistic fake information. The dataset includes various categories such as Name, Profession, Location, Age, Date, Contact, and IDs.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the i2b2 dataset. The relevant citation is:
> Stubbs, A., & Uzuner, Ö. (2015). Annotating longitudinal clinical narratives for de-identification: The 2014 i2b2/uthealth corpus. *Journal of Biomedical Informatics*, 58, S20–S29.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information about the i2b2 dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the i2b2 dataset, summarizing its details and including the citation for clarity and completeness.
