To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network for massive MIMO CSI Prediction" by Sharan Mourya et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract discusses the importance of Channel State Information (CSI) prediction in 5G communication systems but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction provides context about the challenges in CSI prediction but again does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **system model** and **results** sections, as these often contain details about the datasets used for experiments. In the **system model** section, the authors describe the MIMO OFDM system and the channel model but do not mention any datasets. 

Moving on to the **results** section, I will look for any references to datasets used for simulations or comparisons. The authors mention using the **3GPP channel model** for their simulations. This is a standard model used in wireless communication research, but it is not a dataset in the traditional sense. Instead, it is a framework for simulating channel conditions.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited there. However, the references primarily consist of papers discussing various methodologies and models related to CSI prediction, rather than specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets for their experiments. Instead, they relied on the 3GPP channel model for their simulations, which is a widely accepted model in the field but does not have a formal citation like a dataset would.

Since there are no specific datasets mentioned in the paper, I will note that the primary resource referenced is the **3GPP channel model**, which is commonly used in the field of wireless communications. However, it is important to clarify that this is not a dataset in the conventional sense.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings as follows:

- **3GPP Channel Model**: This model is used for simulating channel conditions in massive MIMO systems but is not a dataset with a formal citation.

Since no datasets were explicitly mentioned or cited in the paper, I will conclude my extraction process here. If any datasets had been provided, I would have ensured to include their full citations as required.
