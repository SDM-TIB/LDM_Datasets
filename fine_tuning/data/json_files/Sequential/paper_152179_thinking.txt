To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Capacity and Trainability in Recurrent Neural Networks" by Jasmine Collins, Jascha Sohl-Dickstein, and David Sussillo, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on RNN architectures, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe their experimental design. Here, they mention using various tasks to evaluate RNN architectures, including a **perceptron capacity task**, **memory capacity task**, **text8 task**, **parentheses counting task**, and **arithmetic task**. Each of these tasks likely involves specific datasets or data generation methods.

In **section 2.1.2 (Results)**, the authors discuss the **perceptron capacity task**, which involves drawing datasets of binary inputs and target binary labels. They describe how these datasets are generated, but they do not provide a formal dataset citation since they are synthetic datasets.

In **section 2.2 (Memory Capacity)**, they mention using random inputs drawn from a uniform distribution, which again does not correspond to a formal dataset citation.

Moving to **section 3 (Additional Tasks)**, the authors describe the **text8 task**, which uses the text8 dataset from Wikipedia. This is a well-known dataset, and I will need to find its full citation.

The **parentheses counting task** and **arithmetic task** also involve synthetic data generation, so they do not have formal citations either.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the **text8 dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Mahoney, M. (2011). Large text compression benchmark: About the test data. Retrieved from http://mattmahoney.net/dc/textdata.

Now, I will summarize the datasets I have identified:

1. **Perceptron Capacity Task**: Synthetic dataset of binary inputs and labels generated for the task.
2. **Memory Capacity Task**: Synthetic dataset of random inputs drawn from a uniform distribution.
3. **Text8 Task**: Utilizes the text8 dataset from Wikipedia.
   - Citation: Mahoney, M. (2011). Large text compression benchmark: About the test data. Retrieved from http://mattmahoney.net/dc/textdata.
4. **Parentheses Counting Task**: Synthetic dataset generated for the task.
5. **Arithmetic Task**: Synthetic dataset generated for the task.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the text8 dataset while noting that the other tasks involve synthetic datasets without formal citations.
