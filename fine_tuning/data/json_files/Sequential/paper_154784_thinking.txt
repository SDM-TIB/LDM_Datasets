To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The effect of phased recurrent units in the classification of multiple catalogs of astronomical lightcurves" by C. Donoso-Oliva et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used in the study. In this case, the authors mention using **seven catalogs containing periodic and non-periodic astronomical objects**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. They explicitly list the seven datasets used for their experiments:

1. **MACHO Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the MACHO project, which aimed to find dark matter in the Milky Way. The authors reference the catalog from Kim et al. (2011) for their analysis.

2. **ASAS Dataset**: The All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) dataset is mentioned, with a focus on V-band periodic lightcurves selected by Naul et al. (2018).

3. **OGLE Dataset**: The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) dataset is discussed, with a selection made by Becker et al. (2020) for I-band lightcurves.

4. **WISE Dataset**: The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) dataset is referenced, specifically using the W1-band selection from Nikutta et al. (2014).

5. **LINEAR Dataset**: The Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) dataset is mentioned, with details on its composition.

6. **Gaia Dataset**: The Gaia DR2 catalog of variable stars is discussed, with a focus on the G-passband lightcurves.

7. **CSS Dataset**: The Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) dataset is described, which includes photometries derived from seven years of observation.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **MACHO Dataset**:
  > Alcock C., et al. (2000). *The Astrophysical Journal*, 542, 281.

- For the **ASAS Dataset**:
  > Pojmanski G., Maciejewski G. (2005). *Acta Astronomica*, 55, 97.

- For the **OGLE Dataset**:
  > Udalski A., Kubiak M., Szymanski M. (1997). *arXiv preprint astro-ph/9710091*.

- For the **WISE Dataset**:
  > Wright E. L., et al. (2010). *AJ*, 140, 1868.

- For the **LINEAR Dataset**:
  > Stokes G. H., et al. (2000). *Icarus*, 148, 21.

- For the **Gaia Dataset**:
  > Collaboration G., et al. (2016). *arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.04153*.

- For the **CSS Dataset**:
  > Drake A., et al. (2009). *The Astrophysical Journal*, 696, 870.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
