To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Monotonicity in Semantic Parsing" by Francesco Cazzaro et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their approach on two popular semantic parsing datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **GEOALIGNED**: This dataset augments the GEO semantic parsing benchmark with token alignment annotations. It contains 880 examples related to US geography, annotated with token alignments. The authors evaluate their approach on three partitions: question (?), query (Q), and length (LEN). 

2. **SCANSP**: This dataset consists of navigational commands in natural language paired with action sequences. It is based on the SCAN dataset and contains 20,910 commands, with specific splits for training, validation, and testing.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** for these datasets in the **References section** of the paper:

- For **GEOALIGNED**, the citation is:
  > Davide Locatelli and Ariadna Quattoni. *Measuring alignment bias in neural seq2seq semantic parsers*. In Proceedings of the 11th Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics, pages 200–207, Seattle, Washington. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2022.

- For **SCANSP**, the citation is:
  > Jonathan Herzig and Jonathan Berant. *Span-based semantic parsing for compositional generalization*. In Proceedings of the 59th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 11th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing, pages 908–921, Online. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation as required. This will prepare the information for any further processing or review.
