To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural HMMs Are All You Need (for High-Quality Attention-Free TTS)" by Shivam Mehta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but the introduction and experiments sections are likely to contain more detailed references to datasets used in the study.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss advancements in text-to-speech (TTS) technology and mention the use of various models, but they do not explicitly name any datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the **experiments section**.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for training and evaluation. They specifically mention that they trained their systems on the **LJ Speech dataset**, which is a well-known dataset for TTS tasks. The paper states that this dataset contains utterances adapted from free audiobooks read by a female speaker of US English.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the LJ Speech dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- **LJ Speech Dataset**: 
  > Keith Ito. *The LJ Speech Dataset*. 2017. Available at: https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/

This citation is crucial as it provides the necessary details for anyone looking to access the dataset.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **LJ Speech Dataset**: This dataset is used for training the TTS systems described in the paper. It contains normalized text and matching audio from free audiobooks.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset. This will allow for proper attribution and facilitate further research or application of the findings in the paper.
