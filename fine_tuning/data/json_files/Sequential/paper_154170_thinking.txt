To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "A Probabilistic End-To-End Task-Oriented Dialog Model with Latent Belief States towards Semi-Supervised Learning" by Yichi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on three benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Cambridge Restaurant (CamRest676)**: This dataset contains 676 dialogs and is focused on assisting users in finding restaurants. 

2. **Stanford In-Car Assistant (In-Car)**: This dataset consists of 3,031 dialogs and covers tasks such as calendar scheduling, weather information retrieval, and point-of-interest navigation.

3. **MultiWOZ**: This is a large-scale multi-domain dataset with 10,438 dialogs, which includes various domains such as attractions, hotels, hospitals, and restaurants. The authors note that they used the corrected version, MultiWOZ 2.1, due to annotation errors in the original dataset.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CamRest676**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Hsien Wen, Milica Gasic, Nikola Mrkˇsi´c, Pei-Hao Su, David Vandyke, and Steve Young. *A network-based end-to-end trainable task-oriented dialogue system*. In Proceedings of the 15th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Volume 1, Long Papers, pages 438–449, 2017.

- For **In-Car**, the citation is:

- For **MultiWOZ**, the citation is:
  > Paweł Budzianowski, Tsung-Hsien Wen, Bo-Hsiang Tseng, I˜nigo Casanueva, Stefan Ultes, Osman Ramadan, and Milica Gasic. *Multiwoz-a large-scale multi-domain wizard-of-oz dataset for task-oriented dialogue modelling*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 5016–5026, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
