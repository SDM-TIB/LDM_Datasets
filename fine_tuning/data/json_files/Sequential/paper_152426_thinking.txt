To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Part-of-Speech Tagging via Multi-Task Learning and Character-Level Word Representations" by Anastasyev D. G., Gusev I. O., and Indenbom E. M., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments on various datasets, specifically mentioning the **Penn Treebank (PTB)**, **Syntagrus**, and **Gikrya** datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets, including the number of tokens for training, development, and testing. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope and application.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The references section provides the necessary details for proper citation. Here are the datasets I identified:

1. **Penn Treebank (PTB)**: This dataset is widely used for POS tagging and is mentioned as a standard for evaluation in the paper. The citation for the PTB is:
   > Marcus, M. P., Santorini, B., & Marcinkiewicz, M. A. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313-330.

2. **Syntagrus**: This dataset is part of the Universal Dependencies project and is used for Russian language processing. The citation is:
   > Zakharchenko, E., & Sokolova, M. (2017). Syntagrus: A Russian Dependency Treebank. In *Proceedings of the International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING 2018)*.

3. **Gikrya**: This dataset is also used for Russian language processing and is part of the MorphoRuEval evaluation track. The citation is:
   > Sorokin, A., & Kolesnikov, A. (2017). MorphoRuEval-2017: An Evaluation Track for the Automatic Morphological Analysis Methods for Russian. In *Proceedings of the International Conference “Dialog 2017”*.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations for future use or analysis.
