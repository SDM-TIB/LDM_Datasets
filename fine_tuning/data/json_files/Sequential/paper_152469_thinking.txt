To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DNN-driven Speaker Independent Audio-Visual Mask Estimation for Speech Separation" by Mandar Gogate et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used for experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of the **Grid Corpus** as a benchmark for their experiments. This is a clear indication that a dataset is involved, and I will need to gather more details about it.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (AV Dataset and Pre-processing)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They specify that the Grid Corpus consists of recordings from 5 speakers, each reciting around 1000 utterances, and that these utterances are mixed with various background noises from the 3rd CHiME Challenge (CHiME3). This section provides essential information about the dataset's structure and usage.

The authors also mention the **CHiME3 dataset** in conjunction with the Grid Corpus, as it is used for mixing noise with the clean utterances. I will need to ensure I capture both datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **Grid Corpus**, the citation is:
   > M. Cooke, J. Barker, S. Cunningham, and X. Shao. *An audio-visual corpus for speech perception and automatic speech recognition*. The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, vol. 120, no. 5, pp. 2421–2424, 2006.

2. For the **CHiME3 dataset**, the citation is:
   > J. Barker, R. Marxer, E. Vincent, and S. Watanabe. *The third chime speech separation and recognition challenge: Dataset, task and baselines*. In Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding (ASRU), 2015 IEEE Workshop on, pp. 504–511, 2015.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research paper.
