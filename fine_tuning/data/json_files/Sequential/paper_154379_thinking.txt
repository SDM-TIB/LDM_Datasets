To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KST-GCN: A Knowledge-Driven Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Traffic Forecasting" by Jiawei Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the experimental results are based on a real-world dataset, which indicates that there is a specific dataset used for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors describe the data used for their experiments. In this section, they mention that the experiments are based on a dataset from Luohu District, Shenzhen, which includes various types of data such as taxi track data, road network data, weather data, and POI data collected from January 1 to January 31, 2015. This is a clear indication of the dataset being utilized.

I will also look for any specific details about the dataset, such as its structure and the types of information it contains. The authors provide information about the dataset containing 156 road sections and nine types of POIs, as well as weather data categorized into five types. This detailed description will help in accurately documenting the dataset.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is a collection of various data types from a specific location and time period, it may not have a formal citation like a published dataset. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper itself.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: Shenzhen Traffic Dataset
- **Description**: Contains taxi track data, road network data, weather data, and POI data from Luohu District, Shenzhen, covering the period from January 1 to January 31, 2015. It includes 156 road sections and nine types of POIs, with weather data recorded at 15-minute intervals.
- **Citation**: Since this dataset is not formally published, I will reference the paper itself for the dataset details.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation for clarity and future reference.
