To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Land Cover Classification via Multi-temporal Spatial Data by Recurrent Neural Networks" by Dino Ienco et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two different datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Data)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. This section is likely to contain the most pertinent information regarding the datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

In **subsection III.A (THAU dataset)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the first dataset. They mention that it was generated using a time series of Pléiades VHSR images and describe the area covered, the number of objects, and the classes involved. I will note the key details, including the number of objects and the land cover classes.

In **subsection III.B (REUNION ISLAND dataset)**, the authors describe the second dataset, which consists of Landsat 8 images. They provide information about the number of images, the spatial resolution, and the classes represented in the dataset. I will also capture the number of pixels and the classes for this dataset.

After gathering the necessary details from the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

For the **THAU dataset**, I will note that it is based on Pléiades images, but since the paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset, I will mention it as a proprietary dataset from Airbus DS/Spot Image.

For the **REUNION ISLAND dataset**, I will look for the original sources mentioned in the paper, specifically the 2012 Corine Land Cover map and the 2014 farmers’ graphical land parcel registration. I will ensure to provide citations for these sources as well.

Finally, I will compile the dataset descriptions and their citations into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its respective citation for clarity and completeness.
