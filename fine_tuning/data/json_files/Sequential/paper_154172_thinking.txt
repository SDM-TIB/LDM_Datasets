To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distilled One-Shot Federated Learning" by Yanlin Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed method on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved, but it does not specify their names.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors mention the challenges of federated learning and the need for efficient communication, but again, no specific datasets are named.

Moving on to the **experiments section (Section 4)**, I will focus on the subsections that detail the datasets used. In **Section 4.1 (Image Classification)**, the authors present results from experiments on the **Federated MNIST** dataset, which is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit classification. They also mention the **IMDB** dataset for sentiment analysis in **Section 4.2 (Text Classification)**, and the **TREC-6** dataset for question classification. Additionally, the **Sent140** dataset is referenced for sentiment analysis tasks.

In **Section 4.3**, the authors discuss the performance of their method under low participation conditions, but they do not introduce any new datasets here.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Federated MNIST**: This dataset is derived from the original MNIST dataset, which is widely used in machine learning. The citation for the original MNIST dataset is:
   > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

2. **IMDB**: The citation for the IMDB dataset used for sentiment analysis is:
   > Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 142–150, Portland, Oregon, USA, June 2011.

3. **TREC-6**: The citation for the TREC-6 dataset is:
   > Ellen M Voorhees and Donna Harman. *Overview of the sixth text retrieval conference (trec-6)*. Information Processing & Management, 36(1):3–35, 2000.

4. **Sent140**: The citation for the Sent140 dataset is:
   > Alec Go, Richa Bhayani, and Lei Huang. *Twitter sentiment classification using distant supervision*. CS224N project report, Stanford, 1(12):2009, 2009.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Federated MNIST**: A dataset for handwritten digit classification, derived from the original MNIST dataset.
   - Citation: Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

2. **IMDB**: A dataset for sentiment analysis based on movie reviews.
   - Citation: Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 142–150, Portland, Oregon, USA, June 2011.

3. **TREC-6**: A dataset for question classification.
   - Citation: Ellen M Voorhees and Donna Harman. *Overview of the sixth text retrieval conference (trec-6)*. Information Processing & Management, 36(1):3–35, 2000.

4. **Sent140**: A dataset for sentiment analysis based on Twitter data.
   - Citation: Alec Go, Richa Bhayani, and Lei Huang. *Twitter sentiment classification using distant supervision*. CS224N project report, Stanford, 1(12):2009, 2009.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
