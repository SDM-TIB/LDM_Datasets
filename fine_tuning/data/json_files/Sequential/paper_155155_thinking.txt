To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Open surgery tool classification and hand utilization using a multi-camera system" by Kristina Basiev et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's purpose and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any mentions of specific datasets or data collection methods that could indicate the presence of datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of using multi-camera systems in surgical video analysis, which may lead to the identification of relevant datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the **data collection subsection**. Here, the authors describe how data was collected during a simulated open bowel repair procedure. They mention that the dataset includes videos from two camera angles and approximately 200 participants, resulting in about 400 videos. This indicates that a dataset was created for the study, but I need to extract more specific details.

The authors also mention that data from 28 participants (56 videos) were used for detection labeling, and they provide information about the number of frames sampled for training, validation, and testing. This detailed breakdown is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

In the **results section**, I will check for any additional insights or metrics related to the dataset, such as performance evaluations or comparisons with other datasets. This may provide context for how the dataset was utilized in the experiments.

After gathering all relevant information, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to include their citations as well.

Based on the information I have gathered, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Surgical Video Dataset**: This dataset consists of videos collected from a multi-camera setup during a simulated open bowel repair procedure, involving approximately 200 participants and 400 videos in total. The dataset includes various classes of surgical tools and hand positions.

2. **Detection Labeling Dataset**: A subset of the surgical video dataset, specifically 56 videos from 28 participants, was used for detection labeling. This dataset includes 8300 frames for training, 2100 for validation, and 1100 for testing.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets. Since the dataset is original to this study, I will create a citation for it based on the authors and the title of the paper:

- For the **Surgical Video Dataset** and **Detection Labeling Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kristina Basiev, Adam Goldbraikh, Carla M Pugh, and Shlomi Laufer. *Open surgery tool classification and hand utilization using a multi-camera system*. In Proceedings of the [Journal/Conference Name], [Volume], [Pages], [Year].

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets and their citations for further processing or review.
