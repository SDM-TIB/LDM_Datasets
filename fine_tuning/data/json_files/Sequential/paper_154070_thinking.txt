To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Heave and Surge Motions of a Semi-Submersible with Neural Networks" by Xiaoxian Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the training and test data come from a model test conducted in a deep-water ocean basin, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. Here, the authors describe the model test and mention that the data consists of recorded wave elevations and 6-DOF motions of the semi-submersible model. They also state that the data was collected under various wave conditions, which implies multiple datasets.

In **section 2.3 (Model Test)**, the authors provide details about the experimental setup and the data collection process. They mention that they recorded wave elevation and motion data for eight different wave conditions (WC1 to WC8). This section is crucial as it outlines the specifics of the datasets used.

In **section 2.4 (Training and Test Datasets)**, the authors elaborate on how the data was prepared for training and testing. They mention that they had eight 30-minute time series with different incident waves, resulting in approximately 15,000 input-output pairs for training. This section confirms the existence of a structured dataset.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to the wave conditions as WC1 to WC8, but they do not provide specific citations for these datasets within the paper. However, they reference the JONSWAP spectrum for wave calibration, which is a well-known model in ocean engineering.

The citations for the datasets can be summarized as follows:

1. **Model Test Data**: The data used for training and testing comes from a model test conducted in the deep-water ocean basin at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The details of the model test can be referenced as:
   > Guo, X., Zhang, X., Tian, X., Li, X., & Lu, W. (2020). Predicting Heave and Surge Motions of a Semi-Submersible with Neural Networks. *Preprint*.

2. **Wave Conditions**: The wave conditions (WC1 to WC8) are based on the JONSWAP spectrum, which can be cited as:
   > DNV GL. (2010). C205 Environmental Conditions and Environmental Loads. *Recommended Practice*.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified and cited appropriately. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
