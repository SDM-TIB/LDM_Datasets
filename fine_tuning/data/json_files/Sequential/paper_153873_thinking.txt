To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sentiment Analysis Using Simplified Long Short-term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks" by Karthik Gopalakrishnan and Fathi M. Salem, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors perform sentiment analysis on a **GOP Debate Twitter dataset**, which suggests that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will look for more details in the **experiments section**. In section IV, the authors describe the dataset in detail, stating that it comes from **Crowdflower from the “everyone library”** and contains tweets about the GOP debate in Ohio for the 2016 presidential nomination. They mention that the dataset is annotated with sentiment labels: positive, negative, and neutral, but they focus on the positive and negative sentiments for their analysis.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- **Crowdflower GOP Debate Twitter Dataset**: 
  > Crowdflower. “GOP Debate Twitter Dataset.” Available at: https://data.world/crowdflower/first-gop-debate.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the output.
