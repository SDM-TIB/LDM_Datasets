To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dual Encoding U-Net for Spatio-Temporal Domain Shift Frame Prediction" by Jay Santokhi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction may highlight the significance of the datasets used in the study.

In the **Data and Problem Definition section**, the authors describe the dataset used for the traffic frame prediction tasks. They mention that the dataset consists of data from **10 different cities** over the course of **2 years**, categorized into three groups: Core Challenge, Extended Challenge, and Additional Training. This indicates that there are multiple datasets involved.

Next, I will extract the specific datasets mentioned:

1. **Core Challenge Dataset**: This dataset includes traffic data from **Berlin, Chicago, Istanbul, and Melbourne**. It is used for making predictions on traffic states for these cities.

2. **Extended Challenge Dataset**: This dataset consists of traffic data from **New York and Vienna**, which are used for predictions without any training data available for these cities.

3. **Additional Training Dataset**: This dataset includes traffic data from **Antwerp, Bangkok, Barcelona, and Moscow**, which is used for training purposes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but it references the Traffic4Cast competition, which is the source of the data.

The citation for the Traffic4Cast competition is:
> Kreil, D. P., Kopp, M. K., Jonietz, D., Neun, M., Gruca, A., Herruzo, P., Martin, H., Soleymani, A., & Hochreiter, S. (2020). The surprising efficiency of framing geo-spatial time series forecasting as a video prediction task - Insights from the IARAI Traffic4cast Competition at NeurIPS 2019. *Proceedings of Machine Learning Research*, 123, 232â€“241. Available: www.here.com

Since the datasets are derived from the Traffic4Cast competition, I will use this citation for all datasets mentioned.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and associated with the correct citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
