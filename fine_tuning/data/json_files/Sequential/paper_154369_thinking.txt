To extract datasets from the research paper titled "StackMix: A complementary Mix algorithm" by John Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions improvements on various benchmarks, specifically citing **ImageNet**, **Tiny ImageNet**, **CIFAR-100**, **CIFAR-10**, and **STL-10**. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **Results** section. In this paper, the datasets are discussed throughout the results, particularly in the context of the experiments conducted. I will note down each dataset mentioned along with the context in which they are used.

From the **Results** section, I identify the following datasets:

1. **ImageNet**: The paper describes it as a dataset with 1.3 million training images and 50,000 validation images across 1,000 classes. This dataset is used with the ResNet-50 architecture.

2. **Tiny ImageNet**: This dataset consists of 110,000 images of size 64 × 64 × 3 and 200 classes, with a train/test split of 100,000/10,000. It is used with the ResNet-56 architecture.

3. **CIFAR-100**: This dataset has 100 classes and 500 samples per class in the training set, and 100 samples per class in the test set. The images are of size 32 × 32 × 3, and it is used with VGG16 and PreActResNet-18 architectures.

4. **CIFAR-10**: This is the 10-class version of CIFAR-100, with similar training and testing setups. It is used with ResNet20 and SeResNet-18 architectures.

5. **STL-10**: This dataset comprises 1300 images of size 96 × 96 × 3 with a 500/800 train/test split and 10 classes. It is used with the Wide ResNet 16-8 architecture.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets directly, but I can infer the following based on common knowledge and the context provided in the paper:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, Alexander C. Berg, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015.

- For **Tiny ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Tiny ImageNet. *Stanford CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition*. Available at: http://cs231n.stanford.edu/tiny-imagenet-200.zip.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **STL-10**, the citation is:
  > Adam Coates, Andrew Y. Ng, and Honglak Lee. *An Analysis of Single-Layer Networks in Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS), 2011.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary information for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
