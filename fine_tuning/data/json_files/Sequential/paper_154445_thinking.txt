To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EmotionGIF-IITP-AINLPML: Ensemble-based Automated Deep Neural System for predicting category(ies) of a GIF response" by Soumitra Ghosh et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the task and hints at the use of a dataset related to GIF responses, but I need to find specific details.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Datasets)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. In this section, they mention the **EmotionGIF 2020 dataset**, which consists of 40,000 two-turn Twitter threads. The dataset is divided into a training set of 32,000 samples and development and evaluation sets of 4,000 samples each. This section provides crucial information about the dataset's structure and content.

I will also note the details about the dataset's contents, such as the inclusion of original tweets, replies, and GIF responses, as well as the category labels associated with the GIFs. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's purpose and application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the EmotionGIF 2020 dataset. The citation is provided as follows:
> Boaz Shmueli and Lun-Wei Ku. 2020. Socialnlp emotiongif 2020 challenge overview: Predicting reaction gif categories on social media. Technical report.

This citation will be important for proper attribution when documenting the dataset.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, including its description and citation, into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details about the dataset used in the research paper.
