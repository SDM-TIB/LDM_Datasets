To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating News Headlines with Recurrent Neural Networks" by Konstantin Lopyrev, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the application of a recurrent neural network for generating headlines, which suggests that a dataset is likely involved. 

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the author provides a detailed overview of the dataset used for training the model. The paper specifies that the model is trained using the **English Gigaword dataset**. This section describes the dataset's composition, including the number of articles and the preprocessing steps taken.

In **section 3.1 (Overview)**, the author states that the English Gigaword dataset consists of several years of news articles from six major news agencies, including the New York Times and the Associated Press. The training data comprises 5.5 million news articles with 236 million words, which is significant information for the dataset entry.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the English Gigaword dataset. However, the dataset itself is not typically cited in the same way as academic papers. Instead, I will provide a general reference to the dataset's source, which is the Stanford Linguistics department.

The citation for the English Gigaword dataset is:
> Graff, P., & Cieri, C. (2003). *English Gigaword*. Linguistic Data Consortium.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the English Gigaword dataset, ensuring that it is ready for review or further processing.
