To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ShortFuse: Learning Time Series Representations with Structured Information" by Madalina Fiterau et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental design sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on two biomedical applications, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the integration of time series data with structured information, particularly in the context of healthcare applications. They mention using data from patients with cerebral palsy and osteoarthritis, which hints at specific datasets being utilized.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental design section** where the authors describe their evaluation framework. They mention two specific biomedical applications:

1. **Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI)**: This dataset consists of 1926 patients and includes longitudinal observational data on knee osteoarthritis, including medical histories, accelerometer-based physical activity data, and X-ray data. The authors use this dataset to predict the progression of osteoarthritis.

2. **Cerebral Palsy Data**: The authors refer to a dataset used to predict surgical outcomes for patients with cerebral palsy. They mention using gait data and clinical information, but they do not provide a specific name for this dataset.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI)**, the citation is:
  > Osteoarthritis Initiative. Osteoarthritis initiative, a knee health study, 2017. URL: https://oai.epi-ucsf.org/datarelease/.

- For the **cerebral palsy dataset**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation, it references a study by Schwartz et al. (2013) that uses similar data. The citation for that study is:
  > Schwartz, M. H., Rozumalski, A., Truong, W., & Novacheck, T. F. (2013). Predicting the outcome of intramuscular psoas lengthening in children with cerebral palsy using preoperative gait data and the random forest algorithm. *Gait & Posture*, 37(4), 473-479.

With this information, I can summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI)**: A longitudinal observational study dataset that includes various patient data related to knee osteoarthritis.
2. **Cerebral Palsy Dataset**: Data used for predicting surgical outcomes in patients with cerebral palsy, referenced in the context of a study by Schwartz et al.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
