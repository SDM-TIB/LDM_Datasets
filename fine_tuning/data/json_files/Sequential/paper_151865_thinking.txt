To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Simple Neural Attentive Meta-Learner" by Nikhil Mishra et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on several heavily-benchmarked tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of meta-learning and mention that they evaluate their method on specific datasets. I will look for explicit mentions of dataset names or descriptions.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors detail their evaluation methodology and the datasets used. They specifically mention two datasets for few-shot image classification:

1. **Omniglot Dataset**: This dataset consists of black-and-white images of handwritten characters from 50 different languages, totaling 1,632 different classes with 20 instances per class. The authors downsampled the images to 28x28 pixels and selected 1,200 classes for training and 432 for testing.

2. **mini-ImageNet Dataset**: This is a subset of the well-known ImageNet dataset, consisting of 84x84 color images from 100 different classes with 600 instances per class. The authors used a specific split for training, validation, and testing, which is commonly referenced in meta-learning literature.

To confirm the datasets used, I will check the **references section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Omniglot Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lake, B. M., Salakhutdinov, R., Gross, J., & Tenenbaum, J. B. (2011). One-shot learning of simple visual concepts. *Cognitive Science*, 35(2), 202-210.

- For the **mini-ImageNet Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T., Wierstra, D., et al. (2016). Matching networks for one-shot learning. In *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems* (NIPS), 29, 3630-3638.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
