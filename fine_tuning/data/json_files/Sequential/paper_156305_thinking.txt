To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling Multi-aspect Preferences and Intents for Multi-behavioral Sequential Recommendation" by Haobing Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "real-world datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), as this is typically where datasets are described in detail. In this section, the authors mention using two datasets: **Taobao** and **Retailrocket**. I will take note of the context in which these datasets are used, including any relevant statistics or characteristics that are provided.

In the **experiments subsection 5.1.1 (Datasets and Preprocessing)**, the authors provide specific details about the datasets:

1. **Taobao**: This dataset contains 10,000 users, 1,407,580 items, and 11,550,581 interactions, including various behavior types such as clicks, collects, carts, and buys.

2. **Retailrocket**: This dataset includes 417,053 users, 1,086 items, and 242,556 collects, 343,564 carts, and 69,332 buys.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper provides links to the datasets, which I will use to construct the citations:

- For **Taobao**, the citation is:
  > Taobao Dataset. Available at: https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/dataDetail?dataId=46.

- For **Retailrocket**, the citation is:
  > Retailrocket Dataset. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/retailrocket/ecommerce-dataset.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and completeness.

In summary, I have extracted the following datasets from the paper:

1. **Taobao**: 
   - Description: Contains 10,000 users, 1,407,580 items, and 11,550,581 interactions.
   - Citation: Taobao Dataset. Available at: https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/dataDetail?dataId=46.

2. **Retailrocket**: 
   - Description: Includes 417,053 users, 1,086 items, and various interactions.
   - Citation: Retailrocket Dataset. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/retailrocket/ecommerce-dataset.

With this information, I am ready to present the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
