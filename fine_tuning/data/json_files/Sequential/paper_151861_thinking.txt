To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepProbe: Information Directed Sequence Understanding and Chatbot Design via Recurrent Neural Networks" by Zi Yin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and applications sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of DeepProbe and its applications, which suggests that there may be datasets used for training or evaluation purposes.

Next, I will focus on the **applications section** (specifically section 4), where the authors describe three applications of DeepProbe: query rewriting, relevance scoring, and chatbot design. Each application likely involves specific datasets for training and evaluation.

In **section 4.1 (Ingress: Query Rewriting)**, the authors mention that they collected a dataset consisting of **12 million clicked (question-form query, standard query) pairs** for training the query rewriting model. This dataset is crucial for understanding how the model learns to rewrite user queries into standard forms.

In **section 4.2 (Egress: Relevance Scoring)**, the authors describe the training dataset used for the scoring model, which consists of **15 million clicks sampled from a month-long click log**, resulting in **6.4 million distinct user queries and 5.1 million distinct ads**. This dataset is essential for evaluating the relevance scoring capabilities of DeepProbe.

In **section 4.3 (Chatbot: Information Directed Conversation and Recommendation)**, the authors do not explicitly mention a new dataset but refer to the datasets used in the previous sections for training the chatbot's functionalities.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are derived from internal data or commercial systems. Therefore, I will summarize the datasets based on the information provided in the text.

The datasets I will extract are:

1. **Query Rewriting Dataset**: 
   - Description: A dataset consisting of 12 million clicked (question-form query, standard query) pairs used for training the query rewriting model.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided in the paper.

2. **Relevance Scoring Dataset**: 
   - Description: A dataset consisting of 15 million clicks sampled from a month-long click log, resulting in 6.4 million distinct user queries and 5.1 million distinct ads.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. It's important to note that while the datasets are significant, the paper does not provide formal citations for them, as they are based on proprietary data sources.
