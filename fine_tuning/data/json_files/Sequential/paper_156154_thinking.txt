To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Relevant Entity Selection: Knowledge Graph Bootstrapping via Zero-Shot Analogical Pruning" by Lucas Jarnac, Miguel Couceiro, and Pierre Monnin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their approach on two manually labeled datasets, which suggests that these datasets are crucial to their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** within the paper, which is often where authors describe the datasets they used. In this case, I find that **section 4.1 (Datasets)** provides detailed information about the datasets.

The paper describes two datasets:

1. **Dataset 1**: This dataset consists of 455 seed entities from the Computer Science / Information Technology domain. It includes entities related to telecommunications, networks, and programming languages. The paper mentions that the dataset has undergone filtering to retain only entities with embeddings.

2. **Dataset 2**: This dataset contains 105 seed entities from more heterogeneous domains, including food, music, sport, and science. Similar to Dataset 1, it has also been filtered to ensure that all seed and reached entities have an embedding vector.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are created by the authors and not sourced from other publications, I will note that the datasets are publicly available as indicated in the paper.

The datasets can be cited as follows:

- For **Dataset 1**:
  > Jarnac, L., Couceiro, M., & Monnin, P. (2023). Dataset 1: Seed entities from the Computer Science / Information Technology domain. Available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8091584

- For **Dataset 2**:
  > Jarnac, L., Couceiro, M., & Monnin, P. (2023). Dataset 2: Seed entities from heterogeneous domains. Available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8091584

Finally, I will compile the information about the datasets, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for further use or analysis.
