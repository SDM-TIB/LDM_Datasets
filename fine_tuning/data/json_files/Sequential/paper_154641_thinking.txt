To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Inflation with Neural Networks" by Livia Paranhos, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of neural networks to forecast inflation but does not specify any datasets. However, the introduction mentions the use of macroeconomic data, which suggests that datasets may be referenced later.

Next, I will focus on the **data section** (Section 3) where the author describes the datasets used for the empirical analysis. Here, the author states that the data is collected from the **FRED-MD database**, which is a compilation of monthly US data. The paper mentions that this dataset consists of **128 series with 730 observations each**, spanning from January 1959 to October 2019. This is a significant dataset for the analysis.

In the same section, the author also describes the creation of two sets of variables: one containing **CPI information** (denoted as wt) and another containing **other economic predictors** (denoted as zt). This indicates that the author is using a specific subset of the FRED-MD data for their analysis.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the FRED-MD dataset in the references section. The relevant citation is:

- **FRED-MD dataset**: 
  > McCracken, M. W., and Ng, S. (2016). "FRED-MD: A monthly database for Macroeconomic Research." *Journal of Business & Economic Statistics*, 34(4), 574â€“589.

Additionally, I will note that the paper mentions the use of **10 series with direct CPI information** and **other economic variables**. However, the specific names of these series are not provided in the text, but they are indexed in Table 2 of the appendix.

To summarize, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the FRED-MD dataset, which is crucial for the analysis presented in the research. I will ensure to document this dataset with its full citation for clarity and reference.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing or review.
