To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Forecasting Future and Past Trends in Time Series" by Cecília Coelho, M. Fernanda P. Costa, and Luís L. Ferrás, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experimental sections typically detail the datasets used for validation and testing.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that are critical for the experiments. The authors may mention specific datasets or provide context about the types of data they are working with.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. I will look for sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets," "Data Collection," or "Experimental Setup." Here, the authors may provide information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, features, and any preprocessing steps taken.

As I identify datasets, I will take note of their names and any relevant details provided in the text. For example, if the authors mention a dataset used for missing data imputation or time series forecasting, I will document its characteristics.

After gathering information about the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for citations that correspond to the datasets mentioned in the text, ensuring that I capture the correct authors, titles, publication venues, and years.

For example, if the paper mentions the "Daily Climate time-series Data" dataset, I will locate the citation in the references that provides the necessary details about this dataset.

Once I have compiled the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, I will organize this information clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its respective citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the extracted information is ready for presentation or further processing, maintaining clarity and accuracy throughout the documentation process.
