To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A bio-inspired bistable recurrent cell allows for long-lasting memory" by Nicolas Vecoven et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for testing their proposed methods. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the following sections:

1. **Section 5 (Analysis of BRC and nBRC performance)**: This section discusses the performance of the proposed models on various benchmarks. I will look for any datasets referenced here, particularly in the context of the three problems tackled: the copy first input benchmark, the denoising benchmark, and the sequential MNIST benchmark.

2. **Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3**: These tables summarize the results of the experiments and may include information about the datasets used, such as their names or characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions the **MNIST dataset**, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation for the MNIST dataset is typically:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

If the paper refers to other datasets, such as a specific benchmark dataset for time-series analysis, I will ensure to find and note their full citations as well.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including names, descriptions, and citations, into a structured format for easy reference and use in future research or applications. This will ensure that all relevant datasets are documented accurately and comprehensively.
