To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data-assisted combustion simulations with dynamic submodel assignment using random forests" by Wai Tong Chung et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a data-assisted approach for combustion simulations, which suggests that there may be datasets involved. I will look for any specific datasets or sources of data mentioned.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** section, particularly the parts that describe how data is generated or utilized. In this case, the authors mention using "instantaneous flow-field solutions from the FRC simulation of the GOX/GCH4 rocket combustor" as the learning dataset. This indicates that the FRC simulation data is a key dataset for their study.

I will also check the **results** section to see if any additional datasets are referenced or if there are any comparisons made with other datasets. The authors discuss various assessments and comparisons, but they primarily focus on the FRC simulation data.

After identifying the datasets, I will look at the **references** section to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references several sources, including:

1. **GRI-Mech 3.0**: This is a widely used chemical mechanism for combustion simulations. The citation is:
   > Smith, G. P., Golden, D. M., Frenklach, M., Moriarty, N. W., et al. (2000). GRI-Mech 3.0. Retrieved from http://www.me.berkeley.edu/gri-mech/

2. **Cantera**: This is a software toolkit for chemical kinetics and thermodynamics used in the simulations. The citation is:
   > Goodwin, D. G., Speth, R. L., Moffat, H. K., & Weber, B. W. (2018). Cantera: An object-oriented software toolkit for chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, and transport processes. Retrieved from https://www.cantera.org

3. **Experimental data by Perakis and Haidn**: The authors reference experimental measurements for validation. The citation is:
   > Perakis, N., & Haidn, O. J. (2019). Inverse heat transfer method applied to capacitively cooled rocket thrust chambers. International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 150, 150-166.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
