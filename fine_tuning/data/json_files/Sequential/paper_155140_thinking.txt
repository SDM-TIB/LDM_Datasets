To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Flood forecasting with machine learning models in an operational framework" by Sella Nevo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions that the flood forecasting system uses machine learning models and has been operational since 2018, which suggests that historical data is likely involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods** and **results** sections. I will pay particular attention to any sections that discuss data management, model training, and validation, as these are likely to contain references to the datasets used.

In the **data management** section, the authors describe the types of data they ingest for their flood forecasting system. They mention:

1. **Stream gauge measurements**: These are obtained from national water authorities and are crucial for real-time flood forecasting.
2. **Satellite-derived precipitation data**: Specifically, they use the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) data, which is important for precipitation forecasting.

I will also check the **model evaluation** sections to see if any datasets are used for validation purposes. The authors mention using historical flood extent data derived from **Sentinel-1 SAR GRD data**, which is publicly available and used to create inundation maps.

Next, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract include:

- For the **IMERG precipitation data**:
  > Huffman, G., Bolvin, D., Braithwaite, D., Hsu, K., Joyce, R., and Xie, P. (2014). Integrated multi-satellite retrievals for GPM (IMERG), version 4.4. NASAâ€™s Precipitation Processing Center.

- For the **Sentinel-1 SAR GRD data**:
  > Schumann, G.J.P., and Moller, D.K. (2015). Microwave remote sensing of flood inundation. Physics and Chemistry of the Earth, Parts A/B/C, 83, pp. 84-95.

- For the **historical flood extent data**:
  > Torres, R., Snoeij, P., Geudtner, D., et al. (2012). GMES Sentinel-1 mission. Remote Sensing of Environment, 120, pp. 9-24.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further research and validation by others in the field.
