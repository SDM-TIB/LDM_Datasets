To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Cognitive Maps from Transformer Representations for Efficient Planning in Partially Observed Environments" by Antoine Dedieu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets that are foundational to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly sections that detail the methodology and results. Here, the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and testing their models. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data (e.g., images, text), and the context in which they were used.

In this paper, I notice that the authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **GINC Dataset**: This dataset is used to study in-context learning (ICL) and is generated from a uniform mixture of five factorial hidden Markov models (HMMs). The training set consists of 1000 documents with approximately 10 million tokens.

2. **2D Aliased Rooms**: The authors describe a series of experiments conducted in 2D aliased rooms, which are defined by specific observations and spatial configurations.

3. **3D Simulated Environments**: The paper also discusses experiments conducted in visually rich 3D environments, which are likely datasets generated for the purpose of evaluating the proposed methods.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow readers to locate the datasets themselves.

For the **GINC Dataset**, the citation is:
> Xie, M., Raghunathan, A., Liang, P., & Ma, T. (2021). An explanation of in-context learning as implicit Bayesian inference. arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.02080.

For the **2D Aliased Rooms** and **3D Simulated Environments**, since these appear to be experimental setups created by the authors, I will note that they may not have formal citations but are described in detail within the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation where applicable. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant information about the datasets used in the research paper.
