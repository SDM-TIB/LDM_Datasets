To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Text Data Augmentation Made Simple By Leveraging NLP Cloud APIs" by Claude Coulombe, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the challenge of having insufficient text data for training deep neural networks, which suggests that datasets are likely discussed in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (4.3)**, where the author explicitly states the dataset used for the experiments. Here, I find that the paper utilizes the **IMDB movie reviews dataset**, specifically the "polarity dataset v2.0," which consists of 1000 positive and 1000 negative reviews. This is a clear identification of a dataset relevant to the research.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the IMDB dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Pang, B., & Lee, L. (2004). A sentimental education: Sentiment analysis using subjectivity summarization based on minimum cuts. In Proceedings of the 42nd annual meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics (p. 271). Association for Computational Linguistics. Online: https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0409058.pdf

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis, containing 1000 positive and 1000 negative reviews.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset.
