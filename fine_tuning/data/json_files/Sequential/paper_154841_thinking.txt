To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TENT: Tensorized Encoder Transformer for temperature forecasting" by Onur Bilgin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two real-life weather datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **USA-Canada Dataset**: This dataset includes hourly measurements of weather attributes for 30 cities in the USA and Canada from October 2012 to November 2017. It contains various weather attributes such as humidity, air pressure, temperature, and wind speed.

2. **Europe Dataset**: This dataset consists of daily measurements of weather attributes for 18 cities across Europe from May 2005 to April 2020. Similar to the USA-Canada dataset, it includes various weather attributes.

To ensure I have the correct details, I will also check the **References section** for full citations related to these datasets. However, it appears that the datasets themselves may not have dedicated citations in the references, as they are likely based on publicly available weather data sources.

For the **USA-Canada Dataset**, I will note that it is based on historical weather data from various weather stations, but the paper does not provide a specific citation. I will summarize the dataset details as follows:

- **USA-Canada Dataset**: Hourly measurements of weather attributes for 30 cities in the USA and Canada from October 2012 to November 2017.

For the **Europe Dataset**, similarly, it is based on historical weather data for 18 cities in Europe, but again, no specific citation is provided. I will summarize this dataset as follows:

- **Europe Dataset**: Daily measurements of weather attributes for 18 cities across Europe from May 2005 to April 2020.

Since the paper does not provide specific citations for these datasets, I will note that they are derived from publicly available weather data sources, which may not have formal citations in the academic sense.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include all relevant details, such as the dataset names, descriptions, and any available information about their sources, while acknowledging the lack of formal citations.

This structured approach will help me accurately extract and summarize the datasets mentioned in the paper.
