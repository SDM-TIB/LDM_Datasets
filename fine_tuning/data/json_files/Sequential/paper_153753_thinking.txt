To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A multivariate water quality parameter prediction model using recurrent neural network" by Dhruti Dheda and Ling Cheng, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the research involves historical water quality data, which suggests that a dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Multivariate Water Quality Parameter Prediction Scheme)**, where the authors describe the data source. They mention that the historical water quality data for the Burnett River was obtained from the **Ambient Estuarine Water Quality Monitoring Programme** provided by the Queensland Government. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used.

I will note the specifics of the dataset:
- **Dataset Name**: Ambient Estuarine Water Quality Monitoring Programme
- **Description**: This dataset includes historical water quality parameters for the Burnett River, covering the years from 2013 to 2019, with observations taken every 30 minutes. The parameters include water temperature, pH value, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for this dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:
> The State of Queensland, “Ambient estuarine water quality monitoring data (includes near real-time sites) - 2012 to present day,” Environment and Science, 2 January 2020. [Online]. Available: https://www.data.qld.gov.au/dataset/ambient-estuarine-water-quality-monitoring-data-near-real-time-sites-2012-to-present-day. [Accessed 15 December 2019].

With this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as it is crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for output, ensuring that it is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
