To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Sequential Neural Encoder with Latent Structured Description for Modeling Sentences" by Yu-Ping Ruan, Qian Chen, and Zhen-Hua Ling, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed model on two tasks: natural language inference (NLI) and sentiment analysis (SA), which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors explicitly state that they used the **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset** for the NLI task and the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)** for the sentiment analysis task. This is a clear indication of the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will gather details about each dataset:

1. **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as containing 570K human-written English sentence pairs that are annotated for entailment, contradiction, or neutral relationships. This dataset is crucial for evaluating models on the NLI task.

2. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**: This dataset includes fine-grained sentiment labels for 215,154 phrases in the parse trees of 11,855 sentences. The authors specify that they focus on sentence-level samples for their experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **SNLI dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. S. Bowman, G. Angeli, C. Potts, and D. C. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 632–642, 2015.

- For the **SST dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Socher, A. Perelygin, J. Wu, J. Chuang, D. C. Manning, A. Ng, and C. Potts. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1631–1642, 2013.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets and their citations clearly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
