To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Layer Normalization for Adaptive Neural Acoustic Modeling in Speech Recognition" by Taesup Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on two benchmark datasets for large vocabulary automatic speech recognition (ASR): **WSJ** and **TED-LIUM release 2**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide specific details about the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **Wall Street Journal (WSJ) Corpus**: This dataset is primarily composed of read speech with texts drawn from a machine-readable corpus of Wall Street Journal news text. The statistics provided include the number of utterances and speakers, which are essential for understanding the dataset's scope.

2. **TED-LIUM Release 2**: This dataset consists of segments of public talks extracted from the TED website. Similar to WSJ, the authors provide statistics about the number of utterances and speakers, which helps in evaluating the dataset's size and diversity.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Wall Street Journal (WSJ) Corpus**, the citation is:
  > D. B. Paul and J. M. Baker. "The design for the wall street journal-based csr corpus." In Proceedings of the workshop on Speech and Natural Language. Association for Computational Linguistics, 1992, pp. 357–362.

- For the **TED-LIUM Release 2**, the citation is:
  > A. Rousseau, P. Delégilse, and Y. Estève. "Enhancing the ted-lium corpus with selected data for language modeling and more ted talks." In LREC, 2014, pp. 3935–3939.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
