To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Methodology for Prediction of Visual Inference Performance on IoT Devices" by Delia Velasco-Montero et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can give clues about the types of data used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors describe the performance evaluation of their methodology. This section is likely to contain specific references to datasets used for training or testing the models.

In Section 6.1, the authors mention that they evaluated their methodology on **seven popular CNNs**, including AlexNet, All-CNN-C, MobileNet, ResNet-18, SimpleNet, SqueezeNet, and Tiny YOLO. They also state that these networks were trained on the **ImageNet dataset** for classification tasks, and All-CNN-C and SimpleNet were trained on **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets, respectively. Additionally, Tiny YOLO was trained on the **COCO dataset** for object detection.

Now, I will compile the datasets identified:

1. **ImageNet Dataset**: This dataset is widely used for image classification tasks and is referenced in the context of training several CNN models.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset is used for training the All-CNN-C model.

3. **CIFAR-100 Dataset**: This dataset is used for training the SimpleNet model.
   - Citation:
     > A. Krizhevsky, V. Nair, and G. Hinton. "The CIFAR Dataset." [Online]. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

4. **COCO Dataset**: This dataset is used for training the Tiny YOLO model for object detection.
   - Citation:

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations. This will allow me to create a structured output that can be used for further analysis or integration into a larger dataset repository.
