To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Measuring Alignment Bias in Neural Seq2Seq Semantic Parsers" by Davide Locatelli and Ariadna Quattoni, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a new dataset called **GEO-ALIGNED**, which augments the existing GEO semantic parsing dataset with alignment annotations. This is a clear indication that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (The GEO-ALIGNED Benchmark)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the GEO-ALIGNED dataset. They mention that this dataset is an augmentation of the original **GEO semantic parsing benchmark** introduced by Zelle and Mooney in 1996. The GEO-ALIGNED dataset includes English, German, and Italian versions, which are crucial details to note.

In this section, I will summarize the key points about the GEO-ALIGNED dataset:
- It contains natural language (NL) and meaning representation (MR) pairs, along with alignment annotations.
- The dataset is designed to evaluate the performance of semantic parsers on varying alignment complexities.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for both the GEO-ALIGNED dataset and the original GEO dataset. The citations I need to extract are:

1. For the **GEO dataset**:
   > John M. Zelle and Raymond J. Mooney. *Learning to parse database queries using inductive logic programming*. In Proceedings of the Thirteenth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence - Volume 2, AAAI’96, page 1050–1055, AAAI Press, 1996.

2. For the **GEO-ALIGNED dataset**, since it is a new dataset created by augmenting the GEO dataset, I will cite it as follows:
   > Davide Locatelli and Ariadna Quattoni. *Measuring Alignment Bias in Neural Seq2Seq Semantic Parsers*. Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain, 2023. (This citation is based on the authors and the title of the paper itself, as the GEO-ALIGNED dataset is introduced in this paper.)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both datasets. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets mentioned in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
