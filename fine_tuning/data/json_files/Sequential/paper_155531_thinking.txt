To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ML-Based Approach for NFL Defensive Pass Interference Prediction Using GPS Tracking Data" by Arian Skoki et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors used player tracking GPS data collected by NFLâ€™s Next Gen Stats throughout the 2018 regular season. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more specific details.

Next, I will look into the **Materials and Methods** section, particularly the **Data Acquisition** subsection. Here, the authors explicitly state that the data was acquired from the "NFL Big Data Bowl 2021," which is hosted on Kaggle. This is a crucial piece of information as it identifies the source of the dataset.

In the **Data Acquisition** subsection, the authors describe the dataset as containing player tracking, play, game, and player-level information for all possible passing plays during the 2018 regular season. They also mention that the dataset is highly imbalanced, with only 259 actions resulting in a DPI event. This provides context about the dataset's structure and its relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The relevant citation for the dataset is:

- For the **NFL Big Data Bowl 2021** dataset, the citation is:
  > NFL. "NFL Big Data Bowl 2021." Kaggle. Available: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/.

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset in a traditional format, I will use the information available to create a suitable citation.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation. The dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **NFL Big Data Bowl 2021 Dataset**: This dataset contains player tracking, play, game, and player-level information for all possible passing plays during the 2018 NFL regular season, which includes data relevant for predicting defensive pass interference.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
