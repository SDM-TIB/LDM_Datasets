To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Analysing Dropout and Compounding Errors in Neural Language Models" by James Oâ€™Neill and Danushka Bollegala, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors report results on two language modeling datasets, which suggests that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, in the **introduction**, the authors mention that experiments are carried out on **Penn Treebank** and **WikiText-2** datasets. This is a clear indication that these datasets are central to their research.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of these datasets in the **methodology** or **results sections** to gather more details about them. In this case, the authors describe the datasets in the context of their experiments, noting that Penn Treebank reduces the long-tail distribution through preprocessing, while WikiText-2 preserves rare words in the training and test set.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and understanding the datasets' origins.

For the **Penn Treebank**, the citation is:
> Marcus, M. P., Santorini, B., & Marcinkiewicz, M. A. (1993). *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2), 313-330.

For the **WikiText-2**, the citation is:
> Merity, S., Keskar, N. S., & Socher, R. (2016). *Pointer sentinel mixture models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.07843.

Having gathered this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for both datasets as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
