To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking Pre-training and Self-training" by Barret Zoph et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of **COCO** and **PASCAL** datasets, which indicates that these are likely the primary datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In the **Methodology section**, the authors describe the datasets in detail. They mention:

1. **COCO Dataset**: This dataset is used for supervised learning in object detection and contains 118,000 images. It is a well-known dataset in the computer vision community.

2. **PASCAL VOC 2012 Dataset**: This dataset is used for semantic segmentation and contains 1,500 images in the training set. The authors also refer to an augmented version of this dataset, which includes additional images for training.

Additionally, the authors mention using **Open Images Dataset** as a source of unlabeled data for self-training, which is another important dataset to note.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **COCO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr DollÃ¡r, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

- For the **PASCAL VOC 2012 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 2010.

- For the **Open Images Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alina Kuznetsova, Hassan Rom, Neil Alldrin, Jasper Uijlings, Ivan Krasin, Jordi Pont-Tuset, Shahab Kamali, Stefan Popov, Matteo Malloci, Alexander Kolesnikov, Tom Duerig, and Vittorio Ferrari. *The Open Images Dataset V4: Unified Image Classification, Object Detection, and Visual Relationship Detection at Scale*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
