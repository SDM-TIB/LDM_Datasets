To extract datasets from the thesis titled "Convolutional Attention-based Seq2Seq Neural Network for End-to-End ASR" by Dan Lim, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on the **‘TIMIT’ speech recognition benchmark dataset**, indicating that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiment)**, particularly **subsection 4.2 (Data description)**, where the author provides detailed information about the dataset used for evaluation. Here, the author confirms that the model was evaluated on the **‘TIMIT’ dataset**, which consists of recorded speech and orthographic transcription. The author also describes the data split procedure and the specific subsets used for training and evaluation.

Now, I will look at the **Bibliography section** to find the full citation for the **‘TIMIT’ dataset**. The thesis does not provide a direct citation for the dataset itself, but it references a related work that discusses the dataset. I will need to ensure that I provide the correct citation for the **‘TIMIT’ dataset** based on established references.

The full citation for the **‘TIMIT’ dataset** is:
> J. S. Garofolo, L. F. Lamel, W. M. Fisher, J. G. Fiscus, and D. S. Pallett. *TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus*. Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia, 1993.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and the citation in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation for clarity and completeness.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset entry for the **‘TIMIT’ dataset** with the necessary details and citation, ready for further processing or review.
