To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sign and Search: Sign Search Functionality for Sign Language Lexica" by Manolis Fragkiadakis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves a **Ghanaian Sign Language lexicon (GSL)**, which suggests that this is a primary dataset used in the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data-sets and Methods)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they mention two key datasets:

1. **Ghanaian Sign Language Lexicon (GSL)**: This dataset consists of 1200 signs compiled for educational purposes and is intended for use in a mobile application. It is crucial to note that this dataset is foundational for the study.

2. **Fragkiadakis et al. (2020) Dataset**: This dataset includes data from ten participants who performed the same 20 signs in front of a webcam. The authors mention that data from two participants were discarded due to inconsistencies, which is important for understanding the dataset's integrity.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their methods using these datasets, confirming their relevance to the experiments conducted.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Ghanaian Sign Language Lexicon (GSL)**, the citation is:
  > Fragkiadakis, M., Nyst, V., and Nyarko, M. (2021). Ghanaian Sign Language Lexicon. https://zenodo.org/record/4533753.

- For the **Fragkiadakis et al. (2020) Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Fragkiadakis, M., Nyst, V., and van der Putten, P. (2020). Signing as input for a dictionary query: matching signs based on joint positions of the dominant hand. In Proceedings of the 9th Workshop on the Representation and Processing of Sign Languages, pages 69â€“74. European Language Resources Association.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Ghanaian Sign Language Lexicon (GSL)**: A dataset of 1200 signs compiled for educational purposes.
2. **Fragkiadakis et al. (2020) Dataset**: A dataset containing data from ten participants performing 20 signs, with some data discarded due to inconsistencies.

Finally, I will compile these dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details and citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper.
