To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory for Video Description" by Yi Bin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method is verified on a commonly-used benchmark, specifically mentioning the **Microsoft Video Description (MSVD) corpus**. This indicates that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will move to the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the context of their research. They mention the increasing attention on video captioning and the need for effective techniques, but I will focus on identifying specific datasets mentioned in the text.

In the **experiments section**, particularly **section 3.1 (Dataset)**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Microsoft Research Video Description (MSVD)**: This dataset consists of 1,970 video clips, each depicting a single action or event, with an average of 43 sentences per video. The authors also specify the training, validation, and test splits for this dataset.

2. **COCO 2014 image description dataset**: This dataset contains over 120,000 images, with approximately 82,000 images for training and 40,000 for testing. The authors indicate that this dataset is used for transfer learning in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Microsoft Video Description (MSVD)** corpus, the citation is:
  > Chen, D. L., & Dolan, W. B. (2011). Collecting highly parallel data for paraphrase evaluation. In *Proceedings of the ACL*.

- For the **COCO 2014 image description dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Doll√°r, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context. In *European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)*.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research.
