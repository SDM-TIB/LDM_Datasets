To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dual-Path Cross-Modal Attention for Better Audio-Visual Speech Extraction" by Zhongweiyang Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **LRS3 test set** for evaluating their method, which indicates that this dataset is significant for their experiments. The introduction further discusses the challenges of audio-visual speech extraction and mentions various datasets, hinting at the presence of more than one dataset.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their approach and mention that they pretrain their model on the **GRID corpus** and evaluate it on the **LRS3 dataset**. This confirms that both datasets are crucial for their research.

Now, I will gather detailed descriptions of each dataset:

1. **GRID Corpus**: This dataset consists of 33 speakers, each providing 1000 3-second long utterances of simple sentences, with video capturing the frontal face area. It is used for pretraining the model.

2. **LRS3 Dataset**: This dataset is a large-scale dataset for visual speech recognition, specifically designed for the task of audio-visual speech extraction. The authors mention using a subset of 33,000 utterances from the LRS3 dataset for their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **GRID corpus**, the citation is:
  > M. Cooke, J. Barker, S. Cunningham, and X. Shao. *An audio-visual corpus for speech perception and automatic speech recognition*. The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, vol. 120, no. 5, pp. 2421â€“2424, 2006. [Online]. Available: https://doi.org/10.1121/1.2229005

- For the **LRS3 dataset**, the citation is:
  > T. Afouras, J. S. Chung, and A. Zisserman. *LRS3-TED: A large-scale dataset for visual speech recognition*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.00496, 2018.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
