To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Visual-speech Synthesis of Exaggerated Corrective Feedback" by Yaohua Bu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, implementation, and user study sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it mentions a method for exaggerated visual-speech feedback, it does not explicitly name any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for effective corrective feedback in computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) but do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **implementation section**, where the authors describe their methods in detail.

In **section 2 (Implementation)**, I will look for any references to datasets used for training or testing their models. The authors mention using **8000 text prompts with phone-level emphasis annotations** for synthesizing emphatic speech. However, they do not specify a dataset name here. I will also check if they refer to any existing datasets in the context of their visual exaggeration techniques.

Next, I will examine the **user study section**. The authors describe experiments conducted with participants but do not mention any datasets used for these experiments. They refer to "14 pairs of easily mispronounced words," but again, no specific dataset is cited.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets, I will check the **references section** for any cited works that may include datasets relevant to their research. I will look for papers that might have provided the data or methodologies that the authors built upon.

Upon reviewing the references, I find several papers that could potentially relate to datasets used in CAPT or visual-speech synthesis:

1. **"Grading the Severity of Mispronunciations in CAPT Based on Statistical Analysis and Computational Speech Perception"** by Jia Jia et al. (2014). This paper may contain datasets related to mispronunciation severity.
   - Citation: Jia Jia, Wai-Kim Leung, Yu-Hao Wu, Xiu-Long Zhang, Hao Wang, Lian-Hong Cai, and Helen M. Meng. *Grading the Severity of Mispronunciations in CAPT Based on Statistical Analysis and Computational Speech Perception*. Journal of Computer Science and Technology, 29(5), 751–761, 2014.

2. **"Audiovisual synthesis of exaggerated speech for corrective feedback in computer-assisted pronunciation training"** by Junhong Zhao et al. (2013). This paper may also reference datasets used for audiovisual synthesis.
   - Citation: Junhong Zhao, Hua Yuan, Wai-Kim Leung, Helen Meng, Jia Liu, and Shanhong Xia. *Audiovisual synthesis of exaggerated speech for corrective feedback in computer-assisted pronunciation training*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 8218–8222, 2013.

After identifying these references, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citations as required. Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset names, I will note the relevant papers that may contain datasets related to the research topic.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that all citations are correctly formatted and complete.
