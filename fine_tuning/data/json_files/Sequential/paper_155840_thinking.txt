To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TCFimt: Temporal Counterfactual Forecasting from Individual Multiple Treatment Perspective" by Pengfei Xi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "two real-world datasets from distinct fields," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the part where the authors describe their experimental settings. Here, they mention two datasets: 

1. **Games Dataset**: This dataset contains time-series gaming indicators from various game genres, collected from NetEase Games. The authors provide a summary table (Table 1) that includes statistics about the games, such as the number of events and event options.

2. **Tumour Dataset**: This dataset simulates the combined effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in lung cancer patients. The authors describe the treatment options available at each time step and reference a state-of-the-art bio-mathematical model used for evaluation.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the datasets themselves may not have dedicated citations if they are proprietary or not published in separate papers. In this case, I will note that the datasets are derived from specific sources:

- For the **Games Dataset**, the citation is:
  > NetEase Games. *Time-series gaming indicators dataset*. Collected from Jan. 2019 to Nov. 2020.

- For the **Tumour Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lim, B., Alaa, A., and van der Schaar, M. (2018). *Forecasting Treatment Responses Over Time Using Recurrent Marginal Structural Networks*. NeurIPS, 18: 7483â€“7493.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the necessary details and citations for each dataset. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
