To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improved Semantic Representations From Tree-Structured Long Short-Term Memory Networks" by Kai Sheng Tai, Richard Socher, and Christopher D. Manning, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on two tasks: predicting semantic relatedness and sentiment classification, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluations. In this section, they explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank**: This dataset is used for sentiment classification tasks. The authors state that it contains sentences sampled from movie reviews, with specific train/dev/test splits for binary and fine-grained classification tasks.

2. **SICK Dataset (Sentences Involving Compositional Knowledge)**: This dataset is used for the semantic relatedness task. The authors mention that it consists of 9927 sentence pairs with a specific train/dev/test split.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Y Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D Manning, and Andrew Y Ng. *Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality over a Sentiment Treebank*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2013.

- For the **SICK Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marco Marelli, Luisa Bentivogli, Marco Baroni, Raffaella Bernardi, Stefano Menini, and Roberto Zamparelli. *SemEval-2014 Task 1: Evaluation of Compositional Distributional Semantic Models on Full Sentences through Semantic Relatedness and Textual Entailment*. In Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval), 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for structured output or further processing.
