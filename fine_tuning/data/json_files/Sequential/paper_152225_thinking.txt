To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A General Framework for Density Based Time Series Clustering Exploiting a Novel Admissible Pruning Strategy" by Nurjahan Begum et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions the use of various case studies in domains such as astronomy, speech physiology, medicine, and entomology, which suggests that there may be specific datasets used in these contexts.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. For instance, the paper discusses the use of the **Electromagnetic Articulograph (EMA) dataset** and the **Pulsus dataset**, which are likely to be detailed in the experiments section.

In the **case studies section**, I will pay close attention to the descriptions of the datasets used in each case study. For example, the paper describes the **Pulsus dataset** as containing 500 PPGs from two sources, which is crucial information for dataset extraction.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. For example, the paper references the **MIMIC II Waveform Database** and the **UCR Time Series Classification Page**, which I will need to cite correctly.

Once I have identified the datasets and their details, I will compile the information, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as follows:

1. **Electromagnetic Articulograph Dataset**: 
   - Description: A dataset of lower-lip accelerometer time series movement data of 18 words collected from multiple speakers, totaling 414 objects.
   - Citation: Wang, J., et al. "Preliminary Test of A Real-time, Interactive Silent Speech Interface Based on Electromagnetic Articulograph." SLPAT, pp. 38-45, 2014.

2. **Pulsus Dataset**: 
   - Description: A dataset of 500 PPGs from the MIMIC II Waveform Database and additional sources, used to study Pulsus Paradoxus.
   - Citation: Goldberger, A. L., et al. "Physiobank, Physiotoolkit, and Physionet Components of A New Research Resource for Complex Physiologic Signals." Circulation, 101(23), e215-e220, 2000.

3. **PRID Dataset**: 
   - Description: A dataset used for person re-identification, containing 1,000 images of 12 different individuals.
   - Citation: Hirzer, M., et al. "Person Re-identification by Descriptive and Discriminative Classification." Image Analysis. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, pp. 91-102, 2011.

4. **Cricket Dataset**: 
   - Description: A dataset containing gesture signals performed by umpires, used for gesture recognition applications.
   - Citation: Chambers, G. S., et al. "Segmentation of Intentional Human Gestures for Sports Video Annotation." IEEE Multimedia Modelling Conference, 2004.

5. **uWaveGestureLibrary Dataset**: 
   - Description: A dataset containing eight simple gestures collected from participants using a Wii remote-based prototype.
   - Citation: Liu, J., et al. "uWave: Accelerometer-based Personalized Gesture Recognition and Its Applications." Pervasive and Mobile Computing, 2009.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that it is presented clearly and accurately, ready for any further processing or review.
