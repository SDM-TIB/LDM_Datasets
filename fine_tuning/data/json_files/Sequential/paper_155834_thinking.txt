To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Fast-Slow Encoder Based Transducer with Streaming Deliberation" by Ke Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on **Librispeech** and **in-house data**, which suggests that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will examine **section 3.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find specific information about each dataset, including their characteristics and any relevant details that describe their use in the study.

1. **Librispeech**: The paper states that the Librispeech corpus contains 960 hours of labeled speech. It mentions the extraction of 80-dimensional filter bank features and the application of SpecAugment for data augmentation. This dataset is crucial for the experiments conducted.

2. **Large-Scale In-House Data**: The authors describe their in-house dataset, which combines two sources totaling 40K hours of English video data and 20K hours of manually transcribed data. This dataset is also significant for the experiments and is characterized by its de-identification process and augmentation techniques.

After identifying the datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Librispeech**, the citation is:
  > Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. *Librispeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2015.

- For the **in-house data**, since it is a proprietary dataset created by the authors, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. However, I will note that it is derived from internal sources and describe its components as mentioned in the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations where applicable. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for any further processing or review.
