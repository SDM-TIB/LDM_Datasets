To extract datasets from the research paper titled "D2D-LSTM based Prediction of the D2D Diffusion Path in Mobile Social Networks" by Hao Xu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used for validation or experimentation.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of real data from mobile social networks (MSN) for their predictions. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find specific details about it.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors specifically mention using **Xender data** for their experiments. They describe the dataset in detail, including the number of users, the volume of data transferred, and the time frame of the data collection. 

The relevant details about the dataset are as follows:
- **Xender Dataset**: This dataset consists of sharing actions from users of the Xender application, which is a mobile app for device-to-device content sharing. The dataset includes data from approximately 30 million users and over 4 billion transfers of content files over a month.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Xender dataset. The paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself, but it references the application and its usage. Therefore, I will cite the Xender application as follows:
- For **Xender**, the citation is:
  > Xender. "Xender - Share Files Without Internet." [Xender Official Website](https://www.xender.com).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the Xender dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ensuring that it is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
