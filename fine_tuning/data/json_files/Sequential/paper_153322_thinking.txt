To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BSDAR: Beam Search Decoding with Attention Reward in Neural Keyphrase Generation" by Iftitahu Ni’mah et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but I will need to look deeper for specific dataset mentions.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of neural keyphrase generation and reference existing works, but I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 6 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention that the Seq2Seq model was trained on the **KP20k corpus**, which consists of approximately 530K documents and provides around 2M training sets after preprocessing. This is a significant dataset for keyphrase extraction.

Additionally, they reference several standard evaluation datasets for keyphrase extraction:
1. **Inspec**: Contains 201 documents.
2. **Krapivin**: Contains 201 documents.
3. **NUS**: Contains 156 documents.
4. **Semeval-2010**: Contains 242 documents.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. 

For the **KP20k corpus**, the citation is:
> Meng, R., Zhao, S., Han, S., He, D., Brusilovsky, P., & Chi, Y. (2017). Deep keyphrase generation. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers) (pp. 582–592). Association for Computational Linguistics.

For the **Inspec dataset**, the citation is:
> Hulth, A. (2003). Improved automatic keyword extraction given more linguistic knowledge. In Proceedings of the 2003 conference on Empirical methods in natural language processing (pp. 216–223).

For the **Krapivin dataset**, the citation is:
> Krapivin, M., Autayeu, A., & Marchese, M. (2008). Large dataset for keyphrases extraction. Tech. Rep. DISI-09-055, DISI, Trento, Italy.

For the **NUS dataset**, the citation is:
> Nguyen, T. D., & Kan, M.-Y. (2007). Key phrase extraction in scientific publications. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Asian Digital Libraries (pp. 317–326).

For the **Semeval-2010 dataset**, the citation is:
> Kim, S. N., Medelyan, O., Kan, M.-Y., & Baldwin, T. (2010). Semeval-2010 task 5: Automatic keyphrase extraction from scientific articles. In Proceedings of the 5th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, SemEval ’10 (pp. 21–26). Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
