To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modular Multi Target Tracking Using LSTM Networks" by Rishabh Verma, R Rajesh, and MS Easwaran, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference existing datasets relevant to their study. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

In the **methodology section**, particularly under the subsection titled "Data Generation For Training," the authors describe how they generated training data. They mention that they created **50,000 random tracks** with specific parameters, which indicates that they are using synthetic data rather than established datasets. However, I will also check if they reference any existing datasets for comparison or validation purposes.

I will then examine the **experiments and results sections** to see if the authors compare their method against any standard datasets or benchmarks. If they do, I will note the names of those datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

If the authors mention any datasets that are not original to their work, I will ensure to include the full citation for those datasets as well.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections for dataset mentions.
2. Identify any datasets used for training or evaluation.
3. Check the references for full citations of any datasets mentioned.
4. Compile the dataset information with proper citations for clarity and accessibility.
