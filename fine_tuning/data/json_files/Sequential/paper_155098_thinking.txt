To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Controllable Semantic Parsing via Retrieval Augmentation" by Panupong Pasupat, Yuan Zhang, and Kelvin Guu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the **MTOP dataset**, which is a key dataset used for evaluation in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their evaluation on the **English portion of the MTOP dataset**. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of training, development, and test queries, which indicates its significance in their research.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MTOP dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **MTOP dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li, H., Arora, A., Chen, S., Gupta, A., Gupta, S., & Mehdad, Y. (2021). MTOP: A comprehensive multilingual task-oriented semantic parsing benchmark. In Proceedings of the 16th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Main Volume (pp. 2950â€“2962). Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation for the MTOP dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.
