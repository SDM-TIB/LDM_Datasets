To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HiSA-SMFM: Historical and Sentiment Analysis based Stock Market Forecasting Model" by Ishu Gupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, which includes the use of historical and sentiment data for stock market prediction. This suggests that datasets related to stock prices and sentiment analysis are likely involved.

Next, I will examine **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors discuss the importance of stock market predictions and the factors influencing them. They mention the use of historical data from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and sentiment data from Twitter, indicating that these are key datasets for their research.

In **section 4 (Performance Evaluation)**, the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. They specifically mention:

1. **Tata Motors Dataset**: This dataset consists of historical stock price data obtained from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India. It includes features such as date, volume, closing price, opening price, highest price, lowest price, and adjusted closing price for a duration of one year.

2. **Sentiment Data from Twitter**: The sentiment data is collected using the Twitter API (Tweepy) and processed using TextBlob for sentiment analysis. This dataset includes tweets related to stock prices, classified into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Tata Motors Dataset**, the citation is:
  > National Stock Exchange of India. *Tata Motors Stock Price Data*. [Online]. Available: https://www.nseindia.com

- For the **Twitter Sentiment Data**, while there isn't a specific citation for the dataset itself, the methodology for sentiment analysis using Twitter is based on:
  > Tweepy. *Twitter API Documentation*. [Online]. Available: https://docs.tweepy.org/en/stable/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
