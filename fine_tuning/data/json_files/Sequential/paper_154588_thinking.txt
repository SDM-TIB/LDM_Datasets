To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Relational Weight Priors in Neural Networks for Abstract Pattern Learning and Language Modelling" by Radha Kopparti and Tillman Weyde, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of synthetic data for evaluating their proposed method, Embedded Relation Based Patterns (ERBP). They mention that their experiments involve learning abstract patterns from synthetic noise-free sequences, which indicates that synthetic datasets are utilized.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In **section 4 (Experiments: Abstract Pattern Recognition)**, the authors describe the datasets used for their rule learning experiments. They mention that they artificially generate data in the form of triples for various abstract patterns (AAA, AAB, ABA, ABB, ABC). This section provides details about how the datasets are constructed, including the vocabulary used and the distribution of training, validation, and test sets.

The authors specify that the sequences are divided into separate train, validation, and test sets with 50%, 25%, and 25% of the data, respectively. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

In **section 5 (Experiments: Language and Music Modelling)**, the authors mention using the **Wikitext-2 dataset** for character and word prediction tasks. This dataset is well-known in the NLP community and is used for evaluating language models.

The authors also refer to the **Essen Folk Song Collection** for pitch prediction tasks, which is another dataset relevant to their experiments.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper:

1. For the **Wikitext-2 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Merity, S., Xiong, C., Bradbury, J., & Socher, R. (2016). Pointer sentinel mixture models. *CoRR*, abs/1609.07843. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07843

2. For the **Essen Folk Song Collection**, the citation is:
   > Schaffrath, H. (1995). The Essen Folk Song Collection in the Humdrum Kern format. Database edited by David Huron, CCAHR, Menlo Park, CA. URL: http://kern.ccarh.org/cgi-bin/ksbrow

3. The synthetic datasets used for abstract pattern learning do not have a formal citation since they are generated by the authors for the purpose of the study. However, I will note that they are based on the patterns described in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation for proper referencing.
