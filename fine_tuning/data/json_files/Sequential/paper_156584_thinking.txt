To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning on JPEG-LDPC Compressed Images: Classifying with Syndromes" by Ahcen Aliouat and Elsa Dupraz, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the research but does not specify datasets. The introduction discusses the context of the research but does not name any datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Data and Experiments)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on three standard datasets: **MNIST**, **Fashion-MNIST**, and **CIFAR-10**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are relevant to the study.

In this section, the authors describe how they processed the images from these datasets for their experiments, but I need to ensure I have the full citations for each dataset. Therefore, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the complete citations for these datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

1. **MNIST Dataset**:
   > Y. LeCun, L. Bottou, Y. Bengio, and P. Haffner. "Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition." *Proceedings of the IEEE*, vol. 86, no. 11, pp. 2278â€“2324, 1998.

2. **Fashion-MNIST Dataset**:
   > H. Xiao, K. Rasul, and R. Vollgraf. "Fashion-mnist: a novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms." arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

3. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
   > A. Krizhevsky, G. Hinton, et al. "Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images." 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
