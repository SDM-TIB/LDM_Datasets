To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Shared Structures and Hierarchies for Multiple NLP Tasks" by Junkun Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions conducting extensive experiments on two types of tasks: text classification and sequence labeling, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In the text classification experiment, the authors describe using a dataset of 16 tasks, which includes product reviews and movie reviews. Specifically, they mention that the product reviews are extracted from a dataset constructed by Blitzer et al. (2007), and the movie reviews are from IMDB (Maas et al. 2011) and MR (Pang and Lee 2005). This indicates that I need to extract these datasets and their citations.

For the sequence labeling experiment, the authors state that they used the **OntoNotes 5.0 dataset** for their tasks, which includes part-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition, and semantic role labeling. I will need to note this dataset and its citation as well.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. For the **product reviews dataset**:
   > Blitzer, J.; Dredze, M.; Pereira, F.; et al. (2007). *Biographies, bollywood, boom-boxes and blenders: Domain adaptation for sentiment classification*. In ACL, volume 7, 440–447.

2. For the **IMDB dataset**:
   > Maas, A. L.; Daly, R. E.; Pham, P. T.; Huang, D.; Ng, A. Y.; and Potts, C. (2011). *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the ACL, 142–150.

3. For the **MR dataset**:
   > Pang, B., and Lee, L. (2005). *Seeing stars: Exploiting class relationships for sentiment categorization with respect to rating scales*. In Proceedings of the ACL, 115–124.

4. For the **OntoNotes 5.0 dataset**:
   > Weischedel, R.; Palmer, M.; Marcus, M.; Hovy, E.; Pradhan, S.; Ramshaw, L.; Xue, N.; Taylor, A.; Kaufman, J.; Franchini, M.; et al. (2013). *Ontonotes release 5.0 ldc2013t19*. Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia, PA.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research paper.
