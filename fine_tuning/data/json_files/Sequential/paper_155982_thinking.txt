To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inverting the Fundamental Diagram and Forecasting Boundary Conditions: How Machine Learning Can Improve Macroscopic Models for Traffic Flow" by Maya Briania, Emiliano Cristiania, and Elia Onofria, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize a dataset with flux and velocity data of vehicles collected by fixed sensors, which suggests that there is a specific dataset being referenced.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Discussing the data)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used. They mention that the dataset is provided by the Italian motorway company Autovie Venete S.p.A. and contains traffic data collected from fixed sensors along three highways in North-East Italy. This section will likely contain the specifics of the dataset, including the time frame, the number of records, and the types of data collected.

In this section, the authors specify that the dataset includes:
- Traffic data from fixed sensors located along the A23, A28, and part of the A4 highways.
- Data collected between September 2020 and March 2022.
- A total of 301,200 records per day on average, with each group of sensors providing data on vehicle counts, speeds, and classifications.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, since the dataset is proprietary and provided by Autovie Venete S.p.A., it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset as described in the paper. The citation for the dataset will be:
> Autovie Venete S.p.A. *Traffic data collected from fixed sensors along the A23, A28, and A4 highways in North-East Italy*. Data collected from September 2020 to March 2022.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset details, including its purpose and the type of data it contains, ensuring that I have accurately captured all relevant information from the paper.
