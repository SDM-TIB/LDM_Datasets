To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long Short Term Memory Networks for Bandwidth Forecasting in Mobile Broadband Networks under Mobility" by Konstantinos Kousias et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors leverage two open-source datasets for their study, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Performance Evaluation)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **5Gophers**: This dataset is described as the first open-source attempt to study the performance of 5G networks in commercial settings, featuring measurements from operational 5G networks in the US. The authors provide details about the dataset's structure, including the types of traces collected.

2. **NYU Metropolitan Mobile Bandwidth Trace (NYU-METS)**: This dataset comprises 4G LTE bandwidth measurements collected in the New York University metropolitan area. The authors also provide insights into the experimental setup and the nature of the data collected.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **5Gophers**, the citation is:
  > A. Narayanan, E. Ramadan, J. Carpenter, Q. Liu, Y. Liu, F. Qian, and Z.-L. Zhang. *A first look at commercial 5G performance on smartphones*. In Proceedings of The Web Conference 2020, pages 894–905, 2020.

- For **NYU-METS**, the citation is:
  > L. Mei, R. Hu, H. Cao, Y. Liu, Z. Han, F. Li, and J. Li. *Realtime mobile bandwidth prediction using LSTM neural network*. In International Conference on Passive and Active Network Measurement, pages 34–47, Springer, 2019.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for future reference or analysis.
