To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Legal-HNet: Mixing Legal Long-Context Tokens with Hartley Transform" by Daniele Giofré and Sneha Ghantasala, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new hybrid Seq2Seq architecture and the evaluation of models on public summarization datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **Datasets section** (which is likely to be found in the methods or experiments sections). Here, the authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for specific names of datasets, their sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **BillSum Dataset**: This dataset is introduced as a legislative summarization dataset containing 21,000 US bills from 1993 to 2018. The authors mention its complexity due to the technical nature of the bills and the length of the documents.

2. **PubMed Dataset**: This dataset consists of scientific articles from the biomedical domain, including 133,000 papers with their abstracts. It is noted for its suitability for testing methods capable of long document summarization.

3. **LexGLUE Benchmark**: This benchmark includes various legal text classification tasks and is based on diverse legal data such as US court decisions and contracts. The authors mention that they evaluated their models against this benchmark.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **BillSum Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kornilova, A., & Eidelman, V. (2019). BillSum: A Corpus for Automatic Summarization of US Legislation. In Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on New Frontiers in Summarization, pages 48–56, Hong Kong, China. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **PubMed Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cohan, A., Dernoncourt, F., Kim, D. S., Bui, T., Kim, S., Chang, W., & Goharian, N. (2018). A Discourse-Aware Attention Model for Abstractive Summarization of Long Documents.

Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **LexGLUE Benchmark**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
