To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Perceptual audio loss function for deep learning" by Dan Elbaz and Michael Zibulevsky, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experimental results sections** to locate any datasets that are explicitly referenced. In the abstract, the authors discuss using the Wavenet architecture for predicting PESQ scores, but they do not mention any datasets directly.

Next, I will examine **section 1 (Problem formulation and related work)** and **section 2 (Method description)** for any references to datasets. Here, I find that the authors mention using the **TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus** for training their Wavenet model. This is a significant dataset for speech processing tasks.

In **section 3 (Experimental results)**, the authors reiterate the use of the TIMIT dataset, confirming its role in their experiments. This provides further validation that this dataset is central to their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citation for the TIMIT dataset. The citation provided is:

- **TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus**:
  > J. S. Garofolo, L. F. Lamel, W. M. Fisher, J. G. Fiscus, D. S. Pallett, and N. L. Dahlgren. *Darpa timit acoustic phonetic continuous speech corpus cdrom*, 1993.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

After completing these steps, I will have a clear entry for the dataset used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
