To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding Neural Architecture Search Techniques" by George Adam and Jonathan Lorraine, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors discuss the **Penn Treebank dataset** as the primary dataset used for their experiments. They mention that the ENAS search space is highly constrained since the local computation performed at each node is known to be effective for RNNs, and they specifically state that the architectures generated do not vary significantly in performance because they all have high enough capacity to fit the Penn Treebank data set.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Penn Treebank dataset. The citation is as follows:

- For the **Penn Treebank dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marcus, M. P., Santorini, B., & Marcinkiewicz, M. A. (1993). *Building a Large Annotated Corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2), 313-330.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the Penn Treebank dataset, I will document this dataset and its citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
