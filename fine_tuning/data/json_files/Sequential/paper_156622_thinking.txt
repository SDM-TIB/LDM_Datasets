To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Towards Efficient and Real-Time Piano Transcription Using Neural Autoregressive Models" by Taegyun Kwon et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using the **MAESTRO dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will focus on the **Experiments section** where the authors provide a detailed overview of the datasets used. In this section, they mention five piano music datasets, which I will need to summarize:

1. **MAESTRO**: The authors describe this as the largest public dataset for piano music transcription, containing performances recorded through Yamaha Disklavier pianos. They note that they used versions 1 and 3 for their experiments.

2. **MAPS**: This dataset includes synthesized and acoustic piano recordings. The authors specify that they used only the acoustic piano sets from this dataset.

3. **Vienna 4x22 Corpus**: This dataset consists of recordings of classical pieces played by multiple pianists. The authors mention that they manually aligned the MIDI with the audio.

4. **Saarland Music Dataset (SMD)**: The authors used the piano subset of this dataset, which includes performances by students on a Yamaha Disklavier.

5. **In-house Dataset**: This dataset comprises recordings of piano performances collected by the authors, featuring brief excerpts from classical compositions.

After identifying these datasets, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **MAESTRO**:

- For **MAPS**:

  > Müller, M., Konz, V., Bogler, W., & Arifi-Müller, V. (2011). Saarland music data (SMD). In Late-Breaking and Demo Session of the 12th International Conference on Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR).

- For **In-house Dataset**: Since this dataset is collected by the authors, it may not have a formal citation, but I will note it as an in-house dataset.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
