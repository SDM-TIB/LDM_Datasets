To extract datasets from the research paper titled "raceBERT – A Transformer-based Model for Predicting Race and Ethnicity from Names" by Prasanna Parasurama, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the model is trained on a **U.S. Florida voter registration dataset**, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further context. The introduction discusses the importance of using proxies like names to predict race, but it does not introduce any new datasets.

In the **data section (Section 2)**, the paper explicitly describes the **U.S. Florida voter registration dataset** in detail, including the total number of names and the race categories. This section provides essential information about the dataset's composition, which is crucial for understanding its application in the study.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. In the **models section (Section 3)**, the author mentions using the **Wikipedia ethnicity dataset** for training a model from scratch. This dataset is also described in detail, including the ethnicity categories and counts.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for both datasets:

1. For the **U.S. Florida voter registration dataset**, the citation is:
   > Sood, Gaurav, and Suriyan Laohaprapanon. (2018). “Predicting Race and Ethnicity From the Sequence of Characters in a Name”. In: arXiv:1805.02109 [stat]. arXiv: 1805.02109 [stat].

2. For the **Wikipedia ethnicity dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ambekar, Anurag et al. (2009). “Name-Ethnicity Classification from Open Sources”. In: Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining - KDD ’09. Paris, France: ACM Press, p. 49.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **U.S. Florida voter registration dataset**: Contains 13,089,545 names across 5 race categories (Non-hispanic White, Hispanic, Non-hispanic Black, Asian & Pacific Islander, American Indian & Alaskan Native).

- **Wikipedia ethnicity dataset**: Contains various ethnicity categories with counts, used to evaluate the model's performance.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
