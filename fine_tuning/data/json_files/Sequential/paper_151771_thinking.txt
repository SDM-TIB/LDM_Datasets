To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequence-to-Sequence Prediction of Vehicle Trajectory via LSTM Encoder-Decoder Architecture" by Seong Hyeon Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method and mentions that experiments were conducted on highway traffic scenarios, which suggests that there may be a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **data collection section** (Section IV.A), where the authors describe how they collected vehicle trajectory data. They mention that they collected a large set of vehicle trajectory data from several hours of highway driving around Seoul, Korea, using a Hyundai Genesis equipped with Delphi long-range front radars. This indicates that there is a specific dataset used for their experiments.

In this section, the authors specify that they recorded a total of **1325 trajectory sequences** from **26 different highway scenarios**, including lane changes, cut-ins, and merging at junctions. They also mention the sampling rate and how they processed the data to cope with noise, which is important for understanding the dataset's characteristics.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset. Since the dataset is derived from their own data collection, I will create a citation based on the information provided in the paper. The citation will include the authors, title, and details about the dataset:

- **Vehicle Trajectory Dataset**: 
  > Seong Hyeon Park, ByeongDo Kim, Chang Mook Kang, Chung Choo Chung, and Jun Won Choi. *Vehicle Trajectory Dataset from Highway Driving in Seoul, Korea*. Collected using a Hyundai Genesis equipped with Delphi long-range front radars, 2023.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the dataset is properly documented and can be referenced in future work.
