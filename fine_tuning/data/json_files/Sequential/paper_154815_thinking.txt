To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discrete Auto-regressive Variational Attention Models for Text Modeling" by Xianghong Fang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on language modeling tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention three benchmark datasets for language modeling: **Yahoo Answers**, **Penn Treebank (PTB)**, and a down-sampled version of **SNLI**. I will look for specific details about each dataset, such as the size of the training, validation, and test sets, as well as any relevant statistics.

In the **experiments section**, I find a table summarizing the dataset statistics, which provides the following details:

1. **Yahoo Answers**: 
   - Train Size: 100,000
   - Validation Size: 10,000
   - Test Size: 10,000
   - Average Length: 78.7

2. **Penn Treebank (PTB)**: 
   - Train Size: 42,068
   - Validation Size: 3,370
   - Test Size: 3,761
   - Average Length: 23.1

3. **SNLI**: 
   - Train Size: 100,000
   - Validation Size: 10,000
   - Test Size: 10,000
   - Average Length: 9.7

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Yahoo Answers**, the citation is:
  > J. Xu and G. Durrett, “Spherical latent spaces for stable variational autoencoders,” in EMNLP, 2018.

- For **Penn Treebank (PTB)**, the citation is:
  > M. P. Marcus, B. Santorini, and M. A. Marcinkiewicz, “Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank,” Computational Linguistics, 1993.

- For **SNLI**, the citation is:
  > S. R. Bowman, G. Angeli, C. Potts, and C. D. Manning, “A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference,” EMNLP, 2015.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
