To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Posterior-Guided Neural Architecture Search" by Yizhou Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention validating their method on **Cifar-10, Cifar-100, and ImageNet**, which indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 3) to find detailed descriptions of how these datasets were utilized. The authors explicitly state that they tested their method on **Cifar-10**, **Cifar-100**, and **ImageNet**. I will note down the context in which these datasets were used, such as the performance metrics reported.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide specific results for each dataset:
- For **Cifar-10**, they report a test error of 1.98% after 11 GPU days.
- For **Cifar-100**, they report a test error of 14.28% after the same amount of GPU time.
- For **ImageNet**, they mention that their method was directly searched on this dataset, achieving competitive results.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for these datasets are as follows:

- For **Cifar-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **Cifar-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
