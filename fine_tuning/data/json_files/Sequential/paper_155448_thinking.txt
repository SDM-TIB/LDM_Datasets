To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequencer: Deep LSTM for Image Classification" by Yuki Tatsunami and Masato Taki, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on the **ImageNet-1K** dataset, which is a well-known dataset in image classification tasks. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail, particularly the **experiments** section. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup and the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will pay close attention to any mentions of datasets, their sizes, and their characteristics.

Upon reviewing the **experiments** section, I find that the authors explicitly mention using the **ImageNet-1K** dataset for training their models. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of classes and images, which is crucial for understanding its scope.

Additionally, the authors reference several other datasets in the context of transfer learning experiments, including:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
3. **Flowers-102**: A dataset with 8,189 images of flowers belonging to 102 categories.
4. **Stanford Cars**: A dataset containing 8,144 images of cars belonging to 196 classes.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **ImageNet-1K**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E. Hinton. *ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks*. In NeurIPS, volume 25, pages 1097–1105, 2012.

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**:

  > Jonathan Krause, Michael Stark, Jia Deng, and Li Fei-Fei. *3D Object Representations for Fine-Grained Categorization*. In ICCVW, pages 554–561, 2013.

With this information gathered, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
