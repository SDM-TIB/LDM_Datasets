To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LSTM-Based Video Quality Prediction Accounting for Temporal Distortions in Videoconferencing Calls" by Gabriel Mittag et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors present a data-driven approach using subjective quality ratings labeled via crowdsourcing, which suggests the existence of a dataset.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they created. They describe the dataset as containing recordings from live Microsoft Teams calls, specifying that it includes 1628 videos collected under 83 different network conditions. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's composition, including the number of videos, the conditions under which they were recorded, and the method of annotation.

In this section, the authors also mention that the videos were annotated for overall quality using an Absolute Category Rating (ACR) scale according to ITU-T Recommendation P.910, which further confirms the dataset's relevance and structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ITU-T Recommendation P.910, as it is essential for understanding the quality assessment method used in the dataset. The citation is as follows:
> ITU-T Rec. P.910, “Subjective video quality assessment methods for multimedia applications,” 2022.

Additionally, I will note that the dataset is open-sourced and available at a specified GitHub link, which is important for accessibility.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation for the ITU-T Recommendation P.910, as it is integral to the dataset's methodology.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and completeness.
