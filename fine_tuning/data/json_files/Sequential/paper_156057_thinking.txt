To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mispronunciation Detection of Basic Quranic Recitation Rules using Deep Learning" by Ahmad Al Harere and Khloud Al Jallad, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a public dataset called the **QDAT dataset**, which contains over 1500 voices of correct and incorrect recitations of three Tajweed rules. This is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look closely at the **methodology section**, specifically section 3.1, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the QDAT dataset includes recordings of both genders and various age groups, focusing on three specific Tajweed rules: Separate stretching, Tight Noon, and Hide. This section provides essential details about the dataset's content and structure.

I will also check the **data availability section** to confirm the dataset's accessibility. The authors provide a link to the dataset hosted on Kaggle, which is crucial for citation and further reference.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the QDAT dataset from the references section. The relevant citation is:

- For the **QDAT dataset**:
  > H. M. Osman, B. S. Mustafa, and Y. Faisal. *QDAT: A data set for Reciting the Quran*. International Journal on Islamic Applications in Computer Science And Technology, pp. 1â€“9, 2021. Available: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350785609_QDAT_A_data_set_for_Reciting_the_Quran.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as it is critical for proper referencing. 

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for output, ensuring that it is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
