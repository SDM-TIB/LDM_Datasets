To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Future Terrorist Targets Through Temporal Meta-Graphs" by Gian Maria Campedelli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors use real-world data on attacks in Afghanistan and Iraq from 2001 to 2018, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **data section** of the paper, which is likely to provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this case, the authors mention the **Global Terrorism Database (GTD)** as the primary source of their data. They specify that the GTD includes data on over 200,000 terrorist events and outlines the criteria for inclusion in the dataset.

In the **Appendix A**, the authors provide descriptive statistics for the datasets derived from the GTD, specifically for Afghanistan and Iraq. They mention the total number of attacks recorded, the number of attacks filtered for analysis, and the dimensions of the datasets, including tactics, weapons, and targets.

The datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Afghanistan Dataset**: This dataset includes 12,106 terrorist attacks from 2001 to 2018, focusing on three dimensions: tactics, weapons, and targets. The authors provide detailed statistics on the number of occurrences for each tactic, weapon, and target type.

2. **Iraq Dataset**: Similar to the Afghanistan dataset, this dataset includes 22,764 terrorist attacks from 2001 to 2018, also focusing on tactics, weapons, and targets. The authors again provide detailed statistics for this dataset.

Now, I will retrieve the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **Global Terrorism Database (GTD)**, the citation is:
  > LaFree, G., & Dugan, L. (2007). Introducing the Global Terrorism Database. *Terrorism and Political Violence*, 19(2), 181-204. doi:10.1080/09546550701216224.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
