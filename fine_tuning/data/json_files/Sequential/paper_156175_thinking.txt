To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Political Sentiment Analysis of Persian Tweets Using CNN-LSTM Model" by Mohammad Dehghani and Zahra Yazdanparast, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted sentiment analysis on Persian political tweets using two datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section** where the authors describe their approach in detail. In this section, they explicitly mention that they analyzed two Persian political tweets datasets. The first dataset is categorized into three classes based on sentiment polarity (positive, negative, and neutral), while the second dataset has seven emotion categories (happy, sad, hopeless, hopeful, angry, apathy, and others). This gives me a clear understanding of the datasets' structure and purpose.

I will then look for any specific names or identifiers for these datasets. The authors do not provide formal names for the datasets in the text, but they do describe their characteristics and the context in which they were collected. Since the datasets are derived from Twitter, I will note that they are likely based on tweets collected during specific political events or timeframes.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if the authors cite any previous works or datasets that could provide more context or formal citations. However, it appears that the datasets are original collections by the authors and do not have external citations.

For the purpose of documentation, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **First Dataset**: This dataset consists of Persian political tweets categorized into three sentiment classes: positive, negative, and neutral. The dataset is used to evaluate sentiment analysis models.

2. **Second Dataset**: This dataset contains Persian political tweets categorized into seven emotion classes: happy, sad, hopeless, hopeful, angry, apathy, and others. It is used to evaluate emotion detection models.

Since the datasets do not have formal citations, I will note that they are original datasets collected by the authors for their research. I will also include the authors' names and the title of the paper for reference.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines the datasets, their characteristics, and the context in which they were used, ensuring that the citations for the paper are included for proper attribution.
