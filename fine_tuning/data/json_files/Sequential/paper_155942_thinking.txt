To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MCWDST: a Minimum-Cost Weighted Directed Spanning Tree Algorithm for Real-Time Fake News Mitigation in Social Media" by Ciprian-Octavian TruicÄƒ et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their solution on five real-world datasets, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section V (Experimental Results)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention using four datasets for fake news detection and one dataset for evaluating mitigation metrics. I will extract the names and details of these datasets.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Fake News Corpus (FNC)**: Contains over 9.4 million articles labeled with 11 predefined labels. The authors selected a balanced subset of 20,000 articles tagged as either reliable or fake.

2. **Kaggle Dataset**: Downloaded from the Kaggle Fake News Detection challenge, consisting of 20,800 articles tagged as reliable or unreliable. After cleaning, it contains 10,387 reliable and 10,374 unreliable articles.

3. **GossipCop Dataset**: Comprises 22,155 news titles, URLs, tweet IDs, and labels indicating whether articles are true or fake. The authors selected 5,323 articles to represent both tags.

4. **Fakeddit Dataset**: A multimodal dataset allowing for various classification types. The authors used 107,742 posts with a 1:1 true-to-fake ratio, excluding entries with images.

5. **Twitter15 Dataset**: Contains news articles and their labels, along with information on the directed network structure among users. The authors selected 361 articles identified as false for their analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
