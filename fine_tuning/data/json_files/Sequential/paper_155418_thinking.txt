To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FIX BUGS WITH TRANSFORMER THROUGH A NEURAL-SYMBOLIC EDIT GRAMMAR" by Yaojie Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that "NSEdit is evaluated on various code repair datasets," which indicates that there are specific datasets used for evaluation. However, it does not name them directly, so I will need to look further.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In **Section 4.1**, the authors mention achieving state-of-the-art performance on the **Tufano small dataset** of the CodeXGLUE benchmark. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper. In **Section 4.3**, the authors describe curating an in-house dataset from publicly available 10K GitHub Java packages, which they mention is used for their experiments. This dataset is significant and should be noted.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **references section** of the paper:

1. **Tufano small dataset**:
   - Citation: 
     > Michele Tufano, Cody Watson, Gabriele Bavota, Massimiliano Di Penta, Martin White, and Denys Poshyvanyk. *An empirical study on learning bug-fixing patches in the wild via neural machine translation*. ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM), 28(4):1â€“29, 2019.

2. **In-house dataset from GitHub**:
   - Since this dataset is created by the authors and not published in a separate paper, I will note it as:
     > Yaojie Hu et al. *In-house dataset curated from publicly available 10K GitHub Java packages*. (Details on dataset generation can be found in Section 4.3 of the paper).

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and their full citations, which are crucial for proper referencing and validation in future research.
