To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning for Short-term Instant Energy Consumption Forecasting in the Manufacturing Sector" by Nuno Oliveira et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and materials and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the application of deep learning algorithms in a real testbed within the manufacturing sector, which suggests that there may be a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Materials and Methods)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that data was collected from 10 energy consumption analysers over a period of approximately two years, specifically from January 1, 2020, to December 1, 2021. This indicates that there is a substantial dataset being utilized.

In **subsection 3.1 (Dataset)**, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset, including the number of records (approximately 2,200,000) and the specific analysers used. They clarify that only data from analysers 6 and 7 were considered for the study, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, as it is based on data collected from the Cyberfactory#1 project. However, I will note that the dataset is derived from a real-life manufacturing context, which is significant for its application.

The relevant citation for the Cyberfactory#1 project, which encompasses the dataset, is:
> Cyberfactory#1. https://cyberfactory-1.sistrade.com/. Accessed: 2022-04-19.

Since the dataset is not published in a traditional sense with a formal citation, I will include the project reference as the dataset's citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the context of the data collection and the citation, into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that all necessary details are captured for anyone reviewing the datasets used in this research.
