To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Precipitation Nowcasting Using a Stochastic Variational Frame Predictor with Learned Prior Distribution" by Alex Bihlo, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract indicates that the proposed method is trained on two-dimensional rain radar reflectivity maps for precipitation nowcasting. This suggests that radar data is a key dataset, but I need to confirm the specifics.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **data** sections, as these are likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In the **data section**, the author mentions that the radar data was provided by Austro Control and consists of two-dimensional reflectivity maps recorded by four weather radar stations over the Austrian region. The original resolution of the data is noted, along with the down-sampling process and the classes of converted rain rates.

I will summarize the dataset details as follows:

1. **Radar Data**: This dataset consists of two-dimensional reflectivity maps recorded by four weather radar stations (Feldkirchen, Patscherkofel, Rauchenwarth, Zirbitzkogel) over Austria. The data spans five years (January 2014 to December 2018), with four years used for training and one year for testing. The resolution is originally 1 km × 1 km, down-sampled to 5 km × 5 km, and includes converted rain rates categorized into 14 classes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the radar data. However, since the radar data is proprietary and provided by Austro Control, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note the source as follows:

- **Radar Data**: Austro Control, Austrian air navigation service provider. The dataset consists of two-dimensional reflectivity maps recorded by four weather radar stations over the Austrian region from January 2014 to December 2018.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their sources. This will allow me to compile the dataset entries for further processing or review.
