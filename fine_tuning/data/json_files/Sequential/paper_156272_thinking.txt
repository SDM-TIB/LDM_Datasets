To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Quantum Recurrent Reinforcement Learning via Quantum Reservoir Computing" by Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for validation or testing. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. In this paper, the author mentions using the **MiniGrid-Empty environment** for testing the quantum reinforcement learning agent. This environment is crucial for understanding the experimental setup.

I will also check the **related work section** to see if any datasets are referenced that are commonly used in the field of quantum reinforcement learning or reinforcement learning in general. This could provide additional context or alternative datasets that are relevant to the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. In this case, the MiniGrid environment is referenced, and I will need to ensure I capture the correct citation for it.

The citation for the MiniGrid environment is:
> Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert, Lucas Willems, and Suman Pal. "Minimalistic gridworld environment for openai gym." https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid, 2018.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
