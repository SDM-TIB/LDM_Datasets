To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning hierarchical behavior and motion planning for autonomous driving" by Jingke Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of a learning-based driving solution and mentions the integration of a classical sampling-based motion planner, which may imply the use of specific datasets for training or evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this paper, I will look for sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets," "Experimental Setup," or similar headings.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using two primary simulation environments for their experiments:

1. **SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility)**: This is an event-based simulator used for demonstrating behavior in the paper. The authors state that they utilize SUMO to train a behavior policy for initialization.

2. **CARLA (Car Learning to Act)**: This is a dynamic simulator where the main experiments are conducted. The authors mention that they train their model on CARLA and validate its performance in various scenarios.

Now, I will look for the full citations of these datasets in the **References section** of the paper. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I find are:

- For **SUMO**:
  > M. Behrisch, L. Bieker, J. Erdmann, and D. Krajzewicz. *SUMO â€“ Simulation of Urban Mobility: An Overview*. In Proceedings of SIMUL 2011, The Third International Conference on Advances in System Simulation, ThinkMind, 2011.

- For **CARLA**:
  > A. Dosovitskiy, G. Ros, F. Codevilla, A. Lopez, and V. Koltun. *CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.03938, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for future reference.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be used for further analysis or sharing with others interested in the research.
