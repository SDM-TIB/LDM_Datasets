To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WaveNet-Based Deep Neural Networks for the Characterization of Anomalous Diffusion" by Dezhong Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the Anomalous Diffusion (AnDi) Challenge, which suggests that there are datasets involved in the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.1 (Tasks, evaluation metrics, and datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their work. Here, they mention that the datasets in the AnDi Challenge consist of simulated trajectories generated by an open-source Python package called **andi-dataset**. This is a crucial piece of information as it indicates the source of the data.

The authors provide a brief overview of the **andi-dataset**, stating that it is based on five theoretical diffusion models and that it includes a test dataset consisting of 10,000 trajectories generated for leaderboard scoring. They also mention that the training dataset is generated using the same package, which is important for understanding the context of the datasets used.

In the **methods section**, they detail how the trajectories are generated, including the parameters such as trajectory lengths and noise levels. This information is essential for understanding the characteristics of the datasets.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the **andi-dataset** in the **References section**. The relevant citation is:
> Mu√±oz-Gil G, Manzo C, Volpe G, Garcia-March M A, Metzler R, and Lewenstein M. *The anomalous diffusion challenge dataset*. URL: https://zenodo.org/record/3707702.

This citation provides the necessary details about the dataset used in the study.

Finally, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **andi-dataset** as it is critical for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent work or analysis.
