To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Ensemble Approach to Question Classification: Integrating Electra Transformer, GloVe, and LSTM" by Sanad Aburass et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the model was rigorously tested on the **TREC dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the importance of question classification and mention that their ensemble model was evaluated on the **TREC dataset**, confirming its relevance.

In the **data preparation section**, the authors explicitly state that the **TREC question classification dataset** was used for their experiments. They describe it as containing text-based questions associated with coarse labels like 'location' and 'person'. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's purpose and structure.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the TREC dataset. The TREC dataset is widely recognized in the field, and I will ensure to provide its authoritative citation.

The citation for the TREC dataset is:
> D. Zhang and W. S. Lee, "Question classification using support vector machines," in Proceedings of the 26th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval, New York, NY, USA: ACM, Jul. 2003, pp. 26â€“32. doi: 10.1145/860435.860443.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation in the required format.

In summary, I will extract the following dataset:
1. **TREC Dataset**: A dataset containing text-based questions associated with coarse labels like 'location', 'person', etc.

Now, I will prepare to format this information according to the specified requirements for further processing.
