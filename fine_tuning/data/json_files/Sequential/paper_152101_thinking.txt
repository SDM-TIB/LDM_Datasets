To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Proof Synthesis Guided by Neural Machine Translation for Intuitionistic Propositional Logic" by Taro Sekiyama et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Preliminary Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for training their neural network models. They mention generating a dataset of type-term pairs for training, which is crucial for understanding the data they worked with.

In **Procedure 2 (Generation of training dataset)**, the authors describe how they generated a dataset consisting of 1000 pairs of types and closed hole-free terms. This is a clear indication of a dataset being created for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to existing datasets or methodologies that might have been used to create their dataset. However, it appears that the dataset is generated by the authors themselves, and thus may not have a formal citation.

The key datasets identified in the paper are:

1. **Generated Dataset (Dtm)**: This dataset consists of 1000 pairs of types and closed hole-free terms generated by the authors using a specific procedure. The dataset is not publicly available and is created for the purpose of training their seq2seq model.

2. **Generated Dataset (Dβη)**: Similar to Dtm, this dataset contains only βη-normal forms and is also generated by the authors for training purposes.

Since these datasets are generated and not sourced from existing repositories, they do not have formal citations. However, I will note the procedures used to create them as part of the dataset description.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the details about how the datasets were generated and their significance in the context of the research. This will help in documenting the datasets effectively for future reference or analysis.
