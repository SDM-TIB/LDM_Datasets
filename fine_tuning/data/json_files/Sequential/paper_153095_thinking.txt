To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evolving Robust Neural Architectures to Defend from Adversarial Attacks" by Shashank Kotyan and Danilo Vasconcellos Vargas, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and previous work, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss adversarial attacks and neural architecture search (NAS), but they do not explicitly mention any datasets yet. I will continue to the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed.

In **section 4 (Searching for Robust Architectures)**, the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset** to generate adversarial samples. This is a crucial dataset for their experiments, and I will note its details.

Next, I will check the **tables and figures** for any additional datasets or specific details about the datasets used. In **Table 1**, the authors summarize the number of adversarial samples generated from various types of attacks, but they do not introduce new datasets here.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **CIFAR-10 dataset**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, 2009.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the CIFAR-10 dataset for generating adversarial samples, I will compile this information into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's name, description, and full citation, ready for further processing or review.
