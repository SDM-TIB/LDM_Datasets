To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Max-Pooling Loss Training of Long Short-Term Memory Networks for Small-Footprint Keyword Spotting" by Ming Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of LSTM models for keyword spotting, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors mention using an **in-house far-field corpus** for their experiments. This corpus is crucial as it contains a significant amount of keyword and background speech utterances. However, the paper does not provide a specific name for this dataset, which is a common practice in proprietary research.

I will also check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited there. The references primarily discuss previous works and methodologies but do not provide specific datasets used in this study.

Since the authors mention that the dataset is collected in a far-field environment and is proprietary, I will note that while I cannot provide a full citation for this dataset, I will document its description as follows:

1. **In-house Far-Field Corpus**: This dataset contains a large number of instances of the keyword "Alexa" and background speech utterances collected under various conditions. It is specifically designed for training and testing small-footprint keyword spotting systems.

Since there are no formal citations for this dataset in the paper, I will acknowledge that it is an in-house dataset and cannot be referenced in the same way as publicly available datasets.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring to highlight the proprietary nature of the dataset and its relevance to the research conducted.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
- Read through the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
- Focus on the experimental results section for specific dataset details.
- Note the proprietary nature of the in-house dataset and its significance in the study.

This approach ensures that I accurately capture the dataset information while adhering to the citation requirements as best as possible given the context.
