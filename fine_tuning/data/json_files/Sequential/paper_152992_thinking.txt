To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multinomial Distribution Learning for Effective Neural Architecture Search" by Xiawu Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions experiments on **CIFAR-10** and **ImageNet**, indicating that these are likely the datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look closely at **section 5.1.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, with images normalized to color intensities in the range of [-1, +1]. It has 10 classes and an image size of 32x32 pixels.

2. **ImageNet**: The authors mention using the ILSVRC 2012 ImageNet dataset, which contains 1,000 classes, 1.28 million training images, and 50,000 validation images. The input image size for their experiments is set to 224x224 pixels.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for the full citations of these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoff Hinton. *Convolutional deep belief networks on CIFAR-10*. Unpublished manuscript, 40(7), 2010.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *Imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge*. International journal of computer vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the specified requirements, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
