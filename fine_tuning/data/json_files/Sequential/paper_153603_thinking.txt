To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A new approach for Trading based on Long-Short Term memory technique" by Zineb Lanbouri and Saaid Achchab, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study applies an ensemble LSTM model to predict stock prices based on data from 417 NY stock exchange companies, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of financial time series forecasting and mention various machine learning techniques, but I need to look for specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their data exploration process. They mention using a database containing New York Stock Exchange S&P500 data, which is publicly available at a specific Kaggle link. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used.

The paper states that the dataset is split into two parts:
1. **Daily features dataset**: This includes Open, High, Low, Close prices, Volume, and daily indicators like MACD and RSI.
2. **Annual features dataset**: This contains 75 financial annual ratios for the companies.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that their empirical experiment is applied to the 417 NYSE companies, reinforcing the use of these datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to the datasets mentioned. The paper references a Kaggle dataset, which I will need to cite properly. The citation for the NYSE dataset is:
> Gawlik, D. (2017). *New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) dataset*. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/dgawlik/nyse.

Since the paper does not provide specific citations for the daily and annual features datasets, I will use the Kaggle dataset citation as the authoritative source for the data used in the study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will include the dataset name, description, and citation for the NYSE dataset.
