To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MeDAL: Medical Abbreviation Disambiguation Dataset for Natural Language Understanding Pretraining" by Zhi Wen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the MeDAL dataset, which is specifically designed for abbreviation disambiguation in the medical domain. This indicates that the dataset is central to the paper's contributions.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (Abbreviation Disambiguation)**, where the authors provide a detailed summary of the MeDAL dataset. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of **14,393,619 articles** with an average of **3 abbreviations per article**. This section will provide key statistics and insights into the dataset's structure and purpose.

In **section 3 (Evaluation Tasks)**, the authors discuss two downstream tasks that utilize the MeDAL dataset: **mortality prediction** and **diagnosis prediction**. They mention that the mortality prediction dataset is generated from the **MIMIC-III** database, which is another dataset relevant to this research. I will need to extract details about both the MeDAL dataset and the MIMIC-III dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **MeDAL Dataset**: The authors do not provide a formal citation for the MeDAL dataset itself, but they reference their GitHub repository where it can be accessed:
   > MeDAL Dataset. Available at: https://github.com/BruceWen120/medal

2. **MIMIC-III Dataset**: The citation for the MIMIC-III dataset is provided in the references section:
   > Alistair E.W. Johnson, Tom J. Pollard, Lu Shen, Li Wei H. Lehman, Mengling Feng, Mohammad Ghassemi, Benjamin Moody, Peter Szolovits, Leo Anthony Celi, and Roger G. Mark. *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific Data, 3(1):1â€“9, 2016.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
