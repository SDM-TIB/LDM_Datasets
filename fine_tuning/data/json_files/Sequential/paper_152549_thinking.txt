To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "The Lower The Simpler: Simplifying Hierarchical Recurrent Models" by Chao Wang and Hui Jiang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction may provide context and mention datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Experimental Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two dialogue datasets and one MRC dataset:

1. **MovieTriples**: This dataset contains over 240,000 dialogues collected from various movie scripts, with each dialogue consisting of three sentences.

2. **Ubuntu**: This dataset consists of over 490,000 dialogues collected from Ubuntu chat logs, with each dialogue averaging seven sentences.

3. **SQuAD**: This dataset contains over 100,000 passage-question pairs with human-generated answer spans, where the passages are sourced from Wikipedia.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will look for are:

- For **MovieTriples**, the citation is:
  > Iulian Vlad Serban, Alessandro Sordoni, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron C Courville, and Joelle Pineau. *Building end-to-end dialogue systems using generative hierarchical neural network models*. In AAAI, volume 16, pages 3776–3784, 2016.

- For **Ubuntu**, the citation is:
  > Ryan Thomas Lowe, Nissan Pow, Iulian Vlad Serban, Laurent Charlin, Chia-Wei Liu, and Joelle Pineau. *Training end-to-end dialogue systems with the ubuntu dialogue corpus*. Dialogue & Discourse, 8(1):31–65, 2017.

- For **SQuAD**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.05250, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
