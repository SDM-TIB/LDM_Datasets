To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AutoDO: Robust AutoAugment for Biased Data with Label Noise via Scalable Probabilistic Implicit Differentiation" by Denis Gudovskiy et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions experiments on **SVHN, CIFAR-10/100, and ImageNet classification**, indicating that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look specifically at the **experiments section** (section 5) to confirm the datasets used and gather details about them. The authors describe their experimental setup, mentioning that they conduct experiments on **SVHN, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet**. They also provide information about how they distort these datasets for their experiments, such as introducing class imbalance and label noise.

In the **experimental setup**, the authors specify that they use the following datasets:
1. **SVHN (Street View House Numbers)**: A dataset for digit recognition.
2. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
3. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes.
4. **ImageNet**: A large dataset for image classification.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2011.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 2015.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
