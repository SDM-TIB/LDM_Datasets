To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Role of Conversation Context for Sarcasm Detection in Online Interactions" by Debanjan Ghosh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors investigate sarcasm detection using conversation context, which suggests that datasets related to social media interactions may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Data section** (Section 2), where the authors describe two datasets used in their research:

1. **Sarcasm Corpus V2**: This dataset is a subset of the Internet Argument Corpus and consists of discussion forum data. It includes sarcastic responses and their context, with a total of 9,400 posts, although only 4,692 posts are available for research. The dataset was annotated through crowdsourcing, where annotators labeled replies as sarcastic if any part of the reply contained sarcasm.

2. **Twitter Dataset**: This dataset was collected to include both sarcastic and non-sarcastic tweets. The authors describe their methodology for collecting tweets, including the use of specific hashtags to identify sarcastic tweets and the exclusion of retweets and duplicates. The final dataset contains 25,991 instances, with 12,215 sarcastic and 13,776 non-sarcastic instances.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Sarcasm Corpus V2**, the citation is:
  > Oraby, S., Harrison, V., Hernandez, E., Reed, L., Riloff, E., & Walker, M. (2016). Creating and characterizing a diverse corpus of sarcasm in dialogue. 

- For the **Twitter Dataset**, the citation is based on the methodology referenced in the paper:
  > Gonz´alez-Ib´a˜nez, R., Muresan, S., & Wacholder, N. (2011). Identifying sarcasm in twitter: A closer look. In ACL (Short Papers). Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 581–586.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
