To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Distributed Deep Reinforcement Learning Technique for Application Placement in Edge and Fog Computing Environments" by Mohammad Goudarzi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments or simulations.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 6 (Performance Evaluation)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using **synthetic DAG datasets** generated with various parameters, which indicates that datasets are indeed utilized.

In the **experimental setup**, the authors detail how they generated different DAG datasets, specifying parameters like the number of tasks (L), fatness (f at), and density. They mention that each dataset contains 100 DAGs with varying configurations, which is crucial information for dataset extraction.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets used. However, since the datasets are synthetic and generated by the authors, they may not have external citations. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper about how these datasets were created.

The key datasets identified are:

1. **Synthetic DAG Datasets**: These datasets are generated with different configurations (e.g., L = 10, 15, 20, etc.) and are used for evaluating the performance of the proposed technique. The authors specify that they created 25 different combinations of parameters resulting in 2500 DAGs.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the details about the datasets and their generation process, as well as any relevant citations if applicable.

Since the datasets are synthetic and generated by the authors, I will note that there are no external citations for these datasets, but I will include the relevant details about their creation as described in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that all necessary information is included for clarity and completeness.
