To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowing your FATE: Friendship, Action and Temporal Explanations for User Engagement Prediction on Social Apps" by Xianfeng Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "two large-scale datasets from Snapchat," which indicates that datasets are indeed present. I will note this and look for specific names in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In this section, they state that they obtained two large-scale datasets from Snapchat, specifically constructed from users in different geographic regions. They mention filtering out inactive users and provide a brief overview of the datasets' characteristics.

I will look for any specific names or identifiers for these datasets. The paper describes the datasets as follows:

1. **Region 1 Dataset**: This dataset includes users from a specific city in North America, with an average of 153,006 users and various features related to user actions on Snapchat.

2. **Region 2 Dataset**: This dataset includes users from a different city in Europe, with an average of 108,452 users and similar features.

Both datasets are constructed over a time period from September 16, 2019, to October 27, 2019, with a one-day time interval.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to these datasets. However, it appears that the datasets are proprietary to Snapchat and may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. Therefore, I will document them based on the information provided in the paper.

The citations for the datasets will be constructed as follows:

- For **Region 1 Dataset**:
  > Tang, X., Liu, Y., Shah, N., Shi, X., Mitra, P., & Wang, S. (2020). Knowing your FATE: Friendship, Action and Temporal Explanations for User Engagement Prediction on Social Apps. In Proceedings of the 26th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD ’20), August 23–27, 2020, Virtual Event, CA, USA. ACM, New York, NY, USA.

- For **Region 2 Dataset**:
  > Tang, X., Liu, Y., Shah, N., Shi, X., Mitra, P., & Wang, S. (2020). Knowing your FATE: Friendship, Action and Temporal Explanations for User Engagement Prediction on Social Apps. In Proceedings of the 26th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD ’20), August 23–27, 2020, Virtual Event, CA, USA. ACM, New York, NY, USA.

Since both datasets are derived from the same study, they will share the same citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the names, descriptions, and citations for each dataset in a structured format for further processing or review.
