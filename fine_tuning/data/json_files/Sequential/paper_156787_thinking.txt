To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Strengthening Structural Inductive Biases by Pre-training to Perform Syntactic Transformations" by Matthias Lindemann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the creation of a dataset for syntactic transformations, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any relevant subsections within the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention constructing a dataset of automatically generated syntactic transformations based on English dependency trees. This suggests that the dataset is central to their methodology.

In the **methodology** section, the authors describe the dataset generation process, which involves tagging, parsing, and lemmatizing 2.1 million sentences from the C4 corpus, resulting in approximately 4.2 million pre-training instances. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

I will also check the **experiments** section to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned for evaluation purposes. The paper references the **ATIS** dataset for semantic parsing tasks, which is another dataset I need to include.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **C4 Dataset**: The authors do not provide a specific citation for the C4 dataset in the paper, but it is widely known in the NLP community. The citation is:
   > Colin Raffel, Noam Shazeer, Adam Roberts, Katherine Lee, Sharan Narang, Michael Matena, Yanqi Zhou, Wei Li, and Peter J Liu. *Exploring the limits of transfer learning with a unified text-to-text transformer*. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 21(140):1â€“67, 2020.

2. **ATIS Dataset**: The citation for the ATIS dataset is:
   > Deborah A. Dahl, Madeleine Bates, Michael Brown, William Fisher, Kate Hunicke-Smith, David Pallett, Christine Pao, Alexander Rudnicky, and Elizabeth Shriberg. *Expanding the scope of the ATIS task: The ATIS-3 corpus*. In Human Language Technology: Proceedings of a Workshop held at Plainsboro, New Jersey, March 8-11, 1994.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
