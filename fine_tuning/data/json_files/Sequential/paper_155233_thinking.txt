To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "On Sensitivity of Deep Learning Based Text Classification Algorithms to Practical Input Perturbations" by Aamir Miyajiwala et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their methods on **four standard benchmark datasets**: SST-2, TREC-6, BBC News, and TweetEval. This gives me a clear starting point for the datasets I need to extract.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, specifically the **3.1 Dataset description** subsection, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of each dataset. Here, I will find the following information:

1. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2)**: This dataset consists of sentences from movie reviews with sentiment annotations. It contains a total of 8,741 samples, with 6,920 for training and 1,821 for testing.

2. **Text Retrieval Conference (TREC-6)**: This dataset includes open-domain, fact-based questions categorized into six classes. It has 5,452 training samples and 500 test samples.

3. **TweetEval**: This dataset is designed for multi-class tweet classification tasks, containing 45,615 sentences in the training set and 12,284 in the test set.

4. **BBC News**: This dataset consists of 2,225 documents from the BBC news website, covering five topical areas.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2)**, the citation is:

- For **TREC-6**, the citation is:

- For **TweetEval**, the citation is:

- For **BBC News**, the citation is:
  > BBC News. (n.d.). *BBC News dataset*. Retrieved from http://mlg.ucd.ie/datasets/bbc.html.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
