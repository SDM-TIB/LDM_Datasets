To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Assessing the Ability of LSTMs to Learn Syntax-Sensitive Dependencies" by Tal Linzen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will pay close attention to the **methodology section**, particularly any subsections that discuss data collection or experimental setup. In this paper, the authors describe a **number prediction task** and mention generating a corpus of training and testing examples based on Wikipedia. This indicates that there is a dataset involved.

In the **data section**, the authors specify that they generated a corpus of approximately **1.35 million number prediction problems** from Wikipedia, with specific splits for training, validation, and testing. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm the use of the dataset and to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned. The authors discuss their results based on the number prediction task, which reinforces the importance of the dataset derived from Wikipedia.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is generated from Wikipedia, I will cite it as follows:

- For the Wikipedia-based dataset, the citation is:
  > Wikipedia contributors. *Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia*. Available at: https://www.wikipedia.org/. Accessed on [insert access date].

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented for future reference or analysis.
