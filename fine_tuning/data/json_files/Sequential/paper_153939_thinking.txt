To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Audio Captioning Using Gated Recurrent Units" by Ays¸eg¨ul ¨Ozkaya Eren and Mustafa Sert, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a "newly published audio captioning performance dataset, namely Clotho," which indicates that a specific dataset is being utilized for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section** where the authors discuss previous works in audio captioning and mention the Clotho dataset again, emphasizing its relevance to their research. This reinforces the idea that Clotho is a key dataset for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, specifically section 3.1, the authors provide detailed information about the Clotho dataset. They mention that it contains 2,893 audio clips for development and 1,043 audio clips for evaluation, with each audio clip having five captions. This section confirms the dataset's structure and its significance in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Clotho dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **Clotho Dataset**:
  > Konstantinos Drossos, Samuel Lipping, and Tuomas Virtanen. "Clotho: an audio captioning dataset." In ICASSP 2020 - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), May 2020.

Additionally, the authors mention the use of the **ProSound Effects dataset** in previous works, but since they do not use it directly in their experiments, I will not include it in my dataset extraction.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry for Clotho, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
