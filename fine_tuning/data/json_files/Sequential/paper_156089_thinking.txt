To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lucy-SKG: Learning to Play Rocket League Efficiently Using Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Vasileios Moschopoulos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly list datasets, it may hint at their use. The introduction often discusses the context and related work, which might include references to datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly any subsections that discuss experimental setups or data collection. This section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using **RLGym**, a framework for developing Rocket League bots, which suggests that the dataset is related to gameplay data from Rocket League. I will also check for any references to specific datasets or benchmarks that may have been used in conjunction with RLGym.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the paper references the RLGym framework, I would look for its citation in the references:

- **RLGym**: 
  > Lucas Emery. *Rocket League Gym*. Available at: https://github.com/lucas-emery/rocket-league-gym, 2022.

If there are any other datasets mentioned, I will follow the same process to find their full citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and citations, into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that all relevant datasets are documented accurately and comprehensively.
