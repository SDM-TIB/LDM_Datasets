To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Severe Occlusion: Multi-Person 3D Pose Estimation with Gated Convolution" by Renshu Gu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the collection of a new dataset called the **moving camera multi-human (MMHuman) dataset**, which is specifically designed for multi-person 3D pose estimation with occlusion handling. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look into **Section III (The Moving Camera Multi-Human Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the MMHuman dataset. Here, I will note the key characteristics of the dataset, such as the types of actions included, the number of videos, and the total number of frames. The dataset is described as containing various human interactions and occlusions, captured using a motion capture system and additional mobile cameras.

In addition to the MMHuman dataset, I will also check **Section V (Experimental Setup and Results)**, where the authors mention that they evaluate their method on the **Human3.6M dataset**. This is a well-known dataset in the field of 3D human pose estimation, and it is important to include it in my extraction.

Now, I will gather the full citations for both datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For the **MMHuman dataset**, since it is a new dataset introduced by the authors, I will cite it as follows:
   > Gu, R., Wang, G., & Hwang, J.-N. (2023). *Exploring Severe Occlusion: Multi-Person 3D Pose Estimation with Gated Convolution*. [Dataset]. 

2. For the **Human3.6M dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ionescu, C., Papava, D., Olaru, V., & Sminchisescu, C. (2014). *Human3.6M: Large scale datasets and predictive methods for 3D human sensing in natural environments*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 36(7), 1325-1339.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **MMHuman Dataset**: A new dataset aimed at multi-person 3D pose estimation with occlusion handling, featuring various actions and interactions captured by moving cameras.
- **Human3.6M Dataset**: A large-scale dataset featuring a single person at the center of videos recorded by a motion capture system.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that all citations are accurately represented.
