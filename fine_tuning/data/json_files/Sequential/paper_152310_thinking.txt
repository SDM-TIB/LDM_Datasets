To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detection and Tracking of Liquids with Fully Convolutional Networks" by Connor Schenck and Dieter Fox, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors generated a dataset with over 4.5 million labeled images for training and testing their models. This suggests that a significant dataset is involved, but I need to gather more details.

Next, I will examine **section III (Methodology)**, specifically the subsection titled **Data Generation**. Here, the authors describe how they created a dataset using a 3D modeling application called Blender and a liquid simulation library named El’Beem. They mention generating a total of 4,554,900 training images from 10,122 pouring sequences, which is a crucial dataset for their experiments.

I will also look for any specific names or identifiers for the dataset. The authors refer to their dataset as a "large dataset of labeled images" but do not provide a specific name. However, they do mention that this dataset is the first dedicated to perceiving and reasoning about liquids directly from raw sensory data generated via realistic simulation.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** for any relevant sources that describe the tools used to create the dataset. The references to **Blender** and **El’Beem** are important:

1. **Blender**: 
   > Blender Online Community. Blender - A 3D modelling and rendering package. Blender Foundation, Blender Institute, Amsterdam, 2016. URL http://www.blender.org.

2. **El’Beem**: The paper does not provide a specific citation for El’Beem, but I will note that it is based on the lattice-Boltzmann method for liquid simulations, as mentioned in the text.

Since the dataset does not have a formal name or citation, I will summarize it as follows:

- **Liquid Perception Dataset**: A dataset generated using Blender and El’Beem, containing over 4.5 million labeled images for training and testing liquid detection and tracking models.

Now, I will compile the dataset information, including the citations for the tools used to create the dataset, into a structured format for further processing or review.
