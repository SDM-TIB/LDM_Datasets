To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combining Intra-Risk and Contagion Risk for Enterprise Bankruptcy Prediction Using Graph Neural Networks" by Yu Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the creation of a novel benchmark dataset called **SMEsD**, which is a strong indication that a dataset is present.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the importance of predicting bankruptcy risk for SMEs and highlight the lack of publicly available datasets in this area. They mention that they collected real-world multi-source data on SMEs, which leads me to believe that SMEsD is the primary dataset used in their research.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide detailed statistics about the SMEsD dataset, including the number of SMEs, related persons, and various attributes. This section confirms that SMEsD is indeed the dataset used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the SMEsD dataset. However, since SMEsD is a newly constructed dataset by the authors, it may not have a separate citation in the references. Instead, I will note that the dataset is described in detail within the paper itself.

The relevant details about the SMEsD dataset are as follows:
- **SMEsD**: A dataset containing information on 3,976 SMEs and related persons in China from 2014 to 2021, including basic business information and lawsuit events spanning from 2000 to 2021.

Since the dataset is created by the authors and described in the paper, I will format the citation as follows:
> Zhao, Y., Wei, S., Guo, Y., Yang, Q., Chen, X., Li, Q., Zhuang, F., Liu, J., & Kou, G. (2022). Combining Intra-Risk and Contagion Risk for Enterprise Bankruptcy Prediction Using Graph Neural Networks. *Journal Name*, *Volume*(Issue), Page Range. DOI or URL if available.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for SMEsD, ensuring that I include all relevant details and the citation in the appropriate format. This will allow for easy reference and verification in future research or applications.
