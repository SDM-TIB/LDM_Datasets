To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Edge Deep Learning for Neural Implants: A Case Study of Seizure Detection and Prediction" by Xilin Liu and Andrew G. Richardson, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their models using the **CHB-MIT scalp EEG database**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Methods** or **Datasets** section, which is likely to provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this paper, the **Methods** section includes a subsection titled **Data Preparation**, where the authors describe the **CHB-MIT scalp EEG database** in detail. They mention that this database is publicly available at PhysioNet.org and contains recordings from 23 pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy. This is crucial information for my dataset extraction.

I will also check the **References** section to find the full citation for the **CHB-MIT database**. The paper cites the database as follows:
> Shoeb A H. *Application of machine learning to epileptic seizure onset detection and treatment*. Ph.D. thesis Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2009.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **CHB-MIT scalp EEG database**: This dataset is used for benchmarking seizure detection algorithms and contains recordings from pediatric patients with epilepsy. It is publicly available and widely used in the field.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details for future reference or processing.
