To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Timescale Modeling of Human Behavior" by Chinmai Basavaraj et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it discusses the use of data collected in a simulated urban search and rescue scenario, it does not specify any dataset names.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the importance of AI in understanding and predicting human behavior. They mention the use of a Minecraft-based testbed developed as part of DARPA's ASIST program, which suggests that this testbed may be a dataset of interest.

In the **experiment section**, the authors describe the data collected from 115 teams engaged in the simulated USAR mission in Minecraft. They mention that the data was segmented into two-minute sliding windows, resulting in approximately 21,000 data points. This indicates that the dataset is derived from the ASIST Study 3, which is crucial for my extraction.

I will now look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The relevant citation for the dataset used in this research is:

- **ASIST Study 3 Dataset**: 
  > Huang, L., Freeman, J., Cooke, N., Colonna-Romano, J., Wood, M. D., Buchanan, V., & Caufman, S. J. (2022). Exercises for Artificial Social Intelligence in Minecraft Search and Rescue for Teams.

Additionally, I will note that the paper references the Minecraft-based testbed developed under the DARPA ASIST program, which is a significant aspect of the dataset but does not have a separate citation since it is part of the ASIST Study.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that full citations are included for proper attribution. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
