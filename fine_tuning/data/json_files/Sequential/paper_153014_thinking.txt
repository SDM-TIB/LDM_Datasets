To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leap-LSTM: Enhancing Long Short-Term Memory for Text Categorization" by Ting Huang, Gehui Shen, and Zhi-Hong Deng, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their model on "several text categorization tasks" with "five benchmark data sets." This suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant sections that might provide more information. In this case, I find that **section 4.1 (Data)** explicitly lists the datasets used in their experiments.

The paper mentions five datasets:
1. **AGNews**: A news categorization dataset with 4 classes, containing 12,000 training samples and 70,000 test samples.
2. **DBPedia**: An ontology classification dataset with 14 classes, containing 7,600 training samples and 70,000 test samples.
3. **Yelp Full**: A sentiment analysis dataset with 5 classes, containing 560,000 training samples and 50,000 test samples.
4. **Yelp Polarity**: Another sentiment analysis dataset with 2 classes, containing 650,000 training samples and 38,000 test samples.
5. **Yahoo Answers**: A topic classification dataset with 10 classes, containing 1,400,000 training samples and 60,000 test samples.

To ensure accuracy, I will cross-reference these datasets with the **experiments section** to confirm that they were indeed used for evaluation. The authors state that they used these five datasets for their experiments, which confirms their relevance.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section**. The paper cites the source of these datasets as follows:

- For **AGNews**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, X., Zhao, J. J., & LeCun, Y. (2015). Character-level convolutional networks for text classification. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 649-657.

- For **DBPedia**, the citation is:
  > Lehmann, J., Iannone, L., & Auer, S. (2015). DBpedia - A large-scale, multilingual knowledge base extracted from Wikipedia. In Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), 721-726.

- For **Yelp Full** and **Yelp Polarity**, the citation is:

- For **Yahoo Answers**, the citation is:
  > Yang, Y., & Liu, X. (2006). A re-examination of text categorization methods. In Proceedings of the 29th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, 42-49.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
