To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Time-Warping Invariant Quantum Recurrent Neural Networks via Quantum-Classical Adaptive Gating" by Ivana Nikoloska et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments in section 5, where they mention tasks such as "Remembering a Cosine Wave" and "Predicting Spin Dynamics." I will check if they refer to any datasets used for these tasks. If they do, I will note the names and descriptions of these datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source information for anyone who may want to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "Penn Action Dataset" or "JHMDB Dataset," I will look for the corresponding citations in the references to ensure I have the complete bibliographic information.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further, while ensuring that the citations are complete and correctly formatted.
