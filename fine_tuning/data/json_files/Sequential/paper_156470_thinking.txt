To extract datasets from the research paper titled "L3Cube-MahaSocialNER: A Social Media based Marathi NER Dataset and BERT models" by Harsh Chaudhari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of the **L3Cube-MahaSocialNER dataset**, which is specifically designed for Named Entity Recognition (NER) in the Marathi language. This indicates that the dataset is central to the paper's contributions.

Next, I will look into **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors elaborate on the significance of NER and the challenges posed by social media data. They emphasize the need for high-quality datasets tailored for low-resource languages like Marathi, which reinforces the importance of the **L3Cube-MahaSocialNER dataset**.

Moving on to **section 3 (Compilation of Dataset)**, I will find detailed information about the dataset's structure. The authors describe the dataset as comprising **18,000 manually labeled sentences** across **eight entity classes**. They also provide statistics on the dataset's partitions: **12,114 sentences for training**, **2,250 for testing**, and **1,500 for validation**. This section is crucial as it provides the quantitative details necessary for understanding the dataset's scope.

In addition, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **L3Cube-MahaSocialNER dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Harsh Chaudhari, Anuja Patil, Dhanashree Lavekar, Pranav Khairnar, and Raviraj Joshi. 2024. L3Cube-MahaSocialNER: A Social Media based Marathi NER Dataset and BERT models. In Proceedings of ACM Conference (Conference’17). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 9 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/nnnnnnn.nnnnnnn

Since the paper also references the **L3CubeMahaSent Marathi Sentiment Analysis dataset**, I will note that this dataset is mentioned as the source of the original sentences for the L3Cube-MahaSocialNER dataset. I will look for its citation as well:
> Atharva Kulkarni, Meet Mandhane, Manali Likhitkar, Gayatri Kshirsagar, and Raviraj Joshi. 2021. L3CubeMahaSent: A Marathi Tweet-based Sentiment Analysis Dataset. In Proceedings of the Eleventh Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis. Association for Computational Linguistics, Online, 213–220. https://aclanthology.org/2021.wassa-1.23

Now, I will compile the extracted dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citations for both datasets. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets discussed in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
