To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reconstruction Bottlenecks in Object-Centric Generative Models" by Martin Engelcke et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the experiments section is likely to contain specific dataset names and details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of applying object-centric generative models to complex datasets, which suggests that they may reference specific datasets later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In **subsection 4.1**, they list three datasets:

1. **Multi-dSprites**: This dataset is referenced as being used in their experiments and is associated with the work of Burgess et al. (2019).
2. **ShapeStacks**: This dataset is mentioned as well, with a citation to Groth et al. (2018).
3. **ObjectsRoom**: The authors refer to this dataset and cite Kabra et al. (2019).

I will then verify the details of these datasets in the **References section** to ensure I have the correct full citations:

- For **Multi-dSprites**, the citation is:
  > Burgess, C. P., Matthey, L., Watters, N., Kabra, R., Higgins, I., Botvinick, M., and Lerchner, A. *MONet: Unsupervised Scene Decomposition and Representation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.11390, 2019.

- For **ShapeStacks**, the citation is:
  > Groth, O., Fuchs, F. B., Posner, I., and Vedaldi, A. *ShapeStacks: Learning Vision-Based Physical Intuition for Generalised Object Stacking*. European Conference on Computer Vision, 2018.

- For **ObjectsRoom**, the citation is:
  > Kabra, R., Burgess, C., Matthey, L., Kaufman, R. L., Greff, K., Reynolds, M., and Lerchner, A. *Multi-Object Datasets*. https://github.com/deepmind/multi-object-datasets/, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
