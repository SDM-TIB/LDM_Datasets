To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Novel Speech-Driven Lip-Sync Model with CNN and LSTM" by Xiaohong Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a new speech-animation dataset to address the lack of public data for training speech-driven 3D facial animation models. This suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Method)**, particularly the subsection titled **Dataset Generation**. Here, the authors describe the process of creating their dataset. They mention using the **THCHS-30 corpus**, which is an open Chinese speech database, as the speech script for their recordings. They recorded a male character speaking Mandarin, capturing synchronized video and audio data.

In this section, the authors provide details about the dataset they generated, including the duration of the recordings (four hours) and the number of sentences (1000) covered in the dataset. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and purpose.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the THCHS-30 corpus. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For **THCHS-30 corpus**, the citation is:
  > Wang, D. and Zhang, X. (2015). *THCHS-30: A free Chinese speech corpus*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.01882.

Since the authors created their own dataset based on the THCHS-30 corpus, I will also note that the dataset they generated does not have a formal citation since it is original work. However, I will describe it as a new dataset created for the purpose of their research.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the THCHS-30 corpus and a description of the newly created dataset.

After completing these steps, I will be ready to present the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
