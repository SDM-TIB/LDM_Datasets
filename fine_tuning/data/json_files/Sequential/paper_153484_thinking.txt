To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-to-End ASR: From Supervised to Semi-Supervised Learning with Modern Architectures" by Gabriel Synnaeve et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of the **LIBRISPEECH dataset** and additional unlabeled data from **LIBRIVOX**, which indicates that these are key datasets for the research.

Next, I will examine the **section 3 (Dataset and Language Models for Pseudo-Labeling)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, I find:

1. **LIBRISPEECH**: This is a well-known dataset for automatic speech recognition (ASR) that consists of approximately 1,000 hours of English speech derived from audiobooks. It is commonly used as a benchmark in ASR research.

2. **LIBRIVOX**: This dataset is a collection of freely available audiobooks, which the authors utilized for pseudo-labeling. They mention that they selected 72K hours of read speech from English book listings, which were then processed to create a usable dataset for their experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **LIBRISPEECH**, the citation is:
  > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206â€“5210, 2015.

- For **LIBRIVOX**, while the paper does not provide a formal citation, I can reference the website where the dataset is hosted:
  > LibriVox. *LibriVox: Free public domain audiobooks*. Available at: https://librivox.org.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that I provide a clear and accurate representation of each dataset used in the research. This will be crucial for anyone looking to replicate the study or understand the data sources utilized in the experiments.
