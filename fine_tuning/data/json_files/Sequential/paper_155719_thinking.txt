To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep LSTM Spoken Term Detection using Wav2Vec 2.0 Recognizer" by Jan Švec et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a method evaluated on a large set of spoken documents, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Dataset & model description)**, where the authors explicitly discuss the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention the **USC-SFI MALACH archive** for both English and Czech languages. This section provides essential details about the datasets, including their purpose and the context in which they were used.

The paper cites two specific datasets from the MALACH archive:

1. **MALACH English Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the paper as being used for training and evaluation of the proposed method. The citation for this dataset is:
   > B. Ramabhadran, S. Gustman, W. Byrne, J. Hajič, D. Oard, J. S. Olsson, M. Picheny, and J. Psutka, “USC-SFI MALACH Interviews and Transcripts English LDC2012S05,” 2012. [Online]. Available: https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2012s05

2. **MALACH Czech Dataset**: Similarly, this dataset is also utilized in the experiments. The citation for this dataset is:
   > J. Psutka, V. Radová, P. Ircing, J. Matoušek, and L. Müller, “USC-SFI MALACH Interviews and Transcripts Czech LDC2014S04,” 2014. [Online]. Available: https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2014S04

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details about each dataset, including their names, descriptions, and full citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing, ensuring that the citations are complete and correctly formatted.
