To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variable-lag Granger Causality for Time Series Analysis" by Chainarong Amornbunchornvej et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for validation or testing. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the **subsection on datasets**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and the context in which they were used.

In this paper, the authors mention two datasets in the **Experiments section**:

1. **Schools of Fish Dataset**: This dataset consists of two-dimensional time series of fish movement recorded by video, specifically focusing on the behavior of golden shiners (Notemigonus crysoleucas). The dataset includes 24 coordination events with around 600 time steps of movement data.

2. **Troop of Baboons Dataset**: This dataset includes GPS tracking information from 26 members of a troop of olive baboons (Papio anubis), recorded at 1 Hz over a period of 10 days. The analysis focuses on a specific coordinated event involving 16 baboons.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Schools of Fish Dataset**, the citation is:
> A. Strandburg-Peshkin et al. "Visual sensory networks and effective information transfer in animal groups." *Current Biology*, vol. 23, no. 17, pp. R709–R711, 2013.

For the **Troop of Baboons Dataset**, the citation is:
> A. Strandburg-Peshkin et al. "Shared decision-making drives collective movement in wild baboons." *Science*, vol. 348, no. 6241, pp. 1358–1361, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
