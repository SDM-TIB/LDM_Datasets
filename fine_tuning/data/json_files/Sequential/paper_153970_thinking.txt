To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Few-shot Neural Architecture Search" by Yiyang Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on various applications, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their evaluation methods. In this section, they mention using two specific datasets for their experiments:

1. **NasBench-201**: This is a public architecture dataset that provides a unified benchmark for neural architecture search algorithms. It contains information about all 15,625 architectures in the search space, including metrics like size, training and test time, and accuracy on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-16-120.

2. **NasBench1-shot-1**: This dataset supports one-shot NAS algorithms and is based on NasBench-101. It allows for quick evaluations of architectures without the need for extensive training.

In the experiments, the authors detail how they utilized these datasets to evaluate the performance of their proposed few-shot NAS method against existing algorithms.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **NasBench-201**, the citation is:
  > Dong, X., & Yang, Y. (2020). Nas-bench-201: Extending the scope of reproducible neural architecture search. In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR). URL: https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJxyZkBKDr.

- For **NasBench1-shot-1**, the citation is:
  > Zela, A., Siems, J., & Hutter, F. (2020). Nas-bench-1shot1: Benchmarking and dissecting one-shot neural architecture search. In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR). URL: https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx9ngStPH.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured for future reference or processing.
