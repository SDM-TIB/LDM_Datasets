To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Weakly-Supervised Representation Learning for Video Alignment and Analysis" by Guy Bar-Shalom et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method achieves superior performance on various downstream video analysis applications, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Empirical Study)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they describe two datasets:

1. **PennAction Dataset**: This dataset includes videos of humans performing various sports and exercise activities. The authors specify that it contains a total of 1140 videos for training and 966 for testing, with each action set containing between 40 to 134 training videos and 42 to 116 test videos.

2. **Pouring Dataset**: This dataset consists of videos showing the process of a hand pouring a liquid from one object to another. The authors mention that it includes 70 videos for training and 14 for testing, with phase labels based on the TCC method, consisting of five classes.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **PennAction Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, W., Zhu, M., & Derpanis, K. G. (2013). From actemes to action: A strongly-supervised representation for detailed action understanding. In *Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)*, 2248–2255.

- For the **Pouring Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sermanet, P., Lynch, C., Chebotar, Y., Hsu, J., Jang, E., Schaal, S., et al. (2018). Time-contrastive networks: Self-supervised learning from video. In *2018 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)*, 1134–1141.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
