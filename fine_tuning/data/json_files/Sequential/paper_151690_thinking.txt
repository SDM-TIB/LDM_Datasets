To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Generating Image Sequence from Description with LSTM Conditional GAN" by Xu Ouyang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that their model is trained on the **Oxford-102 Flowers** and **Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to gather more details about these datasets. In the experiments section, the authors provide specific information about both datasets:

1. **Oxford-102 Flowers Dataset**: This dataset contains 8,189 images of flowers from 102 different categories. Each image is accompanied by 10 descriptions.

2. **Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 11,788 bird images divided into 200 categories. Similar to the flowers dataset, each image has 10 descriptions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Oxford-102 Flowers Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M.-E. Nilsback and A. Zisserman. *Automated flower classification over a large number of classes*. In Proceedings of the Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics and Image Processing, Dec 2008.

- For the **Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. Wah, S. Branson, P. Welinder, P. Perona, and S. Belongie. *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*. Technical Report CNS-TR-2011-001, California Institute of Technology, 2011.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
