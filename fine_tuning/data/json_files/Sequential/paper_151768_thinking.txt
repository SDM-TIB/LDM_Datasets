To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Compact Recurrent Neural Networks with Block-Term Tensor Decomposition" by Jinmian Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on three challenging tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors describe the tasks they performed. In this section, they mention using the **UCF11 dataset** for action recognition in videos. This dataset is explicitly named, and I will gather more details about it.

In the **experiments subsection (4.2)**, the authors provide a brief description of the UCF11 dataset, stating that it contains 1600 video clips across 11 action categories. This information is crucial for my dataset entry.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the UCF11 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Liu, J., Luo, W., & Shah, M. (2009). Recognizing realistic actions from videos in the wild. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1996â€“2003.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the steps I took include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction to identify potential datasets.
2. Focusing on the experiments section to find explicit mentions of datasets.
3. Gathering details about the UCF11 dataset.
4. Retrieving the full citation from the references section.

With this information, I am ready to create a structured output for the dataset identified in the paper.
