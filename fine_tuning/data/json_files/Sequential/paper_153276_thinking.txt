To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Corpus-free State2Seq User Simulator for Task-oriented Dialogue" by Yutai Hou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on an open dataset, which indicates that there are datasets involved. I will look for specific names and descriptions of these datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of training dialogue systems due to the lack of annotated dialogue corpora. They mention user simulators and the need for diverse dialogue data, which suggests that datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. They state that they used two datasets: 

1. **Movie Ticket Booking Dataset**: This dataset is described as an open task-completion dialogue dataset that includes various dialogue acts, slots, and user goal templates. It is used to gather information about customer desires and assess the success of dialogues based on whether a movie is booked.

2. **Restaurant Reservation Dataset**: This dataset is built for the restaurant domain, where users reserve tables based on their requirements. It includes dialogue acts, slots, and user goal templates similar to the movie dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

- For the **Movie Ticket Booking Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li, X., Chen, Y.N., Li, L., Gao, J. (2017). *End-to-End Task-Completion Neural Dialogue Systems*. In Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP).

- For the **Restaurant Reservation Dataset**, the authors mention that it is based on the templates from the Movie Ticket Booking Dataset, but since it is an in-house dataset, it may not have a formal citation. However, I will note that it is derived from the work cited above.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
