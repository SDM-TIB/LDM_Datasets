To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Generation of Handwritten Text Images Conditioned on Sequences" by Eloi Alonso et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the study. The abstract mentions that the authors obtained realistic images on both French and Arabic datasets, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets in detail. In this paper, the **experimental setup** section (III) provides a summary of the datasets used, specifically in **Table I**, which outlines the characteristics of the RIMES and OpenHaRT datasets.

From the table, I can extract the following details:

1. **RIMES Dataset**: This dataset is used for handwritten text recognition in French. It consists of 6,780 images and 129,414 words, with a total of 86 unique characters.

2. **OpenHaRT Dataset**: This dataset is used for handwritten text recognition in Arabic. It contains 65,575 images and 710,892 words, with a total of 77 unique characters.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the RIMES dataset as follows:

- For the **RIMES Dataset**:
  > E. Grosicki and H. El Abed. *ICDAR 2009 handwriting recognition competition*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), 2009.

And for the **OpenHaRT Dataset**:
- For the **OpenHaRT Dataset**:
  > T. Bluche and R. Messina. *Gated Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks for Multilingual Handwriting Recognition*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), 2017.

With these citations, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all relevant information is accurately captured.
