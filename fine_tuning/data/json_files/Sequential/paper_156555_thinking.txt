To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Verif.ai: Towards an Open-Source Scientific Generative Question-Answering System with Referenced and Verifiable Answers" by Miloš Košprdić et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a fine-tuned generative model and references to scientific papers, which suggests that datasets related to question-answering and information retrieval may be present.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors discuss the components of their system. In subsection B, titled "Question-answering with references," the authors mention using the **PubMedQA dataset** for fine-tuning their generative model. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also check the **evaluation section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or used for testing the models. The authors reference the **SciFact dataset** in the context of verifying claims and hallucination detection, which is another dataset of interest.

Now, I will gather full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **PubMedQA Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Jin Q, Dhingra B, Liu Z, Cohen WW, Lu X. *Pubmedqa: A dataset for biomedical research question answering*. arXiv preprint arXiv:190906146. 2019.

2. **SciFact Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Wadden D, Lin S, Lo K, Wang LL, van Zuylen M, Cohan A, et al. *Fact or fiction: Verifying scientific claims*. arXiv preprint arXiv:200414974. 2020.

After collecting the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for further processing or review.
