To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Evolved Transformer" by David R. So et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluated their method on several well-established language tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they mention the following datasets:

1. **WMT English-German**: The authors state that they used the WMT’18 En-De training data, which consists of 4.5 million sentence pairs. They also specify the validation and test sets used for this dataset.

2. **WMT English-French**: Similar to the previous dataset, they replicate the setup from Vaswani et al. (2017) and use 36 million sentence pairs for training, with specific validation and test sets.

3. **WMT English-Czech**: The authors mention using the WMT’18 training dataset for this language pair, along with the corresponding validation and test sets.

4. **1 Billion Word Language Model Benchmark (LM1B)**: This dataset is used for language modeling tasks, and the authors note that they utilized its Tensor2Tensor implementation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are as follows:

- For **WMT English-German**:
  > Vaswani, A., Shazeer, N., Parmar, N., Uszkoreit, J., Jones, L., Gomez, A. N., Kaiser, L., and Polosukhin, I. *Attention is all you need*. In Neural Information Processing Systems, 2017.

- For **WMT English-French**:
  > Vaswani, A., Shazeer, N., Parmar, N., Uszkoreit, J., Jones, L., Gomez, A. N., Kaiser, L., and Polosukhin, I. *Attention is all you need*. In Neural Information Processing Systems, 2017.

- For **WMT English-Czech**:
  > Vaswani, A., Shazeer, N., Parmar, N., Uszkoreit, J., Jones, L., Gomez, A. N., Kaiser, L., and Polosukhin, I. *Attention is all you need*. In Neural Information Processing Systems, 2017.

- For **1 Billion Word Language Model Benchmark (LM1B)**:
  > Chelba, C., Mikolov, T., Schuster, M., Ge, Q., Brants, T., and Koehn, P. *One billion word benchmark for measuring progress in statistical language modeling*. CoRR, abs/1312.3005, 2013.

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
