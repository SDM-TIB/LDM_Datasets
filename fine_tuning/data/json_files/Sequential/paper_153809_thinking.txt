To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Kvistur 2.0: a BiLSTM Compound Splitter for Icelandic" by Jón Friðrik Daðason et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the model is trained on a dataset of 2.9 million unique word forms from the Database of Icelandic Morphology (DIM), which suggests that this is a significant dataset.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Setup)**, specifically **subsection 5.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **MorphIce Dataset**: This dataset is intended for inclusion in MorphIce, a morphological database containing the constituent structures of approximately 2.9 million unique word forms, of which 2.5 million are compounds. This dataset is crucial for training the BiLSTM model.

2. **GermaNet Dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately 75,000 compound words from GermaNet, which have been manually annotated to indicate where binary splits occur. This dataset is used for evaluating the model's performance on German compound words.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MorphIce Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bjarnadóttir, K., Hlynsdóttir, K. I., and Steingrímsson, S. (2019). DIM: The Database of Icelandic Morphology. In Proceedings of the 22nd Nordic Conference on Computational Linguistics, NODALIDA 2019, Turku, Finland.

- For the **GermaNet Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Henrich, V. and Hinrichs, E. (2010). GernEdiT - the GermaNet editing tool. In Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation, LREC 2010, Valletta, Malta.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective references.
