To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fused Deep Neural Network based Transfer Learning in Occluded Face Classification and Person re-Identification" by Mohamed Mohana et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected data from Google Images and fieldwork, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Proposed methodology)**, particularly **subsection 3.1 (Dataset Collection and Preprocessing)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for classification and person identification. Here, they mention two categories of datasets:

1. **Classification Dataset**: This dataset includes images of occluded faces collected from Google Images, manually labeled for training the model. The dataset consists of various types of occlusions, including medical masks, scarves, hands, and objects.

2. **Person Identification Dataset**: This dataset is composed of individual images collected for specific persons, organized into subfolders based on the type of occlusion. Each subfolder contains 50 images, leading to a balanced dataset for each occlusion type.

In **subsection 3.1**, the authors provide details about the number of images for each type of occlusion, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's composition.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to publicly available datasets, including one from Kaggle and another from a source labeled as [36]. 

For the **Kaggle dataset**, I will look for the specific title or link in the Kaggle repository to provide a proper citation. For the dataset referenced as [36], I will extract the full citation from the references provided in the paper.

The citation for the dataset mentioned as [36] is:
> Zhongyuan Wang, Guangcheng Wang, Baojin Huang, Zhangyang Xiong, Qi Hong, Hao Wu, Peng Yi, Kui Jiang, Nanxi Wang, Yingjiao Pei, Heling Chen, Yu Miao, Zhibing Huang, Jinbi Liang. *Masked face recognition dataset and application*. 2020.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
