To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dual-CLVSA: a Novel Deep Learning Approach to Predict Financial Markets with Sentiment Measurements" by Jia Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their approach using historical trading data and sentiment measurements, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the use of sentiment data from Thomson Reuters MarketPsych Indices (TRMI) and historical trading data of SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (SPY). This section provides a clear indication of the datasets being utilized.

In the **methodology section**, the authors outline their experimental plan, which includes using two specific datasets:
1. **Historical trading records of SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (SPY)**: This dataset includes attributes such as date, time, open price, high price, low price, close price, and trading volume.
2. **Thomson Reuters MarketPsych Indices (TRMI)**: This dataset consists of sentiment features like buzz, sentiment, optimism, fear, and joy, derived from news and social media.

The **experimental setup** section further confirms the use of these datasets, detailing how they are processed and aligned for analysis.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Thomson Reuters MarketPsych Indices (TRMI)**, the citation is:
  > Richard L. Peterson. *Trading on sentiment: The power of minds over markets*. John Wiley & Sons, 2016.

- For **SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (SPY)**, while the dataset itself may not have a formal citation, it is commonly referenced in financial literature. A typical reference could be:
  > State Street Global Advisors. *SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)*. Available at: https://www.spdrs.com.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
