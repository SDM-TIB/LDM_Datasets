To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Wavenet Generation Algorithm" by Tom Le Paine et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced or utilized in the research. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methodology sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the Wavenet model and its applications in audio generation but do not explicitly mention any datasets. I will continue to the **methodology** section to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. If the authors conducted experiments, they might have used specific datasets for training or evaluation purposes. However, in this paper, there is no explicit section detailing datasets used for experiments.

Since the paper does not mention any datasets directly, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through other works. The references include foundational papers on Wavenet and recurrent neural networks, but they do not provide specific datasets.

Given that no datasets are explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will conclude that this research does not utilize any publicly available datasets that need to be cited. 

In summary, I will note that while the paper discusses the Fast Wavenet algorithm and its implications for audio generation, it does not provide specific datasets for evaluation or experimentation. Therefore, there are no dataset entries to compile or cite from this paper.
