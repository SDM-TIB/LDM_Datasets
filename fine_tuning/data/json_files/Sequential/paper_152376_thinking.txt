To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convolutional LSTM Network: A Machine Learning Approach for Precipitation Nowcasting" by Xingjian Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will look for specific names and descriptions of datasets.

In **section 4.1 (Moving-MNIST Dataset)**, the authors describe a synthetic dataset generated from the MNIST dataset, which consists of sequences of moving handwritten digits. The details include:
- **Dataset Name**: Moving-MNIST Dataset
- **Description**: Contains 10,000 training sequences, 2,000 validation sequences, and 3,000 testing sequences, each 20 frames long, generated by moving two digits within a 64x64 frame.

In **section 4.2 (Radar Echo Dataset)**, the authors describe a new radar echo dataset created for their precipitation nowcasting model. The details include:
- **Dataset Name**: Radar Echo Dataset
- **Description**: A subset of three years of weather radar intensities collected in Hong Kong, specifically from the top 97 rainy days. It contains 8148 training sequences, 2037 testing sequences, and 2037 validation sequences, each 20 frames long.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The Moving-MNIST dataset is derived from the original MNIST dataset, which is widely cited. The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

For the Radar Echo Dataset, since it is a new dataset created by the authors, I will cite the paper itself as the source:
> Xingjian Shi, Zhourong Chen, Hao Wang, Dit-Yan Yeung, Wai-kin Wong, and Wang-chun Woo. *Convolutional LSTM Network: A Machine Learning Approach for Precipitation Nowcasting*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately and can be used for future reference or analysis.
