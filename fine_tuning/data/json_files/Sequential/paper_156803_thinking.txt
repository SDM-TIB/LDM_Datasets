To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparison Analysis on Statistical Phrase Alignment, LLM In-Context Learning, and Inter-Methodological Approach" by Sojung Lucia Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and corpus sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study compares methods for translating ancient texts, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to these translations.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the "Annals of the Joseon Dynasty" as a significant historical text. This is a strong indication that this text serves as the primary dataset for their analysis.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Corpus)**, specifically **subsection 2.1 (The Annals of the Joseon Dynasty)**. Here, the authors describe the dataset in detail, stating that it consists of the original texts of the Annals, which were collected through web scraping from the National Institute of Korean History. They mention that the dataset comprises approximately 64 million characters and includes 252,773 records, which is crucial information for dataset extraction.

The authors also provide a link to the source of the dataset, which is the National Institute of Korean History. This is important for citation purposes.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper mentions that the Annals were translated by the Foundation for the Translation of Korean Classics and are publicly available through the National Institute of Korean History. However, I need to ensure that I have the correct citation format.

The citation for the dataset is as follows:
> Foundation for the Translation of Korean Classics. *The Annals of the Joseon Dynasty (Joseon Wangjo Sillok)*. National Institute of Korean History. Available at: https://sillok.history.go.kr/

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for proper referencing.
