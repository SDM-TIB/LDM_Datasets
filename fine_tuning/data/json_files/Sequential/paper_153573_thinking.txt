To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FasterSeg: Searching for Faster Real-Time Semantic Segmentation" by Wuyang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In **section 4.1 (Datasets and Implementations)**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they used the **Cityscapes dataset** as a testbed for architecture search and ablation studies, and they also report results on **CamVid** and **BDD** datasets. This section is crucial as it provides the names of the datasets and their purposes in the research.

Next, I will gather detailed descriptions of each dataset from the text. The authors provide specific information about each dataset:

1. **Cityscapes**: This dataset is described as containing high-quality pixel-level annotations for urban street scenes, with 2,975 images for training and 500 for validation. The images have a resolution of 1024 × 2048 pixels.

2. **CamVid**: This dataset consists of 701 images extracted from five video sequences taken from a driving automobile, with 367 images for training, 101 for validation, and 233 for testing. The images have a resolution of 720 × 960 pixels.

3. **BDD (Berkeley Deep Drive)**: This dataset contains 7,000 images for training and 1,000 for validation, with a resolution of 720 × 1280 pixels. It shares the same 19 semantic categories as the Cityscapes dataset.

Now, I will look in the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The citations I find are:

- For **Cityscapes**:
  > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 3213–3223, 2016.

- For **CamVid**:
  > Gabriel J Brostow, Jamie Shotton, Julien Fauqueur, and Roberto Cipolla. *Segmentation and Recognition Using Structure from Motion Point Clouds*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 44–57, 2008.

- For **BDD**:
  > Fisher Yu, Vladlen Koltun, and Thomas Funkhouser. *BDD100K: A Diverse Driving Video Database with Scalable Annotation Tooling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.04687, 2018.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets and their citations clearly. I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
