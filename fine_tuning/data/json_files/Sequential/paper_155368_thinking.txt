To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Industrial Style Transfer with Large-scale Geometric Warping and Content Preservation" by Jinchao Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method and hints at the datasets used for evaluation. In the introduction, the authors discuss the challenges in visual product design and the role of datasets in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their research. In this section, they mention that the datasets consist of source and target products, as well as art style images. Specifically, they state that the source products are selected from the **Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection** via an open-access API, and the segmentation masks are obtained using **PointRend**. The target products are sourced from the **Zalando dataset**, and the art style images come from the **WikiArt dataset**. Additionally, they mention using the **MS-COCO dataset** for training the network in the ICTT module.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection**:
   > The metropolitan museum of art open access. https://metmuseum.github.io. 2020.

2. **Zalando dataset**:
   > Jetchev, N., & Bergmann, U. (2017). The conditional analogy gan: Swapping fashion articles on people images. In ICCVW.

3. **WikiArt dataset**:
   > Nichol, K. (2016). Painter by numbers. https://www.kaggle.com/c/painter-by-numbers.

4. **MS-COCO dataset**:
   > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollar, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). Microsoft coco: Common objects in context. In ECCV.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research in the field.
