To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic speech recognition for the Nepali language using CNN, bidirectional LSTM and ResNet" by Manish Dhakal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the model was trained and tested on the **OpenSLR dataset**, which is a good lead for dataset extraction.

Next, I will look into the **Methodology** section, specifically **section II.A (Data Acquisition and Preprocessing)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They mention that the dataset consists of **157,905 audio clips with 527 unique speakers**, sampled at 16KHz, and that it is sourced from **OpenSLR**. This section also describes the preprocessing steps taken on the dataset, confirming its significance in the research.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **OpenSLR dataset**. The relevant reference is:

- **OpenSLR dataset citation**:
  > O. Kjartansson, S. Sarin, K. Pipatsrisawat, M. Jansche, and L. Ha, “Crowd-Sourced Speech Corpora for Javanese, Sundanese, Sinhala, Nepali, and Bangladeshi Bengali,” in Proc. The 6th Intl. Workshop on Spoken Language Technologies for Under-Resourced Languages (SLTU), (Gurugram, India), pp. 52–55, Aug. 2018.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the **OpenSLR dataset**, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

Now, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
