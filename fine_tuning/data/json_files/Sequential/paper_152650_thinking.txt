To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Complex Unitary Recurrent Neural Networks using Scaled Cayley Transform" by Kehelwala D. G. Maduranga et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the experiments conducted with the new architecture but does not specify any datasets. The introduction may provide more context or mention specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 5) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors describe several experiments, including:

1. **MNIST Classification**: The authors mention using the MNIST database, which consists of 55,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits.

2. **TIMIT Speech Dataset**: The authors also refer to the TIMIT dataset, which includes a training set of 3,696 audio files, a testing set of 192 audio files, and a validation set of 400 audio files.

I will now look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y., & Cortes, C. (2010). MNIST handwritten digit database. 

- For the **TIMIT dataset**, the citation is:
  > Garofolo, J. S., Lamel, L. F., Fisher, W. M., Fiscus, J. G., Pallett, D. S., Dahlgren, N. L., & Zue, V. (1993). TIMIT acoustic-phonetic continuous speech corpus ldc93sl. Technical report. Philadelphia: Linguistic Data Consortium.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
