To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparative Study of Machine Learning Models for Stock Price Prediction" by O˘gulcan E. Örsel and Sasha S. Yamada, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors applied machine learning techniques to historical stock prices, which suggests that they used specific datasets, likely consisting of stock price data.

Next, I will examine the **methods section** where the authors describe how they obtained their data. They mention using the library **yfinance** to obtain historical stock prices for individual stocks from the technology sector (e.g., MSFT, AAPL, TSLA) and well-known market indices (e.g., NASDAQ, S&P 500). This indicates that the datasets are derived from these stocks and indices.

In the **experiments section**, the authors discuss the performance of various models on specific stocks, namely **Tesla (TSLA)** and **Microsoft (MSFT)**. They provide performance metrics for these stocks, which reinforces that these are the datasets they are working with.

Now, I will look into the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific dataset citations for the stock price data itself, as it is likely sourced from the yfinance library, which aggregates data from various financial sources. However, I can note the reference for the yfinance library:

- For **yfinance**, the citation is:
  > yfinance. URL https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/.

Additionally, I will note that the stocks mentioned (MSFT, AAPL, TSLA) are publicly traded companies, and their historical stock price data can be accessed through financial databases or APIs, but specific citations for the datasets themselves are not provided in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant citations for the sources of the data used in the study. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets referenced in the research paper.
