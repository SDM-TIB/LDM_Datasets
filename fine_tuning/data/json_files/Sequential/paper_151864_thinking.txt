To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Feed-Forward Sequential Memory Networks for Speech Synthesis" by Mengxiao Bi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed DFSMN model in speech synthesis but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the database used for their experiments. Here, they mention a **vocal novel database** read by a single Mandarin male speaker, which contains 38,600 utterances (around 83 hours) for training and 1,400 utterances (around 3 hours) for validation. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **References section** that may have been used in the context of the experiments or comparisons. However, the primary dataset mentioned in the experiments is the vocal novel database.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

1. **Vocal Novel Database**: This dataset is used for training and validation in the speech synthesis experiments. It consists of recordings from a single Mandarin male speaker, totaling 38,600 utterances for training and 1,400 for validation.

Next, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the vocal novel database. However, it appears that the authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, as it seems to be a proprietary or internal dataset used by the authors.

Since the paper does not provide a full citation for the vocal novel database, I will note that down as well. 

In summary, I will create an entry for the vocal novel database, but I will indicate that a full citation is not available in the paper. 

After compiling this information, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format for further processing or review.
