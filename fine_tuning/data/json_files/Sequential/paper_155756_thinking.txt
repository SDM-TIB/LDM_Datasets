To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comparison of Automatic Labelling Approaches for Sentiment Analysis" by Sumana Biswas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the study. The abstract mentions that the experiments were evaluated on two Twitter datasets: **SemEval-2013 (DS-1)** and **SemEval-2016 (DS-2)**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Methodology)**, where the authors provide more details about the datasets. They clarify that the datasets are from the SemEval competitions and contain human labels. The paper refers to these datasets as DS-1 and DS-2, which correspond to the SemEval-2013 and SemEval-2016 datasets, respectively.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the original sources for the SemEval datasets, which are essential for proper attribution. 

The citations I need to extract are:

1. **SemEval-2013 Dataset**:
   > Mohammad, S., Kiritchenko, S., Sobhani, P., Zhu, X., and Cherry, C. (2016). SemEval-2016 Task 6: Detecting stance in tweets. In Proceedings of the 10th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2016), pages 31–41.

2. **SemEval-2016 Dataset**:
   > Deriu, J. M., Gonzenbach, M., Uzdilli, F., Lucchi, A., De Luca, V., and Jaggi, M. (2016). Swisscheese at SemEval-2016 Task 4: Sentiment classification using an ensemble of convolutional neural networks with distant supervision. In Proceedings of the 10th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2016), pages 1124–1128.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the datasets used in the research, ensuring that each dataset is properly cited.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
