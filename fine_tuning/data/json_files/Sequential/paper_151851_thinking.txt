To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ParlAI: A Dialog Research Software Platform" by Alexander H. Miller et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to "over 20 tasks" and "popular datasets such as SQuAD, bAbI tasks, MCTest, WikiQA, QACNN, QADailyMail, CBT, bAbI Dialog, Ubuntu, OpenSubtitles and VQA." This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, and I need to identify them all.

Next, I will look into **section 6 (Tasks)**, where the authors provide a detailed list of the datasets included in the first release of ParlAI. They mention specific datasets and categorize them into different types of dialog tasks. The datasets explicitly mentioned include:

1. **SQuAD**: A dataset for machine comprehension of text, which includes over 100,000 questions.
2. **bAbI tasks**: A set of tasks designed to test various aspects of dialog and reasoning.
3. **MCTest**: A dataset for machine comprehension with multiple-choice questions.
4. **WikiQA**: A dataset for question answering based on Wikipedia.
5. **QACNN**: A dataset for question answering using convolutional neural networks.
6. **QADailyMail**: A dataset for question answering based on articles from the Daily Mail.
7. **CBT**: A dataset for cloze tests (sentence completion).
8. **bAbI Dialog**: A dataset for goal-oriented dialog tasks.
9. **Ubuntu**: A dataset for multi-turn dialog in technical support.
10. **OpenSubtitles**: A dataset derived from movie subtitles for dialog modeling.
11. **VQA**: A dataset for visual question answering.

In the **References section**, I will find the full citations for these datasets. Here are the citations I will extract:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
