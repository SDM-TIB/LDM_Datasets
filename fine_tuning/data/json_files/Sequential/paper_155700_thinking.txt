To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Overlooked Video Classification in Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection" by Weijun Tan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on "three major video anomaly detection datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their research. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **UCF-Crime**: A large-scale anomaly detection dataset containing 1,900 untrimmed videos with a total duration of 128 hours, covering 13 classes of anomalies. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

2. **ShanghaiTech**: A medium-scale dataset consisting of 437 videos, including 307 normal and 130 anomaly videos, collected from a fixed street video surveillance camera.

3. **XD-Violence**: A newly released large-scale dataset with over 4,754 untrimmed videos, collected from various sources, including real-life movies and surveillance cameras.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **UCF-Crime**, the citation is:
  > W. Sultani, C. Chen, and M. Shah. *Real-world anomaly detection in surveillance videos*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

- For **ShanghaiTech**, the citation is:
  > W. Liu, D. Lian, W. Luo, and S. Gao. *Future frame prediction for anomaly detection â€“ a new baseline*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

- For **XD-Violence**, the citation is:
  > Peng Wu, Jing Liu, Yujia Shi, Yujia Sun, Fangtao Shao, Zhaoyang Wu, and Zhiwei Yang. *Not only look, but also listen: Learning multimodal violence detection under weak supervision*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets along with their full citations as required.
