To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Faster Neural Network Training with Approximate Tensor Operations" by Menachem Adelman and Mark Silberstein, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the authors applied their technique to training on **MNIST**, **CIFAR-100**, and **Penn Tree Bank** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are relevant to the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about these datasets. The introduction discusses the general applicability of approximation techniques but does not provide further details about the datasets.

I will then look into the **experiments** section, particularly any tables or figures that summarize the datasets used. In the paper, the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset** for training Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) models, the **CIFAR-100 dataset** for training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and the **Penn Tree Bank (PTB)** dataset for training Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
   > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

2. **CIFAR-100 Dataset**: The citation for the CIFAR-100 dataset is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

3. **Penn Tree Bank Dataset**: The citation for the Penn Tree Bank dataset is:
   > Mitchell P Marcus, Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz, and Beatrice Santorini. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2):313–330, 1993.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
