To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Training Heterogeneous Features in Sequence to Sequence Tasks: Latent Enhanced Multi-filter Seq2Seq Model" by Yunhao Yang and Zhaokun Xue, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using the **Geo-query dataset** and **Multi30k English-French dataset**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In **section 4.1 (Semantic Parsing in Geo-query)**, the authors explicitly mention the **Geo-query dataset** and describe its purpose: it is used for semantic parsing on geographical questions. They also provide a reference number [32] for this dataset, which I will need to retrieve the full citation later.

In **section 4.2 (Machine Translation)**, the authors discuss the **Multi30k English-French dataset**, stating that it contains 30,000 pairs of training sentences and 1,000 pairs of validation sentences. They also provide a reference number [9] for this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for both datasets:

1. For the **Geo-query dataset**, the citation is:
   > Zelle, J.M., Mooney, R.J. *Learning to parse database queries using inductive logic programming*. In Proceedings of the Thirteenth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence - Volume 2. p. 1050–1055. AAAI’96, AAAI Press (1996).

2. For the **Multi30k English-French dataset**, the citation is:
   > Elliott, D., Frank, S., Sima’an, K., Specia, L. *Multi30k: Multilingual English-German image descriptions*. Proceedings of the 5th Workshop on Vision and Language (2016). https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/w16-3210.

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper. I will ensure that I include the full citations for each dataset as they are critical for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent work or analysis.
