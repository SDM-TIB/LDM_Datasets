To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Aikyam: A Video Conferencing Utility for Deaf and Dumb" by Kshitij Deshpande et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a utility for sign language interpretation, which suggests that datasets related to sign language might be discussed.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their research. This section is divided into two parts: 

1. **Sign Language Recognition**: The authors mention a dataset recorded by the Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Educational and Research Institute, which contains video data for 8 signs. They describe how the dataset is structured, including the feature extraction process.

2. **Semantic Sentence Generation**: This part discusses a dataset that maps keywords to sentences in a healthcare context, consisting of 150 data points. The authors provide details about how the dataset is structured and its purpose in generating semantically correct sentences.

After identifying the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. 

For the **Sign Language Recognition dataset**, the citation is:
> Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Educational and Research Institute. *Video-based dataset of Indian Sign Language (ISL)*. [Dataset available on independent platform].

For the **Semantic Sentence Generation dataset**, since it is created by the authors and does not have an external citation, I will note it as:
> Kshitij Deshpande et al. *Dataset for semantic sentence generation in healthcare context*. [Dataset created for this research].

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will allow for proper attribution and facilitate further research or validation by others interested in the datasets used in this study.
