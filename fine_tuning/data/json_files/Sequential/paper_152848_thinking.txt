To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IndyLSTMs: Independently Recurrent LSTMs" by Pedro Gonnet and Thomas Deselaers, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their models on the **IAM-OnDB** and **CASIA** datasets, which suggests these are key datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experimental setup** section, specifically **section III**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they provide specific information about each dataset:

1. **IAM-OnDB**: This dataset is described as the most used evaluation dataset for online handwriting recognition, consisting of 298,523 characters in 86,272 word instances from a dictionary of 11,059 words, written by 221 writers. The authors mention the standard separation of the dataset into training and test sets.

2. **CASIA**: The authors describe this dataset as part of the ICDAR-2013 Competition for Online Handwriting Chinese Character Recognition, containing 2,693,183 samples for training and 224,590 samples for testing, produced by different writers. They note that the number of character classes is 3,755.

Additionally, the authors mention that they also used several in-house datasets, but they do not provide specific details or citations for these datasets in the paper.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the IAM-OnDB and CASIA datasets:

- For **IAM-OnDB**, the citation is:
  > M. Liwicki and H. Bunke. "IAM-OnDB-an on-line English sentence database acquired from handwritten text on a whiteboard." In ICDAR, 2005, pp. 956â€“961.

- For **CASIA**, the citation is:
  > C.-L. Liu, F. Yin, D.-H. Wang, and Q.-F. Wang. "CASIA online and offline Chinese handwriting databases." In ICDAR, 2011.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets and their citations. I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described, and the full citations are included for reference.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are accurately captured.
