To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Solving a New 3D Bin Packing Problem with Deep Reinforcement Learning Method" by Haoyuan Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the study. In this case, the authors discuss a new type of 3D bin packing problem and mention that numerical experiments are conducted based on real data. This indicates that datasets are likely involved, but I need to find specific details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the provided text, the authors mention conducting experiments with "150,000 train samples and 150,000 test samples." However, they do not specify the exact datasets used for these samples. I will need to check if there are any references to datasets in the **related work** or **methodology sections** that might provide insights into the data sources.

Since the paper does not explicitly name any datasets, I will also examine the **references section** for any cited works that might describe datasets relevant to the experiments. I will look for papers that discuss datasets used in similar contexts, such as bin packing problems or reinforcement learning applications.

After identifying potential datasets, I will ensure to extract the full citations for each dataset. If the authors refer to datasets from other studies, I will include those citations as well. For instance, if they reference a dataset used in previous research, I will provide the citation for that original work.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial insights on datasets.
2. Search for a dedicated datasets section or mentions in the experiments section.
3. Review related work and methodology for any dataset references.
4. Check the references section for citations of relevant datasets.
5. Compile the dataset information with full citations for each identified dataset.
