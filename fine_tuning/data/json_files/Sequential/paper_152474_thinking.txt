To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Residual Memory Networks: Feed-forward approach to learn long temporal dependencies" by Murali Karthick Baskar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the experimental analysis conducted on the AMI corpus and the Switchboard corpus, indicating that these are likely the datasets used.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Experimental setup)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **AMI Corpus**: This dataset is described as containing recordings of meetings, specifically mentioning that it includes 77 hours of training data and 9 hours each for development and evaluation. This dataset is crucial for their experiments on automatic speech recognition.

2. **Switchboard Corpus**: The authors state that they trained their models using 300 hours of data from the Switchboard corpus, which is a well-known dataset for speech recognition tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **AMI Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Carletta, J., et al. "The AMI Meeting Corpus: A Pre-Announcement." In Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Multimodal Interfaces (ICMI), 2000.

- For the **Switchboard Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Godfrey, J. J., Holliman, E. C., & McDaniel, J. (1992). "SWITCHBOARD: Telephone speech corpus for research and development." In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 1992.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
