To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving the Efficiency of Grammatical Error Correction with Erroneous Span Detection and Correction" by Mengyun Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the efficiency of their approach in grammatical error correction (GEC) and hints at the use of benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using several datasets for training and evaluation. Specifically, they list:

1. **FCE (The First Certificate in English)**: This dataset is used for fine-tuning and contains 0.5 million sentences.
2. **Lang-8 Corpus of Learner English**: Another dataset for fine-tuning with 1.04 million sentences.
3. **NUCLE (NUS Corpus of Learner English)**: This dataset is also used for fine-tuning and contains 57.1K sentences.
4. **W&I+LOCNESS**: This dataset is used for fine-tuning and contains 34.3K sentences.
5. **CoNLL-2014**: This dataset is used for testing and contains 1,312 sentences.
6. **BEA-2019**: This dataset is used for testing and contains 4,477 sentences.
7. **CoNLL-2013**: This dataset is used for development and contains 1,381 sentences.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The authors reference several papers that describe these datasets, which will help in constructing the citations.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that all datasets are accurately represented with their full citations.
