To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Audio-visual target speaker enhancement on multi-talker environment using event-driven cameras" by Ander Arriandiaga et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of event-driven cameras and hints at the need for datasets for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the importance of audio-visual speech separation and mention that existing methods require large datasets. This suggests that they may reference specific datasets later in the paper.

In the **methods section**, I will look for any explicit mention of datasets used for training or evaluation. Here, the authors specifically state that they used the **GRID dataset** for their experiments. They describe the dataset as consisting of 3-second audio and video recordings of 34 speakers pronouncing 1000 sentences, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **experimental setup section** where the authors provide more details about how they utilized the GRID dataset, including the number of sentences and speakers used for training, validation, and testing. This confirms the dataset's relevance to their work.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the GRID dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For the **GRID dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Cooke, J. Barker, S. Cunningham, and X. Shao. *An audio-visual corpus for speech perception and automatic speech recognition*. The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, vol. 120, no. 5, pp. 2421â€“2424, November 2006. Available: http://link.aip.org/link/?JAS/120/2421/1

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the dataset details and ensure that I include the full citation for the GRID dataset as it is critical for proper attribution.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing or review.
