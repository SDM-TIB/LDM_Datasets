To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Performance of LSTM Neural Networks in Nowcasting during the COVID-19 Crisis" by Daniel Hopp, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that might be mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses nowcasting of macroeconomic variables during the COVID-19 crisis, which suggests that there may be datasets related to economic indicators.

Next, I will examine **section 3.1 (Description of data and models)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for the empirical analysis. Here, the author mentions three target variables: global merchandise exports in both values and volumes, and global services exports. I will look for specific references to the datasets used to derive these variables.

In this section, the author cites two sources for the datasets:
1. **WTO (2020)** for global merchandise exports in values.
2. **UNCTAD (2021)** for both global merchandise exports in volumes and global services exports.

I will also check the **appendix** for any additional details about the datasets, including the variables used in model estimation. The appendix lists various economic indicators and their sources, which may provide further context for the datasets.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The citations are as follows:

- For **global merchandise exports in values**:
  > WTO. (2020). *Statistics on merchandise trade*. Available at https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/statis_e/merch_trade_stat_e.htm (accessed 1 November 2020).

- For **global merchandise exports in volumes** and **global services exports**:
  > UNCTAD. (2021). *UNCTADStat*. Available at https://unctadstat.unctad.org/EN/Index.html (accessed 11 January 2021).

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets and their citations, as this is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or downstream processing, ensuring that all relevant details are included and correctly formatted.
