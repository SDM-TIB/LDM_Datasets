To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Information-Theoretic Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization with Continuous Approximations" by Syrine Belakaria et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, features, or specific characteristics that define the datasets.

In this paper, the authors mention several real-world engineering design optimization problems. I will extract the datasets associated with these problems:

1. **Analog Circuit Design Optimization**: This dataset involves the design of a voltage regulator via a Cadence circuit simulator. The authors mention that this dataset has 33 input variables and optimizes nine objectives. 

2. **Panel Structure Design for Large Vessels**: This dataset focuses on optimizing the trade-off between weight and strength of the panel, with six input variables.

3. **Rocket Launching Simulation**: The dataset for this problem includes three input variables (mass of fuel, launch height, and launch angle) and three objective functions (return time, angular distance, and launch angle difference).

4. **Network-on-Chip**: This dataset consists of 1024 configurations of a network-on-chip with ten input variables, optimizing two objectives (latency and energy).

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the datasets are derived from existing literature or benchmarks, I will ensure to include those citations as well.

For example, if the authors reference specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note those citations. If they do not provide explicit references, I will summarize the datasets based on the information provided in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation where applicable. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
