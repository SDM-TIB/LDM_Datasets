To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Spoken Utterance Classification" by Shahab Jalalvand and Srinivas Bangalore, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the need for large amounts of supervised in-domain data for spoken utterance classification, which suggests that datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. In this section, the authors provide a table (Table 1) that outlines the statistics of the datasets, including the total number of utterances, intent labels, and para-phrases for each dataset. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Generic Dataset**: This dataset consists of 5.3 million utterances covering six domains, including finance, healthcare, and retail. It has 5,200 unique intents.

2. **In-domain Dataset**: This dataset is specific to the insurance domain, containing 156 unique intents and 456 para-phrases.

3. **Expanded Dataset**: This dataset is created through data expansion using para-phrases as seeds and the generic corpus as the data pool.

4. **Test Dataset**: This dataset includes 1,200 utterances with 68 unique intents, also from the insurance domain.

I will also look for any additional details or context about these datasets in the surrounding text to ensure I have a comprehensive understanding of their characteristics and usage.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites a previous work by Jalalvand et al. (2018) regarding the data expansion algorithm, which is relevant for the **Expanded Dataset**. The citation for this work is:

- Jalalvand, S., Ljolje, A., & Bangalore, S. (2018). Automatic Data Expansion for Customer-care Spoken Language Understanding. CoRR, abs/1810.00670.

For the **Generic Dataset**, since it is described as a large corpus covering multiple domains, I will note that it does not have a specific citation provided in the paper, but it is implied to be a well-known dataset in the field.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations where applicable. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
