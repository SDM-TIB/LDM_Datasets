To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Meta-Learning via Feature-Label Memory Network" by Dawit Mureja, Hyunsin Park, and Chang D. Yoo, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their model's performance using the **Omniglot** and **miniMNIST** datasets, which suggests these are the primary datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (specifically sections 5.1 and 5.4) to gather more details about how these datasets are utilized. In section 5.1, the authors describe the **Omniglot dataset**, which consists of 1623 characters from 50 different alphabets, with 20 samples per class. This dataset is ideal for one-shot learning tasks. In section 5.4, they mention using the **miniMNIST dataset**, which contains 20 image samples per class randomly selected from the original MNIST dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Omniglot dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lake, B. M.; Salakhutdinov, R.; Gross, J.; and Tenenbaum, J. B. *One shot learning of simple visual concepts*. In Proceedings of the 33rd Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society, 2011.

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y.; Cortes, C.; and Burges, C. J. C. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. 1998.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
