To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DL based analysis of movie reviews" by Mary Pa and Amin Kazemi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors used "almost 500KB pairs of balanced data from the IMDb movie review databases" to train their model. This indicates that the IMDb dataset is a key dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of the dataset in the **methodology** section. In this section, the authors describe the IMDb dataset in detail, noting that it contains 500KB of reviews that have already been classified into "positive" and "negative" groups. This confirms that the IMDb dataset is the primary dataset used for their analysis.

I will also check the **experiments** and **results** sections to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors provide further context about the IMDb dataset. However, it appears that the focus remains on the IMDb dataset throughout the paper.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the IMDb dataset. The paper does not provide a direct citation for the IMDb dataset itself, but I can reference the general source of the dataset:

- For the **IMDb dataset**, the citation is:
  > IMDb. *IMDb Datasets*. [Online]. Available: https://datasets.imdbws.com/

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will summarize my findings:

1. **IMDb Dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis of movie reviews, containing 500KB of classified reviews.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the information is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
