To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparing skill of historical rainfall data based monsoon rainfall prediction in India with NCEP-NWP forecasts" by Apoorva Narula et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used historical daily gridded precipitation data for India from the IMD and NCEP-NWP forecasts, which suggests that these are the primary datasets of interest.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Data and Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **IMD Daily Gridded Precipitation Data**: This dataset spans from 1901 to 2022 and has a spatial resolution of 1° × 1°. It is crucial for their analysis of rainfall prediction.

2. **NCEP-NWP Forecasts**: This dataset includes numerical weather prediction forecasts available from 2011 to 2022, also at a spatial resolution of 1° × 1°. It is used for comparison against the IMD data.

In the **data preparation section**, the authors describe how they align the IMD and NCEP datasets for their analysis, confirming that both datasets are indeed utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **IMD Daily Gridded Precipitation Data**, the citation is:
  > Madhaven Rajeevan, Pulak Guhathakurta, and V. Thapliyal. *Analysis of variability and trends of extreme rainfall events over India using 104 years of gridded daily rainfall data*. Geophysical Research Letters, 35(18), 2008.

- For the **NCEP-NWP Forecasts**, the citation is:
  > Copernicus Climate Change Service. *Seasonal forecast daily and subdaily data on single levels*, 2018.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant information is accurately captured for future reference or analysis.
