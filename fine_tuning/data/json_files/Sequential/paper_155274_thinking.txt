To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NeuralTailor: Reconstructing Sewing Pattern Structures from 3D Point Clouds of Garments" by Maria Korosteleva and Sung-Hee Lee, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges in garment reconstruction and mention the need for a dataset that includes 3D garment models and their corresponding sewing patterns. This indicates that a dataset is indeed utilized in their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset they used. They mention the "Dataset of 3D garments with sewing patterns" and provide details about its contents, including the number of garments, types, and the specific features included in each sample. This section is crucial as it contains the necessary information about the dataset.

The dataset is described as covering a variety of garment designs, including t-shirts, jackets, pants, skirts, jumpsuits, and dresses, with a total of 22,000 garments sampled from 19 base types. Each garment sample includes a 3D model, a corresponding sewing pattern, and a corrupted 3D model to simulate scanning artifacts.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors cite their own previous work, which is essential for providing the complete reference.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Korosteleva, M., & Lee, S.-H. (2021a). Dataset of 3D Garments with Sewing Patterns. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5267549

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation as required.

In summary, I will extract the following dataset information:
1. **Dataset Name**: Dataset of 3D garments with sewing patterns
2. **Description**: Covers a variety of garment designs, including variations of t-shirts, jackets, pants, skirts, jumpsuits, and dresses, with 22,000 garments sampled from 19 base types. Each garment sample contains a 3D model, a corresponding sewing pattern, and a corrupted 3D model imitating scanning artifacts.
3. **Full Citation**: Korosteleva, M., & Lee, S.-H. (2021a). Dataset of 3D Garments with Sewing Patterns. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5267549

After gathering this information, I will prepare it for output in the required format.
