To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Automatic Parsing of Log Records" by Jared Rand and Andriy Miranskyy, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss datasets** (particularly section 3, which is titled "Logs under study"). The abstract mentions the creation of synthetic Apache log records and the evaluation of models on real-world logs, indicating that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of log analysis and the need for automated parsing, which sets the context for the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Logs under study)**, where the authors describe both synthetic and real-world datasets. Here, they mention the creation of synthetic logs and the use of three publicly available log files for validation, which they label as **VA, VB, and VC**. 

1. **Synthetic Datasets**:
   - The authors created five synthetic datasets for training and testing:
     - **TT**: Contains 100,000 ELF mock logs.
     - **TE**: Contains 20,000 logs with a mix of ELF, CLF, and randomly generated records.
     - **TM**: Contains a mix of formats with 100,000 records, approximately 50% in CLF format.
     - **T' M**: A shorter version of TM with 20,000 records.
     - **TH**: Contains 100,000 randomly generated records.

2. **Real-World Datasets**:
   - The authors specify three real-world log files:
     - **VA**: Log file from Netsparker.
     - **VB**: Log file from Acunetix.
     - **VC**: Sample Apache web server log file.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the real-world datasets are as follows:

- For **Netsparker log file (VA)**:
  > Ocatak. (2021). *Netsparker log file*. Available: https://github.com/ocatak/apache-http-logs/blob/master/netsparker.txt

- For **Acunetix log file (VB)**:
  > Ocatak. (2021). *Acunetix log file*. Available: https://github.com/ocatak/apache-http-logs/blob/master/acunetix.txt

- For **Apache web server log file (VC)**:
  > Elastic. (2021). *Sample Apache web server log file*. Available: https://github.com/elastic/examples/blob/master/Common%20Data%20Formats/apache%20logs/apache%20logs

For the synthetic datasets, since they are generated by the authors and not publicly available as standalone datasets, I will note that they are described in the paper but do not have external citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for the real-world datasets and a brief description of the synthetic datasets, ready for structured output or further processing.
