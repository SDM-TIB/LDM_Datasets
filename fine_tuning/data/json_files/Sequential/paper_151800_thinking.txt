To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GNAS: A Greedy Neural Architecture Search Method for Multi-Attribute Learning" by Siyu Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on "three benchmark multi-attribute datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **CelebA Dataset**: This dataset consists of 200,000 images with annotations for 40 binary attributes. The authors specify the distribution of images for training, validation, and testing.

2. **LFWA Dataset**: This dataset contains 13,143 images, with a specific split for training and validation. The authors also mention the attributes associated with this dataset.

3. **Market-1501 Attribute Dataset**: This dataset annotates 23 person attributes on the original Market-1501 dataset, which includes a total of 32,688 images.

To ensure accuracy, I will check the **References section** for the full citations of these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CelebA Dataset**:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In ICCV, 2015.

- For **LFWA Dataset**:
  > Gary B. Huang, Manu Ramesh, Tamara Berg, and Erik Learned-Miller. *Labeled Faces in the Wild: A Database for Studying Face Recognition in Unconstrained Environments*. Technical Report 07-49, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, 2007.

- For **Market-1501 Attribute Dataset**:
  > Liang Zheng, Liyue Shen, Lu Tian, Shengjin Wang, Jingdong Wang, and Qi Tian. *Scalable person re-identification: A benchmark*. In ICCV, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets along with their full citations as required.
