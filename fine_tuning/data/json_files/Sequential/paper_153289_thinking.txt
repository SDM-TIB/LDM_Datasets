To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distanced LSTM: Time-Distanced Gates in Long Short-Term Memory Models for Lung Cancer Detection" by Riqiang Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on three datasets, which is a strong indication that I should look for specific names and details of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (specifically section 3) where the authors describe their experimental design and results. Here, they mention three datasets: 

1. **Tumor-CIFAR**: This is a synthetic dataset created to simulate benign and malignant cancer on natural images. The authors provide details about the dataset's structure, including the number of samples and the simulation methodology.

2. **National Lung Screening Trial (NLST)**: The authors specify that they used a subset of 1794 subjects from this large-scale trial, which is publicly available and focuses on early diagnosis of lung cancer.

3. **Clinical Data from Two Institutional Cohorts**: This dataset consists of 1420 subjects from two clinical sources, which are also evaluated in the study.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Tumor-CIFAR**, since it is a newly created dataset by the authors, I will note that it is publicly available and refer to the GitHub link provided in the paper for access.

- For **National Lung Screening Trial (NLST)**, the citation is:
  > National Lung Screening Trial Research Team. *The national lung screening trial: overview and study design*. Radiology, 258(1), 243-253, 2011.

- For the **clinical datasets**, since they are derived from two institutional cohorts, I will note that specific citations for these datasets are not provided in the paper. However, I will mention the sources: Molecular Characterization Laboratories (MCL) and Vanderbilt Lung Screening Program (VLSP).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations and relevant details for each dataset as described in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
