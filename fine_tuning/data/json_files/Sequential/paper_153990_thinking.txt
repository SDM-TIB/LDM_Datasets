To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Architecture Optimization with Graph VAE" by Jian Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can hint at the types of data used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention that their training dataset consists of **19,020 neural architectures from the ENAS software**. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used, and I need to gather more details about it.

In the experiments section, the authors specify that the architectures include **6 nodes** sampled from **6 different operations**: 3 × 3 convolution, 3 × 3 separable convolution, 5 × 5 convolution, 5 × 5 separable convolution, average pooling, and max pooling. This gives me a better understanding of the dataset's structure and content.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the ENAS dataset. The authors reference the ENAS software in the following way:

- For the **ENAS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hieu Pham, Melody Y Guan, Barret Zoph, Quoc V Le, and Jeff Dean. *Efficient neural architecture search via parameter sharing*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.03268, 2018.

Since the authors do not mention any other datasets in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

I will create an entry for the ENAS dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will allow for proper attribution and reference in any further analysis or use of the dataset.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset used in the research paper, ready for any downstream processing or review.
