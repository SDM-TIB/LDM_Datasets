To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prediction of Wort Density with LSTM Network" by Derk Rembold et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced or described. The abstract discusses the use of sensors and a neural network to predict wort density, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **data gathering** section (2.1) to see if the authors provide details about the data they collected. Here, they describe the experimental setup and mention that they collected sensor data, but they do not specify any named datasets yet.

I will then look at the **prediction of wort density** section (3) to see if there are any references to datasets used for training the LSTM model. The authors mention that they collected target values by measuring wort density using spindles and refractometers, but again, they do not provide specific dataset names.

In the **results** section (3.2), the authors discuss the training and validation of the LSTM network using data from 24 fermentation processes. They mention that they executed 31 fermentation processes in total, but they do not provide a formal dataset name or citation.

Since the paper does not explicitly name any datasets or provide full citations, I will need to look at the **References section** to see if any of the cited works correspond to datasets that could be relevant. I will check the references for any papers that might describe datasets related to fermentation processes or wort density measurements.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that several papers discuss methodologies and datasets related to fermentation processes, but none of them are explicitly named as datasets used in this study. The authors refer to their own data collected during the experiments, but they do not provide a formal dataset citation.

Given this analysis, it appears that the authors did not use any publicly available datasets but rather collected their own data during the fermentation experiments. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is proprietary to this research and does not have a formal citation.

In summary, I will document the following:

1. **Dataset Name**: Proprietary dataset from fermentation experiments.
   - **Description**: Collected sensor data and target values for wort density prediction from 31 fermentation processes.
   - **Citation**: Not applicable, as no formal dataset citation is provided.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
