To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Pedestrian Actions to Ensure Safe Autonomous Driving" by Jia Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to evaluating their method on the **Joint Attention Autonomous Driving (JAAD) dataset**, **CARLA simulation data**, and **real-time self-driving shuttle data**. This indicates that there are at least three datasets involved.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experimental evaluation** sections to gather more details about these datasets. In the methodology section, the authors describe the **JAAD dataset** in detail, noting that it focuses on pedestrian and driver behaviors in urban settings, with specific annotations for pedestrian actions. They also mention the **CARLA** simulator as an open-source tool for autonomous driving research, which is used to generate simulation data.

In the **experimental evaluation** section, the authors confirm that they evaluate their models using the **JAAD dataset** and **CARLA simulation data**, as well as data collected from a self-driving shuttle on a university campus. This reinforces the identification of the datasets.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Joint Attention Autonomous Driving (JAAD) Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > A. Rasouli, I. Kotseruba, and J. K. Tsotsos. "Are they going to cross? A benchmark dataset and baseline for pedestrian crosswalk behavior." In ICCVW, 2017, pp. 206–213.

2. **CARLA Simulation Data**:
   - Citation:
     > A. Dosovitskiy, G. Ros, F. Codevilla, A. Lopez, and V. Koltun. "CARLA: An open urban driving simulator." In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning, 2017, pp. 1–16.

3. **Real-time Self-Driving Shuttle Data**:
   - This dataset is collected by the authors and does not have a formal citation in the references section. However, it is important to note that it is based on real-time data collected on the Texas A&M university campus.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented, including its purpose and any relevant details provided in the paper. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of pedestrian action prediction for autonomous driving.
